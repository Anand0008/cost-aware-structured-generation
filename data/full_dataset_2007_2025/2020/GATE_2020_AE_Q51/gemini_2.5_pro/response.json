The damping ratio ($\\xi$) for such a system is defined as the ratio of the actual damping coefficient (C) to the critical damping coefficient ($C_{critical}$). The critical damping coefficient is given by $C_{critical} = 2\\sqrt{k m}$, where $k$ is the spring stiffness and $m$ is the mass. Therefore, the damping ratio is $\\xi = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k m}}$.\n\nInitially, the system is critically damped, which means $\\xi_{org} = 1$. So, for the original state:\n$1 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}$\nThis implies $C = 2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}$ (Equation 1)\n\nAfter softening of the spring, the system becomes overdamped with a new damping ratio $\\xi_{new} = 1.2$. The problem states that other parameters (mass $m$ and damping coefficient $C$) remain unchanged. So, for the new state:\n$1.2 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$ (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n$1.2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$\n$1.2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the original spring stiffness to the new spring stiffness ($\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}$), we square both sides of the equation:\n$(\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}) = (1.2)^2$\n$(\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}) = 1.44$\n\nThe calculated value 1.44 falls within the specified range of 1.43 to 1.45, confirming the correctness of the answer."

          "Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal. The system is a single degree of freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper. Initially, it is critically damped ($\\xi_{org} = 1$). After a change, it becomes overdamped with a new damping ratio ($\\xi_{new} = 1.2$). The mass ($m$) and damping coefficient ($C$) remain unchanged. The goal is to find the ratio of original spring stiffness to new spring stiffness ($\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}$).",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for the damping ratio ($\\xi$) for an SDOF system. The damping ratio is defined as $\\xi = \\frac{C}{C_{critical}}$, where $C$ is the actual damping coefficient and $C_{critical}$ is the critical damping coefficient. The critical damping coefficient is given by $C_{critical} = 2\\sqrt{k m}$, where $k$ is the spring stiffness and $m$ is the mass. Combining these, $\\xi = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k m}}$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the damping ratio formula to the original (critically damped) condition. Since $\\xi_{org} = 1$, we have $1 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}$. This allows us to express the damping coefficient $C$ in terms of $k_{org}$ and $m$: $C = 2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the damping ratio formula to the new (overdamped) condition. Since $\\xi_{new} = 1.2$, we have $1.2 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the expression for $C$ from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4. This eliminates $C$ and allows us to relate $k_{org}$ and $k_{new}$: $1.2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$.",
          "Step 6: Simplify the equation. The $2$ and $\\sqrt{m}$ terms cancel out, leaving $1.2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$.",
          "Step 7: Solve for the required ratio. Square both sides of the equation to find $\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}} = (1.2)^2$.",

    "question_text": "A critically damped single degree of freedom spring-mass-damper system used in a door closing mechanism becomes overdamped due to softening of the spring with extended use. If the new damping ratio (ξnew) for overdamped condition is 1.2, the ratio of the original spring stiffness to the new spring stiffness (korg / knew), assuming that the other parameters remain unchanged, is __________ (round off to two decimal places)"
