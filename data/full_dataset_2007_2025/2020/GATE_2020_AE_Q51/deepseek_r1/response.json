The system is initially critically damped, so $\\zeta_{org} = 1$. This implies $c = c_{cr,org} = 2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}$. After spring softening, the damping ratio becomes $\\zeta_{new} = 1.2$ with the same mass (m) and damping coefficient (c). Therefore, $\\zeta_{new} = c / (2\\sqrt{k_{new} m})$. Substituting the expression for 'c' from the initial condition and solving for the stiffness ratio $k_{org}/k_{new}$ yields the answer."

If the new damping ratio (ξnew) for overdamped condition is 1.2, the ratio of the original spring stiffness to the new spring stiffness (korg / knew), assuming that the other parameters remain unchanged, is __________ (round off to two decimal places)"
