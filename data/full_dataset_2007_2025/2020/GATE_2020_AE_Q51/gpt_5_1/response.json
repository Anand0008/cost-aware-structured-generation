After softening of the spring, the damping coefficient c and mass m remain unchanged but stiffness changes to $k_{new}$, and the new damping ratio is $\\xi_{new} = 1.2$. Taking the ratio of the two expressions for damping ratio and cancelling common terms: \\n$\\frac{\\xi_{new}}{\\xi_{org}} = \\frac{c/(2\\sqrt{k_{new} m})}{c/(2\\sqrt{k_{org} m})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$. With $\\xi_{new} = 1.2$ and $\\xi_{org} = 1$, we get $1.2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$, so $\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}} = (1.2)^2 = 1.44$.

Numerical manipulation for stiffness ratio came from internal reasoning."
