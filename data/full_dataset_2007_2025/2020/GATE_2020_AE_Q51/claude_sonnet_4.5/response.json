To find the ratio of the original spring stiffness (k_org) to the new spring stiffness (k_new), we can use the relationship between the damping ratio, natural frequency, and stiffness:\n\nzeta = c / (2 * sqrt(k * m))\n\nSince the mass (m) and damping coefficient (c) remain unchanged, the increase in zeta from 1.0 to 1.2 must be due to a decrease in the stiffness (k). Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nk_org / k_new = (zeta_new / zeta_critical)^2 = (1.2 / 1.0)^2 = 1.44\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives the final answer of 1.43 to 1.45."
