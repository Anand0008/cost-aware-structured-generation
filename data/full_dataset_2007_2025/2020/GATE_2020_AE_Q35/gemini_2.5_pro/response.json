        "reasoning": "The problem requires solving a system of linear equations `AX = B` where `A` is specified as an orthogonal matrix. The fundamental property of an orthogonal matrix `A` is that its inverse is equal to its transpose, i.e., `A^{-1} = A^T`. Therefore, the solution for `X` can be directly found by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by `A^T`: `A^T (AX) = A^T B \\implies (A^T A) X = A^T B \\implies IX = A^T B \\implies X = A^T B`. Once the explicit matrix `A` (which was missing from the provided question text but would have been present in the original exam paper) is known, `X = [x y z]^T` can be calculated by performing the matrix-vector multiplication `A^T B`. Finally, the sum `x + y + z` is computed from the components of `X`. Without the explicit matrix `A`, the numerical calculation cannot be performed by the model. However, assuming the original GATE question provided `A` and the calculation was performed correctly, the given answer range `0.9 to 1.1` is accepted as correct based on the provided answer key."
