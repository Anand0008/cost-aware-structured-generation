        "reasoning": "The question asks for the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:15. To solve this, we need to calculate the angular position of each hand relative to the 12 o'clock mark (which we can consider $0^\\circ$).\n\n1.  **Minute Hand Position:** The minute hand completes a full $360^\\circ$ in 60 minutes. Therefore, its speed is $360^\\circ / 60 \text{ minutes} = 6^\\circ/\text{minute}$.\n    At 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is exactly at the '3' mark.\n    Angle of minute hand from 12 o'clock = $15 \text{ minutes} \\times 6^\\circ/\text{minute} = 90^\\circ$.\n\n2.  **Hour Hand Position:** The hour hand completes a full $360^\\circ$ in 12 hours. Therefore, its speed is $360^\\circ / 12 \text{ hours} = 30^\\circ/\text{hour}$.\n    It also moves $30^\\circ / 60 \text{ minutes} = 0.5^\\circ/\text{minute}$.\n    At 3:15, the hour hand has moved past the '3' mark. Its position is determined by 3 full hours plus 15 minutes of movement.\n    Angle of hour hand from 12 o'clock = $(3 \text{ hours} \\times 30^\\circ/\text{hour}) + (15 \text{ minutes} \\times 0.5^\\circ/\text{minute})$\n    $= 90^\\circ + 7.5^\\circ = 97.5^\\circ$.\n\n3.  **Angle Between Hands:** The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their angular positions.\n    Angle = $|\\text{Angle of hour hand} - \\text{Angle of minute hand}|$\n    Angle = $|97.5^\\circ - 90^\\circ| = 7.5^\\circ$.\n\nThus, the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:15 is $7.5^\\circ$, which corresponds to option B."
