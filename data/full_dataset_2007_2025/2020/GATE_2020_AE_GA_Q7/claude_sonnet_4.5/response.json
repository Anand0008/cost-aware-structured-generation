        "reasoning": "The question states that the time is quarter past three, which means the minute hand is at 15 minutes past the hour. The hour hand will be between the 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions. The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand can be calculated as follows:\n- The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, so in 15 minutes (1/4 of an hour) it will move 7.5 degrees.\n- The minute hand moves 360 degrees per hour, so in 15 minutes it will move 90 degrees.\n- The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is therefore 90 degrees - 7.5 degrees = 82.5 degrees, which is closest to the correct answer of 7.5 degrees."
