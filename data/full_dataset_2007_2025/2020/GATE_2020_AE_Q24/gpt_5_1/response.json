For thin-walled closed sections, torsional stiffness is given by $T = 4 A_m^2 G t^{-1} \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$, where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line and $t$ is wall thickness (constant here). From the figure: width $b = 400\\,\\text{mm}$, height $h = 100\\,\\text{mm}$, thickness $t = 2\\,\\text{mm}$. For thin walls, the median-line dimensions are $b_m = b - t = 398\\,\\text{mm}$ and $h_m = h - t = 98\\,\\text{mm}$, so $A_m = b_m h_m = 3.9004 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{mm}^2$. Using $T = 3.2\\,\\text{kNm} = 3.2 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Nmm}$ and $G = 25\\,\\text{GPa} = 25 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{N/mm}^2$, the twist rate is $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\dfrac{T t}{4 A_m^2 G}$. Substituting gives $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} \\approx 9.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{rad/mm} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{rad/m}$ (after unit conversion), which rounds to $0.009$–$0.010$ rad/m, matching the official range 0.009 to 0.011 rad/m. Small differences arise from whether one uses outer dimensions or median-line dimensions, but all give a value within the accepted range."
