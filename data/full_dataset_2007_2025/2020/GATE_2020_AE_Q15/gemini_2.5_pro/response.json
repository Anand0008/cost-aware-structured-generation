        "reasoning": "As per fundamental principles of jet propulsion and consistently confirmed by multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), 'perfectly expanded flow' (also referred to as optimally, ideally, or correctly expanded flow) in an aircraft engine nozzle occurs when the static pressure of the exhaust gases at the nozzle exit ($P_e$ or $P_{\\text{exit}}$) is equal to the ambient static pressure ($P_0$ or $P_{\\text{ambient}}$). This condition is crucial because it eliminates the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_0)A_e$ from the general thrust equation, thereby maximizing the conversion of the exhaust gas's internal energy into kinetic energy without any external pressure losses or gains. Option C, 'the ambient pressure at the nozzle exit,' directly matches this definition."

          "Step 1: Understand the primary function of a jet engine nozzle, which is to accelerate the hot exhaust gases to a high velocity to generate propulsive thrust.",
          "Step 2: Recall the general thrust equation for an air-breathing engine, which includes two main components: momentum thrust and pressure thrust. The pressure thrust term is given by $(P_e - P_0)A_e$, where $P_e$ is the static pressure at the nozzle exit, $P_0$ is the ambient static pressure, and $A_e$ is the nozzle exit area.",
          "Step 3: Define 'perfectly expanded flow.' This is an ideal design condition where the nozzle is shaped such that the static pressure of the exhaust gases upon exiting the nozzle ($P_e$) is exactly equal to the surrounding ambient static pressure ($P_0$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the implication of this condition on the thrust equation. When $P_e = P_0$, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_0)A_e$ becomes zero. This signifies that all available pressure energy has been efficiently converted into kinetic energy, and there are no additional forces due to pressure imbalances at the nozzle exit.",
          "Step 5: Compare this definition with the given options. Option C, 'the ambient pressure at the nozzle exit,' directly corresponds to the condition $P_e = P_0$ for perfectly expanded flow.",
          "Step 6: Eliminate other options. Stagnation pressures (Options A and B) are incorrect as perfectly expanded flow refers to static pressure. Nozzle inlet static pressure (Option D) is typically much higher than the exit pressure and ambient pressure, so it is also incorrect."
