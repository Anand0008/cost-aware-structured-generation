        "reasoning": "The Phugoid mode eigenvalues are given in the standard form `$\\lambda = \\sigma \\pm i \\omega_d$`. From this, the damping coefficient `$\\sigma = -0.02$ rad/s` and the damped natural frequency `$\\omega_d = 0.25$ rad/s` are identified. The undamped natural frequency `$\\Omega_n$` is related to these by `$\\Omega_n = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\omega_d^2}$`. Calculating this yields `$\\Omega_n \\approx 0.250798$ rad/s`. For the Phugoid mode, a widely used approximation for the natural frequency in stable cruise flight at low angle of attack is `$\\Omega_n \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_0}$`, where `g` is acceleration due to gravity and `U_0` is the equilibrium speed. By rearranging this formula to solve for `U_0` and substituting the calculated `$\\Omega_n$` and given `g = 9.8 m/s^2`, we get `U_0 \\approx 55.255$ m/s. Rounding to two decimal places gives `55.26 m/s`, which falls within the specified correct answer range of 55.20 to 55.33."

However, the specific approximation $\\Omega_n \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_0}$ crucial for solving this problem (as $Z_U$ was not provided) was not explicitly present in the RAG context. The solution therefore relied on internal knowledge for this standard approximation, building upon the general Phugoid understanding from RAG."
