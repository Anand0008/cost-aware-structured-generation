From this, the equilibrium speed of the aircraft in steady level cruise can be calculated using the formula $\\Omega_n = \\sqrt{g \\cdot Z_u / U_0}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $Z_u$ is a stability derivative. Plugging in the given eigenvalues and $g = 9.8 m/s^2$ yields a natural frequency $\\Omega_n \\approx 0.26 rad/s$. Rearranging the formula gives $U_0 \\approx 55.20$ to $55.33 m/s$, which matches the correct answer."
