        "reasoning": "Aerodynamic forces and moments are fundamentally generated by the integration of pressure and shear stress distributions over the entire wetted surface of a body. Pressure acts normal to the surface, and shear stress acts tangentially. Given the complete geometry (which defines the elemental surface area $\\text{dA}$ and position vector $\\vec{r}$) and the distributions of pressure ($p$) and shear stress ($\\vec{\\tau}_w$), one can directly compute the total force vector $\\vec{F}$ and total moment vector $\\vec{M}$ by performing surface integrals. Once the dimensional forces and moments are known, their respective coefficients (force coefficient $C_F$ and moment coefficient $C_M$) can be calculated by non-dimensionalizing them with the dynamic pressure, reference area, and reference length. Therefore, the most direct and fundamental quantities that can be estimated from these distributions are the force and the moment on the body."

The formulas require the complete geometry of the body (to define the elemental surface area $dA$, the unit normal vector $\\vec{n}$, the unit tangential vector $\\vec{t}$, and the position vector $\\vec{r}$) and the distributions of pressure ($p$) and shear stress ($\\vec{\\tau}_w$) over the surface.",

With all the necessary information (geometry, pressure distribution, shear stress distribution), the direct outputs of these surface integrals are the dimensional total force $\\vec{F}$ and total moment $\\vec{M}$ acting on the body.",

While force and moment coefficients ($C_F$, $C_M$) are important non-dimensional parameters, they are derived from the dimensional forces and moments.
