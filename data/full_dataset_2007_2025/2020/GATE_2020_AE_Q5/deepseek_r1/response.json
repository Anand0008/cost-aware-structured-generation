Given complete geometry and distributions, these integrations yield the actual force and moment vectors. However, dimensionless coefficients (e.g., force coefficient, moment coefficient) require normalization by freestream dynamic pressure (0.5*ρ_inf*V_inf^2) and reference areas/lengths, which are not provided. Therefore, with the given data, one can estimate the force and moment on the body, but not their coefficients. Options A, B, and C include coefficients, which cannot be estimated without freestream conditions."
