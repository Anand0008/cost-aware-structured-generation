By rearranging and integrating, it can be transformed into the standard equation of a circle. The steps are as follows:\n1.  Rearrange the equation: `x dx/dy = c - y`\n2.  Separate variables: `x dx = (c - y) dy`\n3.  Integrate both sides: `\\int x \\,dx = \\int (c - y) \\,dy`\n4.  Perform integration: `\\frac{x^2}{2} = cy - \\frac{y^2}{2} + K`, where `K` is the integration constant.\n5.  Multiply by 2 to clear denominators: `x^2 = 2cy - y^2 + 2K`\n6.  Rearrange terms to group `x` and `y` terms: `x^2 + y^2 - 2cy = 2K`\n7.  Let `C_0 = 2K` (another arbitrary constant). The equation becomes: `x^2 + y^2 - 2cy = C_0`\n8.  To identify the curve, complete the square for the `y` terms. Add `c^2` to both sides: `x^2 + (y^2 - 2cy + c^2) = C_0 + c^2`\n9.  This simplifies to: `x^2 + (y - c)^2 = C_0 + c^2`\n10. Let `R^2 = C_0 + c^2`. The equation is `x^2 + (y - c)^2 = R^2`.\nThis is the standard equation of a circle with center `(0, c)` and radius `R`. Thus, the equation represents a family of circles."
