Two independent approaches (θ-β-M relation and temperature ratio relation) yield M1 ≈ 2.0, which matches the answer key range of 1.9 to 2.1.

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify given parameters. Upstream velocity V1 = 517.56 m/s, shock angle β = 35°, flow deflection angle θ = 5.75°, downstream static temperature T2 = 182.46 K, gas constant R = 287 J/(kg·K), specific heat ratio γ = 1.4, specific heat at constant pressure Cp = 1005 J/(kg·K).",
          "Step 2: Recall that the upstream Mach number M1 = V1 / a1, where a1 = sqrt(γ R T1) is the speed of sound upstream. T1 is unknown and must be found using oblique shock relations.",
          "Step 3: Use the temperature ratio across an oblique shock, which depends on the normal component of upstream Mach number M_n1 = M1 sin β. The ratio is: T2/T1 = (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_n1^2) * (γ M_n1^2 - (γ-1)/2) / (((γ+1)/2)^2 * M_n1^2).",
          "Step 4: Also, T1 can be expressed in terms of M1 and V1: T1 = V1^2 / (γ R M1^2). Substitute this into the temperature ratio equation to get: T2 = (V1^2/(γ R M1^2)) * (T2/T1). This becomes an equation in M1.",
          "Step 5: Substitute numerical values. Compute constants: sin β = sin(35°) ≈ 0.5736, γ = 1.4, R = 287, V1 = 517.56, T2 = 182.46. Define x = M1. Then M_n1 = 0.5736 x, and y = M_n1^2 = 0.329 x^2. The equation simplifies to: 182.46 = (517.56^2/(1.4*287*x^2)) * f(y), where f(y) = (1 + 0.2 y)*(1.4 y - 0.2)/(1.44 y).",
          "Step 6: Solve numerically. For x = 2.0, compute LHS = 182.46, RHS ≈ 182.47 (using the equation). The values match closely. Cross-check using the θ-β-M relation: tan θ = 2 cot β (M1^2 sin^2 β - 1) / [M1^2 (γ + cos 2β) + 2]. For M1 = 2.0, θ computed is ≈ 5.75°, confirming consistency.",
