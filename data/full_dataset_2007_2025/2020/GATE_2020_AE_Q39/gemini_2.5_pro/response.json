    "question_text": "An oblique shock is inclined at an angle of 35 degrees to the upstream flow of velocity 517.56 m/s. The deflection of the flow due to this shock is 5.75 degrees and the temperature downstream is 182.46 K. Assume the gas constant R = 287 J/(kg K), specific heat ratio γ = 1.4, and specific heat at constant pressure Cp = 1005 J/(kg K). Using conservation relations, the Mach number of the upstream flow can be obtained as __________ (round off to one decimal place)."
