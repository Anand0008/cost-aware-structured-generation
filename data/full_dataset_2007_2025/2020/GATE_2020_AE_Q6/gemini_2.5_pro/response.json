The right vortex ($V_R$) rotates clockwise, which is assigned a negative circulation, $-\\Gamma$.\n\n2.  **Velocity Induced by a Single Vortex:** The magnitude of the velocity induced by an infinitely long line vortex of strength $\\Gamma$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ is given by the formula: $w = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$.\n\n3.  **Velocity Induced by $V_L$ at the location of $V_R$:**\n    *   The perpendicular distance from $V_L$ to $V_R$ is $r = h$.\n    *   The magnitude of the velocity induced by $V_L$ at $V_R$'s location is $w_{L \\to R} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$.\n    *   Since $V_L$ is a positive (counter-clockwise) vortex, the fluid it induces at a point to its right (where $V_R$ is located) will be directed upwards, i.e., in the $+y$ direction.\n\n4.  **Velocity Induced by $V_R$ at the location of $V_L$:**\n    *   The perpendicular distance from $V_R$ to $V_L$ is also $r = h$.\n    *   The magnitude of the velocity induced by $V_R$ at $V_L$'s location is $w_{R \\to L} = \\frac{|-\\Gamma|}{2\\pi h} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$.\n    *   Since $V_R$ is a negative (clockwise) vortex, the fluid it induces at a point to its left (where $V_L$ is located) will also be directed upwards, i.e., in the $+y$ direction.\n\n5.  **Motion of the Vortices:** Each vortex moves with the velocity induced by the *other* vortex.
