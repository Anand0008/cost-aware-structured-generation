        "reasoning": "Each infinitely long line vortex induces a velocity field given by the line-vortex formula. For a straight vortex filament of circulation strength $\\Gamma$, the induced tangential velocity at perpendicular distance $h$ is $w = \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$, directed tangentially around the vortex (Biot–Savart result). In the configuration shown, the two vortices have equal and opposite sense (counter-rotating) and are separated by distance $h$ along the x-axis. Consider the right vortex: the left vortex induces at its location a velocity that is purely in the $+y$ direction with magnitude $\\Gamma/(2\\pi h)$. Similarly, the right vortex induces the same magnitude velocity at the left vortex, also in $+y$. Thus both vortices move together as a translating pair in the $+y$ direction, each with speed $\\Gamma/(2\\pi h)$. There is no net rotation about the midpoint because the induced velocities at each vortex are parallel and equal, not centripetal about the center. Therefore option C is correct."

          "Step 2: Place the two vortices on the x-axis, separated by distance $h$. Let the left vortex have circulation $+\\Gamma$ (counter-clockwise) and the right vortex have circulation $-\\Gamma$ (clockwise), as implied by 'counter-rotating'.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate the velocity induced by the left vortex at the location of the right vortex. The distance between them is $h$, so the magnitude is $\\dfrac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$. From the circulation sense, this induced velocity at the right vortex points in the $+y$ direction.",
          "Step 4: Similarly, evaluate the velocity induced by the right vortex at the location of the left vortex. The magnitude is again $\\dfrac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$, and the direction is also $+y$ at the left vortex.",
          "Step 5: Since each vortex only feels the velocity induced by the other (self-induced velocity is not defined for an ideal line vortex), both vortices move with the same speed $\\dfrac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi h}$ in the $+y$ direction. Their separation remains constant, so the pair translates without rotating about the midpoint.",
