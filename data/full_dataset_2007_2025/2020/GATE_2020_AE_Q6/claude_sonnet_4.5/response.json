        "reasoning": "The question asks about the motion of the pair of counter-rotating line vortices shown in the image. Based on the information provided, the vortices will translate along the +y direction with a velocity at the line vortex equal to Γ/(2πh), where Γ is the circulation strength and h is the separation distance between the vortices. This is because the induced velocity from one vortex on the other is perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex centers, and the two induced velocities are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net translation. The tangential velocity at the line vortex is not related to the motion of the vortex pair, so options A, B, and D are incorrect."
