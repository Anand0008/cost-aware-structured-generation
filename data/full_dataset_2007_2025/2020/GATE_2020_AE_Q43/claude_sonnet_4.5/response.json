The ratio of tangential velocities at perihelion and aphelion is given as 1.0339.\n2. Using the formula for tangential velocity ($v_t = \\sqrt{\\mu/r}$), we can relate the tangential velocities at perihelion and aphelion to the eccentricity ($e$) and semi-major axis ($a$) of the orbit.\n3. Simplifying the expression, we get: $e = \\sqrt{1 - (v_{t,perihelion}/v_{t,aphelion})^2}$\n4. Plugging in the given ratio of 1.0339, we get $e \\approx 0.017$, which falls within the correct answer range of 0.016 to 0.018."
