        "reasoning": "The problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of angular momentum for a two-body orbit. At perihelion (closest point) and aphelion (farthest point), the velocity vector is purely tangential, and thus the angular momentum per unit mass (h) is given by `h = r \\times v`. Therefore, `r_p v_p = r_a v_a`, where `r_p` and `v_p` are the radius and tangential velocity at perihelion, and `r_a` and `v_a` are at aphelion. This implies `v_p / v_a = r_a / r_p`. For an elliptical orbit, the perihelion distance is `r_p = a(1 - e)` and the aphelion distance is `r_a = a(1 + e)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis and `e` is the eccentricity. Substituting these into the ratio gives `v_p / v_a = (a(1 + e)) / (a(1 - e)) = (1 + e) / (1 - e)`. Given `v_p / v_a = 1.0339`, we have `1.0339 = (1 + e) / (1 - e)`. Solving for `e`: `1.0339(1 - e) = 1 + e \\implies 1.0339 - 1.0339e = 1 + e \\implies 0.0339 = 2.0339e \\implies e = 0.0339 / 2.0339 \\approx 0.016667`. Rounding to three decimal places yields `0.017`. This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 0.016 to 0.018."

          "**Step 2: Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum.** For a two-body problem in an elliptical orbit, angular momentum per unit mass (`h`) is conserved. At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector, so `h = r \\times v`. Therefore, the angular momentum at perihelion equals that at aphelion: `$r_p v_p = r_a v_a$`.",
          "**Step 3: Relate Velocity Ratio to Radius Ratio.** From the conservation of angular momentum, rearrange the equation to express the ratio of velocities in terms of radii: `$\\frac{v_p}{v_a} = \\frac{r_a}{r_p}$`.",
