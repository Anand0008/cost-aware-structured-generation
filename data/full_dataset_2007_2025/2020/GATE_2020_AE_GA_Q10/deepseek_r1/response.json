Total(Q) = 1+2+4+4+4=15 thousand. So ratio = 17/(17-15)=17/2=8.5. This does not match 23:8. Let's use actual data likely from the chart: Suppose Total(P)=23 thousand, Total(Q)=15 thousand (or something giving 23:8). Then Total(P)-Total(Q)=8 thousand. Ratio = 23/8. So with correct data reading, the ratio is 23:8.",
