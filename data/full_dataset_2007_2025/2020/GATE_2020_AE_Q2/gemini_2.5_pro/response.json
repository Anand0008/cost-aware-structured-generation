        "reasoning": "The question asks for the maximum of a function `f(x)` where `$\\sigma$` and `$\\mu$` are constants. Although the explicit form of `f(x)` is not provided, the presence of parameters `$\\mu$` (mean) and `$\\sigma$` (standard deviation) strongly suggests that `f(x)` is the probability density function (PDF) of a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The standard form of a Gaussian PDF is given by: \\n\\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$$\\n\\nTo find the maximum of this function, we need to maximize the exponential term, as `$\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$` (or `$\\lambda$` if `$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$`) is a positive constant and does not affect the location of the maximum. The exponential term `$e^A$` is maximized when its exponent `A` is maximized. In this case, the exponent is `$-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$`. Since this exponent is always non-positive, it is maximized when its absolute value, `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$`, is minimized. \\n\\nThe term `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$` is always non-negative. Its minimum value is 0, which occurs when `$(x-\\mu)^2 = 0$`. This implies `x - \\mu = 0`, which means `x = \\mu`. \\n\\nTherefore, the maximum of the Gaussian function occurs at `x = \\mu`. This corresponds to option D."

          "Step 1: Identify the implicit function. Given the parameters `$\\mu$` and `$\\sigma$` in the context of finding a maximum, the function `f(x)` is implicitly assumed to be the probability density function of a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Its standard form is `$f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$`.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the function's structure. The function consists of a positive constant term (either `$\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$` or `$\\lambda$`, if `$\\lambda$` is defined as this constant) and an exponential term `$e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$`. To maximize `f(x)`, we only need to maximize the exponential term, as the constant factor does not change the `x` value at which the maximum occurs.",
          "Step 3: Maximize the exponential term. An exponential function `$e^A$` is maximized when its exponent `A` is maximized. Here, `A = -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}`.",
          "Step 4: Minimize the squared term. Since `A` is a non-positive quantity, maximizing `A` means making its absolute value, `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$`, as small as possible. The term `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$` is always non-negative.",
          "Step 5: Determine `x` for minimum. The minimum possible value for `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$` is 0. This occurs when the numerator is zero, i.e., `$(x-\\mu)^2 = 0$`.",
          "Step 6: Solve for `x`. From `$(x-\\mu)^2 = 0$`, we get `x - \\mu = 0`, which simplifies to `x = \\mu`.",
