        "reasoning": "The diffusion equation `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$` with the initial condition `u(x, 0) = e^{-x^2}` has the exact solution: `u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t + 1}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{4\\alpha t + 1}}`. \\n\\nAt `x=0`, the solution simplifies to `u(0, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t + 1}}`. \\n\\nWe need to find the ratio `u(0,1) / u(0,4)`:\\n`u(0,1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha(1) + 1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha + 1}}`\\n`u(0,4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha(4) + 1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{16\\alpha + 1}}`\\n\\nThe ratio is `\\frac{u(0,1)}{u(0,4)} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{4\\alpha + 1}}{1/\\sqrt{16\\alpha + 1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\alpha + 1}{4\\alpha + 1}}`.\\n\\nThe problem does not provide a value for `$\\alpha$`. However, the expected answer range (1.9 to 2.1) suggests that an approximation is intended. If `$\\alpha t \\gg 1$` (i.e., `$\\alpha$` is large or `t` is large), then `$\\sqrt{4\\alpha t + 1} \\approx \\sqrt{4\\alpha t}$` and `$\\sqrt{16\\alpha t + 1} \\approx \\sqrt{16\\alpha t}$`.\\n\\nApplying this approximation:\\n`\\frac{u(0,1)}{u(0,4)} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\alpha}{4\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2`.\\n\\nThis value of 2.0 falls perfectly within the given range of 1.9 to 2.1. The statement about the similarity solution `u(x,t) = u(\\eta)` where `$\\eta = x / \\sqrt{\\alpha t}$` is a potential distractor, as the exact solution for a Gaussian initial condition does not strictly reduce to a function of `$\\eta$` alone without this approximation. However, the approximation makes the solution behave like a similarity solution in terms of the scaling of the peak value."

          "Step 1: Identify the governing equation and initial condition. The governing equation is the 1D diffusion equation: `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$`. The initial condition is `u(x, 0) = e^{-x^2}`.",
          "Step 2: Recall or derive the exact solution for the diffusion equation with a Gaussian initial condition. For `u(x, 0) = e^{-ax^2}`, the solution is `u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4a\\alpha t}} e^{-\\frac{ax^2}{1 + 4a\\alpha t}}`. In this problem, `a=1`, so the solution is `u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{1 + 4\\alpha t}}$`.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate the solution at `x=0`. Substitute `x=0` into the exact solution: `u(0, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha t}} e^{-\\frac{0^2}{1 + 4\\alpha t}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha t}}$`.",

          "Step 5: Form the ratio `u(0,1) / u(0,4)`. \\n`\\frac{u(0,1)}{u(0,4)} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha}}{1/\\sqrt{1 + 16\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 16\\alpha}{1 + 4\\alpha}}$`.",
          "Step 6: Apply the necessary approximation. Since no value for `$\\alpha$` is given and a numerical answer is expected within a narrow range, it implies that `$\\alpha$` is large enough such that `1` is negligible compared to `4\\alpha t` and `16\\alpha t`.

However, the exact solution for a Gaussian initial condition was not directly provided by RAG, requiring internal knowledge. The RAG also did not explicitly suggest the approximation needed to resolve the missing 'alpha' parameter, which was crucial for solving the NAT question."
