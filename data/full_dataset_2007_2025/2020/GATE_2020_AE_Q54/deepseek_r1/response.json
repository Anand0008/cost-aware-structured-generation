    "question_text": "An airplane of mass 4000 kg and wing reference area 25 m² flying at sea level has a maximum lift coefficient of 1.65. Assume density of air as 1.225 kg/m³ and acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s². Using a factor of safety of 1.25 to account for additional unsteady lift during a sudden pull-up, the speed at which the airplane reaches a load factor of 3.2 is __________ m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
