        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the speed at which an airplane reaches a load factor of 3.2, considering a factor of safety of 1.25 for unsteady lift during a pull-up. The core principles involved are the definition of load factor and the lift equation.\n\n1.  **Calculate Weight (W):**\n    $W = m \\times g = 4000 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 39200 \\text{ N}$\n\n2.  **Interpret Factor of Safety (FS):** The phrase \"factor of safety of 1.25 to account for additional unsteady lift during a sudden pull-up\" implies that the given load factor of 3.2 is the *limit* or *design* load factor that the aircraft can withstand, which already incorporates a safety margin for dynamic/unsteady effects. Therefore, to find the *effective steady-state load factor* ($n_{effective}$) that would produce this limit, we must divide the given load factor by the factor of safety:\n    $n_{effective} = \\frac{n_{given}}{\\text{FS}} = \\frac{3.2}{1.25} = 2.56$\n\n3.  **Determine Lift Coefficient ($C_L$):** The problem provides $C_{L,max} = 1.65$. In performance calculations where a specific $C_L$ for the maneuver is not given, it is standard practice to assume the aircraft is operating at its maximum lift coefficient ($C_L = C_{L,max}$) to achieve the specified load factor at the minimum possible speed.\n    So, $C_L = 1.65$.\n\n4.  **Apply Load Factor Definition and Lift Equation:**\n    By definition, Lift ($L$) is related to load factor ($n$) and weight ($W$) as $L = nW$.\n    The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$.\n    Equating these two expressions for lift:\n    $n_{effective} W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$\n\n5.  **Solve for Speed (V):** Rearrange the equation to solve for $V$:\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 n_{effective} W}{\\rho S C_L}}$\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 2.56 \\times 39200 \\text{ N}}{1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 25 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 1.65}}$\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{200704}{50.4375}}$\n    $V = \\sqrt{3979.244}$\n    $V \\approx 63.081 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, $V = 63.08 \\text{ m/s}$, which falls within the specified correct answer range."

    "question_text": "An airplane of mass 4000 kg and wing reference area 25 m² flying at sea level has a maximum lift coefficient of 1.65. Assume density of air as 1.225 kg/m³ and acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s². Using a factor of safety of 1.25 to account for additional unsteady lift during a sudden pull-up, the speed at which the airplane reaches a load factor of 3.2 is __________ m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
