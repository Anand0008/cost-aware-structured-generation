The maximum available steady lift is L_max = 0.5 ρ V^2 S C_{L,max}. However, the problem states that during a sudden pull-up there is additional unsteady lift, accounted for by a factor of safety of 1.25. This effectively increases the usable lift coefficient to C_{L,eff} = 1.25 C_{L,max}. Setting nW = 0.5 ρ V^2 S C_{L,eff} and solving for V gives V = sqrt(2 n W / (ρ S C_{L,eff})). Substituting W = mg = 4000×9.8 N, n = 3.2, ρ = 1.225 kg/m^3, S = 25 m^2, and C_{L,eff} = 1.25×1.65 = 2.0625 yields V ≈ 63.0 m/s, which lies within the official answer range 62.95–63.08 m/s."

While they did not directly address pull-up speed with a safety factor, they provided the core concept of load factor n = L/W and lift equations, which are relevant. The specific maneuvering speed calculation and use of a 1.25 unsteady lift factor were derived from internal knowledge."

Assume density of air as 1.225 kg/m³ and acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s². Using a factor of safety of 1.25 to account for additional unsteady lift during a sudden pull-up, the speed at which the airplane reaches a load factor of 3.2 is __________ m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
