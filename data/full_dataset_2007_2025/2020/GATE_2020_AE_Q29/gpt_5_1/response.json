        "reasoning": "The stepped cantilever has two prismatic segments in series: a left segment of length 2 m with moment of inertia I, and a right segment of length 1 m with moment of inertia 3I, fixed at the right end. A load P is applied at the free left end. For a cantilever with variable EI, the deflection at the free end can be obtained by integrating the curvature: $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{M(x)}{E I(x)}$. Taking x from the fixed end (x = 0) to the free end (x = 3 m), the bending moment is $M(x) = P(3 - x)$ everywhere because the external load is at x = 3 m. The flexural rigidity is $EI(x) = 3EI$ for $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $EI$ for $1 < x \\le 3$. Integrating twice with continuity of slope and deflection at the step (x = 1) and zero slope and deflection at the fixed end (x = 0) yields the deflection at x = 3: $y(3) = \\dfrac{43 P}{3 E I}$. This matches option C. The RAG context includes standard cantilever deflection derivations and a variable-I example, which confirm the method and boundary conditions."

For stepped beams with constant moment along the length, the total deflection is the sum of deflections each segment would undergo if it alone carried the load with appropriate boundary conditions.",
