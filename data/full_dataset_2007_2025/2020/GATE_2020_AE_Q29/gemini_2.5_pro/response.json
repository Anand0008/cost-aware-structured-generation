        "reasoning": "The problem involves calculating the deflection of a stepped cantilever beam under a point load at its free end. The most straightforward methods for this are the Moment-Area Method or the Unit Load Method (also known as Virtual Work Method). Both methods yield the same result. \n\nUsing the Unit Load Method (or Virtual Work Method):\n1.  **Actual Bending Moment (M(x))**: Let 'x' be the distance measured from the free end. The bending moment at any section 'x' due to the applied load 'P' is `M(x) = -P * x`. (Negative sign indicates hogging moment for a downward load).\n2.  **Virtual Bending Moment (m(x))**: To find the deflection at the free end, apply a unit virtual load (P'=1) at the free end. The virtual bending moment at any section 'x' is `m(x) = -1 * x`.\n3.  **Deflection Formula**: The deflection `$\\delta$` at the free end is given by `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{M(x) m(x)}{EI(x)} dx$`.\n    Substituting `M(x)` and `m(x)`: `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{(-Px)(-x)}{EI(x)} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{Px^2}{EI(x)} dx$`.\n4.  **Integrate over Sections**: The beam has two sections with different moments of inertia:\n    *   Section 1: From `x=0` to `x=2m`, `EI(x) = EI`.\n    *   Section 2: From `x=2m` to `x=3m` (total length is 2m + 1m = 3m), `EI(x) = 3EI`.\n    So, `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{Px^2}{EI} dx + \\int_{2}^{3} \\frac{Px^2}{3EI} dx$`\n5.  **Calculate Integral for Section 1**: \n    `$\\delta_1 = \\frac{P}{EI} \\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = \\frac{P}{EI} [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{0}^{2} = \\frac{P}{EI} (\\frac{2^3}{3} - 0) = \\frac{8P}{3EI}$`\n6.  **Calculate Integral for Section 2**: \n    `$\\delta_2 = \\frac{P}{3EI} \\int_{2}^{3} x^2 dx = \\frac{P}{3EI} [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{2}^{3} = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{3^3}{3} - \\frac{2^3}{3}) = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{19}{3}) = \\frac{19P}{9EI}$`\n7.  **Total Deflection**: \n    `$\\delta = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = \\frac{8P}{3EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{24P}{9EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{43P}{9EI}$`\n8.  **Substitute Load Value**: The image specifies the load `P = 3N`. \n    `$\\delta = \\frac{43 \\times 3}{9EI} = \\frac{129}{9EI} = \\frac{43}{3EI}$`\n\nThis result matches option C."

The total length is `3 m`, with the first `2 m` from the free end having `EI` and the next `1 m` having `3EI`. The load `P` is given as `3N` in the image.",
          "Step 2: Determine the bending moment `M(x)` along the beam. Taking the origin `x=0` at the free end, the bending moment at any section `x` is `M(x) = -P * x` (hogging moment).",
          "Step 3: Apply the Unit Load Method (Virtual Work Principle). To find the deflection at the free end, apply a unit virtual load `P'=1` at the free end. The virtual bending moment `m(x)` at any section `x` is `m(x) = -1 * x`.",
          "Step 4: Set up the integral for total deflection. The deflection `$\\delta$` is given by `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{M(x) m(x)}{EI(x)} dx$`. Substitute `M(x)` and `m(x)`: `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{Px^2}{EI(x)} dx$`.",
          "Step 5: Split the integral into two parts based on the varying moment of inertia. For `0 \\le x \\le 2m`, `EI(x) = EI`. For `2m < x \\le 3m`, `EI(x) = 3EI`. So, `$\\delta = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{Px^2}{EI} dx + \\int_{2}^{3} \\frac{Px^2}{3EI} dx$`.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate each integral. The first integral yields `$\\frac{8P}{3EI}$`. The second integral yields `$\\frac{19P}{9EI}$`.",
          "Step 7: Sum the contributions from both sections to find the total deflection: `$\\delta = \\frac{8P}{3EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{24P + 19P}{9EI} = \\frac{43P}{9EI}$`.",

Chunk 4 specifically discussed a cantilever with variable moment of inertia using the moment-area method, which is directly applicable.

The RAG content was excellent for solving this problem."
