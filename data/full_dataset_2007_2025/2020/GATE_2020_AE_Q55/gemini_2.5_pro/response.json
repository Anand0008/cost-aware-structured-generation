Finally, the equivalent airspeed is derived from the true airspeed and the ratio of local to sea-level densities.

Chunk 3 also provided a compressible flow example, which was useful for context but not directly applied here due to the low Mach number. The RAG context was highly relevant and directly supported the solution methodology, particularly in guiding the atmospheric property calculations and airspeed formulas."

Take the sea level conditions as, pressure = 1.01 bar, temperature = 288.16 K, and density = 1.225 kg/m³. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s² and the gas constant is 287 J/(kg K). Assuming standard atmosphere, the equivalent airspeed for this airplane is __________ m/s (round off to two decimal place)."
