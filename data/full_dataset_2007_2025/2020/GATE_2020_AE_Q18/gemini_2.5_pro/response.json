        "reasoning": "The question pertains to the natural frequency of a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section. Since no concentrated mass is mentioned at the free end, it is assumed that the vibration is due to the beam's own distributed mass. For a beam undergoing transverse vibration, governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$) for the $n$-th mode is given by the general relationship: $\\omega_n = \\frac{(\\beta_n L)^2}{L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$. Here, $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the area moment of inertia, $\\rho$ is the material density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $(\\beta_n L)$ is an eigenvalue parameter specific to the mode number ($n$) and boundary conditions. For a cantilever beam, $(\\beta_1 L)$ for the first mode is a constant (approximately 1.875). Since the material ($E, \\rho$) and cross-section ($I, A$) remain the same, the term $\\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$ is constant. Also, $(\\beta_n L)^2$ is constant for the first mode. Therefore, the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ is inversely proportional to the square of the beam's length ($L^2$), i.e., $\\omega_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$.\n\nLet the initial natural frequency be $\\omega_1 = \\omega$ and the initial length be $L_1 = L$. The new length is $L_2 = 2L$. We need to find the new frequency $\\omega_2$.\n\nUsing the proportionality:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{1/L_2^2}{1/L_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nTherefore, $\\omega_2 = \\frac{\\omega}{4}$. This matches option A."

          "Step 1: Identify the physical system and the relevant theory. The question describes a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section and asks for its natural frequency. Since no concentrated mass is mentioned, the problem refers to the transverse vibration of a beam with distributed mass, which is governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.",
          "Step 2: Recall or derive the general formula for the natural frequency of a beam. For transverse vibration of a beam, the natural angular frequency $\\omega_n$ for the $n$-th mode is generally expressed as $\\omega_n = \\frac{(\\beta_n L)^2}{L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$. Here, $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the area moment of inertia, $\\rho$ is the material density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $(\\beta_n L)$ is an eigenvalue parameter determined by the boundary conditions and mode number.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the parameters that remain constant and those that change. The problem states that the material (hence $E$ and $\\rho$) and cross-section (hence $I$ and $A$) remain the same. For the first mode of a cantilever beam, the eigenvalue parameter $(\\beta_1 L)$ is a fixed constant (approximately 1.875). The only parameter that changes is the length $L$.",
          "Step 4: Establish the proportionality between natural frequency and length. From the formula in Step 2, since $E, I, \\rho, A$ and $(\\beta_n L)$ are constant, the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ is inversely proportional to the square of the length $L$. This can be written as $\\omega_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$.",
          "Step 5: Apply the given change in length. Let the initial length be $L_1$ and the initial natural frequency be $\\omega_1 = \\omega$. The new length is $L_2 = 2L_1$ (length is doubled).",
          "Step 6: Calculate the new natural frequency. Using the proportionality from Step 4, we can set up a ratio:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{1/L_2^2}{1/L_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\right)^2$\nSubstitute $L_2 = 2L_1$:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{2L_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\nTherefore, the new frequency $\\omega_2 = \\frac{\\omega}{4}$ rad/s."
