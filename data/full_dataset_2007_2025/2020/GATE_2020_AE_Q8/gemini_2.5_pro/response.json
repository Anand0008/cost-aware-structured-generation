        "reasoning": "The question asks which option increases the Mach number of a supersonic flow in a duct. Let's analyze each option based on compressible flow principles:\n\n1.  **A. Increasing the length of the duct:** In adiabatic flow through a constant-area duct with friction (Fanno flow), supersonic flow always decelerates towards Mach 1. Therefore, increasing the length of the duct would cause the Mach number to decrease, not increase (as per RAG Chunk 5).\n\n2.  **B. Adding heat to the flow:** In frictionless flow through a constant-area duct with heat addition (Rayleigh flow), adding heat to a supersonic flow causes its Mach number to decrease, approaching Mach 1 (as explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 4, and 5). This is a critical concept in scramjet combustor design, where a diverging passage is used to counteract this Mach number reduction (RAG Chunk 1).\n\n3.  **C. Removing heat from the flow:** This is the inverse of adding heat. If adding heat to supersonic flow decreases the Mach number, then removing heat (cooling) from supersonic flow will cause its Mach number to increase, moving it further away from Mach 1 on the supersonic branch of the Rayleigh curve. This is the correct option.\n\n4.  **D. Inserting a convergent-divergent section with the same cross-sectional area at its inlet and exit planes:** For supersonic flow, a converging duct causes the Mach number to decrease, while a diverging duct causes it to increase (RAG Chunk 3). A convergent-divergent (CD) section would first cause deceleration in the converging part and then acceleration in the diverging part. If the flow remains supersonic throughout, the net effect on Mach number at the exit (especially if inlet and exit areas are the same) is not necessarily an increase, and could even lead to shock formation and overall deceleration. A purely diverging duct would increase supersonic Mach number, but a CD section is not guaranteed to provide a net increase."

          "Step 3: Analyze Option A (Increasing the length of the duct). This relates to Fanno flow (adiabatic flow with friction). For supersonic flow, friction causes deceleration, meaning the Mach number decreases towards 1. Thus, increasing length decreases Mach number.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option B (Adding heat to the flow). This relates to Rayleigh flow. For supersonic flow (M > 1), adding heat causes the Mach number to decrease, approaching Mach 1. This is a fundamental concept in supersonic combustion (RAG Chunks 1, 4, 5).",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option C (Removing heat from the flow). This is the opposite of adding heat. If heat addition decreases supersonic Mach number, then heat removal (cooling) must increase the Mach number, moving it further into the supersonic regime.",
          "Step 6: Analyze Option D (Inserting a convergent-divergent section). For supersonic flow, a converging section decelerates the flow, and a diverging section accelerates it (RAG Chunk 3). A convergent-divergent section would involve both. While the diverging part would accelerate the flow, the converging part would decelerate it. The net effect, especially with identical inlet and exit areas, is not a guaranteed increase in Mach number, and could lead to complex flow phenomena like shocks.",

Chunk 5 also helped rule out (A) by mentioning Fanno flow. Chunks 2 and 3 provided context for area change effects, helping to analyze option D. The RAG context was highly relevant and comprehensive for this question."
