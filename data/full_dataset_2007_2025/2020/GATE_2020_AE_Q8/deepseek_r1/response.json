        "reasoning": "For a supersonic flow in a constant area duct, the effect of heat addition/removal is governed by Rayleigh flow principles. From retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 4, 5, 6): Heat addition in supersonic flow decreases the Mach number (towards Mach 1). Conversely, heat removal (cooling) increases the Mach number. For option A (increasing duct length), considering Fanno flow (adiabatic flow with friction), increasing length causes supersonic flow to decelerate towards Mach 1. For option D (inserting a C-D section with same inlet/exit area), if the flow is supersonic and isentropic, the Mach number returns to its original value at the exit (same area ratio). It does not guarantee an increase. Only option C (removing heat) directly results in an increase in Mach number for supersonic flow."

          "Step 2: Analyze each option using the appropriate theory.",
          "Step 3 (Option A): Increasing duct length introduces more wall friction (Fanno flow). For supersonic Fanno flow, friction causes the Mach number to decrease towards Mach 1. So Mach number does not increase.",
          "Step 4 (Option B): Adding heat (Rayleigh flow). For supersonic inlet, heat addition decreases Mach number (towards Mach 1), as per Chunks 1, 4, 5, 6. So Mach number does not increase.",
          "Step 5 (Option C): Removing heat (Rayleigh flow). The opposite of heat addition. For supersonic flow, cooling increases the Mach number (away from Mach 1). This is the correct option.",
          "Step 6 (Option D): Inserting a convergent-divergent section with same inlet/exit area. For isentropic supersonic flow, the Mach number at exit equals the inlet Mach number if the area ratio is the same (A_exit/A_throat = A_inlet/A_throat). Thus, no net increase. If shocks occur, Mach number would decrease. Therefore, this option does not guarantee an increase."

        "notes": "RAG provided excellent coverage of Rayleigh flow effects (Chunks 1, 4, 5, 6) directly supporting analysis of options B and C. Chunk 2 and 3 provided background on C-D nozzles/ducts, relevant for option D. However, explicit Fanno flow relations (for option A) were only briefly mentioned in Chunk 5. Overall, RAG was very helpful for the core concepts."
