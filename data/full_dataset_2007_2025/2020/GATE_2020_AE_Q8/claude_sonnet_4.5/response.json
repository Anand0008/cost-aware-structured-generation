This is because heat addition in supersonic flow tends to decrease the Mach number, as described by the Rayleigh flow equations. Conversely, removing heat will allow the flow to accelerate, increasing the Mach number. The other options (A, B, D) will either have no effect or decrease the Mach number in a supersonic duct."
