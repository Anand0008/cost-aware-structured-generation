        "reasoning": "For a supersonic flow in a constant-area duct, the main 1D models are: Fanno flow (friction, adiabatic), Rayleigh flow (heat transfer, no friction), and isentropic flow with area change. Known behaviors:\n- Rayleigh (heat addition/removal in constant area): For supersonic flow, adding heat drives Mach number down toward 1 (thermal choking), while removing heat drives Mach number up (away from 1). This is explicitly stated in the RAG: supersonic + heat addition → M decreases; supersonic + heat removal → M increases.\n- Fanno (friction in constant area): For supersonic flow, friction decreases Mach number toward 1; increasing duct length only increases friction, so M decreases, not increases.\n- Isentropic area change: For supersonic flow, a diverging section (area increase) increases Mach number; a converging section decreases it. A symmetric convergent–divergent insert with the same inlet and exit area will, for a given upstream and downstream pressure, not guarantee a net Mach increase at the exit plane; the overall constant inlet–exit area plus possible shocks makes this option ambiguous and certainly not generally \"always increases M\".\nEvaluating options:\nA. Increasing duct length → more friction (Fanno) → supersonic M decreases.\nB. Adding heat → Rayleigh supersonic → M decreases.\nC. Removing heat → Rayleigh supersonic → M increases. This directly matches theory.\nD. Inserting a CD section with same inlet/exit area: whether exit Mach increases depends on pressure ratio and possible shocks; it is not a guaranteed way to increase Mach number for a given duct. Hence only C is unambiguously correct."

No detailed formulas were needed beyond qualitative trends."
