Since the vertical tail is located behind the aircraft's center of gravity, this rightward force creates a yawing moment that turns the nose of the aircraft to the left. A leftward yaw is conventionally defined as a negative yawing moment ($C_N < 0$). Therefore, for a positive $\\delta_r$ resulting in a negative $C_N$, the yaw control derivative $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} = \\frac{\\partial C_N}{\\partial \\delta_r}$ must be **negative** ($C_{n_{\\delta_r}} < 0$). This is supported by RAG Chunk 1.\\n\\n2.  **Roll Control Derivative ($C_{l_{\\delta_r}}$):** The same positive rudder deflection (trailing edge left) that creates a rightward force on the vertical tail also induces a rolling moment. For conventional aircraft, the vertical tail's center of pressure is typically located above the aircraft's longitudinal (roll) axis. This means the rightward force acts above the roll axis, creating a moment that tends to roll the aircraft right wing up. A right-wing-up roll is conventionally defined as a positive rolling moment ($C_L > 0$). Therefore, for a positive $\\delta_r$ resulting in a positive $C_L$, the roll control derivative $C_{l_{\\delta_r}} = \\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial \\delta_r}$ must be **positive** ($C_{l_{\\delta_r}} > 0$). This is supported by RAG Chunks 2, 5, and 6.\\n\\nCombining these, the correct option is A: $C_{l_{\\delta_r}} > 0$ and $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} < 0$."
