        "reasoning": "For conventional airplanes, a positive rudder deflection \\(\\delta_r>0\\) is defined as trailing edge to the left. From the RAG context (Prof. A.K. Ghosh, lecture 26 new), this deflection produces a side force on the vertical tail to the right (positive Y). Because the tail is aft of the CG, this rightward force generates a yawing moment that turns the nose to the left (negative yawing moment coefficient). Therefore the yaw control derivative \\(C_N_{\\delta_r}=\\partial C_N/\\partial \\delta_r\\) is negative: \\(C_N_{\\delta_r}<0\\). The same side force, acting above the roll axis (typical high vertical tail), produces a rolling moment that raises the right wing (positive rolling moment coefficient). Hence the roll control derivative due to rudder, \\(C_L_{\\delta_r}=\\partial C_L/\\partial \\delta_r\\), is positive: \\(C_L_{\\delta_r}>0\\). Thus the correct combination is \\(C_{l_{\\delta_r}}>0\\) and \\(C_{n_{\\delta_r}}<0\\), which corresponds to option A."

          "Step 4: The same rightward force acts above the roll axis (since the vertical tail is usually above the CG). A rightward force above the axis tends to roll the aircraft such that the right wing goes up (positive rolling moment coefficient \\(C_L\\)), so \\(C_L_{\\delta_r}>0\\).",

Ghosh explicitly discussing the signs and physical meaning of C_L_{\\delta_r} and C_N_{\\delta_r}, as well as rudder-induced roll and yaw.

Additional chunks on cross-coupling and stability-control trade-offs were contextually related but not strictly necessary for this simple sign question."
