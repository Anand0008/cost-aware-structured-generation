This force, acting behind the CG, produces a negative yawing moment (nose left), making $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} < 0$. The same side force, if the vertical tail's aerodynamic center is above the aircraft's roll axis (typical for conventional airplanes), creates a positive rolling moment (right wing up/left wing down), making $C_{l_{\\delta_r}} > 0$. This matches option A."

          "Step 2: Analyze the primary effect on yaw. A positive $\\delta_r$ (left deflection) pushes the vertical tail surface to the right, generating a side force (+Y direction) on the tail. This force acts at a distance (lever arm) behind the aircraft's center of gravity, creating a yawing moment that tends to turn the nose to the left. By the right-hand rule, a nose-left yawing moment is negative. Therefore, the yaw control derivative $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} = \\frac{\\partial C_n}{\\partial \\delta_r}$ is negative.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the secondary (cross-coupling) effect on roll. The same side force (+Y) on the vertical tail acts at a point above the aircraft's longitudinal (roll) axis. This vertical offset creates a rolling moment. A rightward force on a point above the roll axis tends to roll the aircraft to the right (right wing up, left wing down). A right-wing-up rolling moment is conventionally positive. Therefore, the roll control derivative due to rudder, $C_{l_{\\delta_r}} = \\frac{\\partial C_l}{\\partial \\delta_r}$, is positive.",
          "Step 4: Combine the findings. For conventional airplanes with a vertical tail mounted above the fuselage, the typical signs are $C_{l_{\\delta_r}} > 0$ and $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} < 0$.",
