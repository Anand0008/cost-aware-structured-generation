C_l_delta_r (roll control derivative) is typically positive for conventional aircraft. When the rudder is deflected (e.g., to the left), it creates a side force on the vertical tail that acts above the aircraft's roll axis, generating a positive rolling moment (right wing up).\n2. C_n_delta_r (yaw control derivative) is typically negative for conventional aircraft. When the rudder is deflected (e.g., to the left), it creates a yawing moment that tends to turn the aircraft's nose to the left (negative yawing moment).\n\nThis is the expected behavior for the primary control functions of the rudder and ailerons in a conventional aircraft design. The other options (B, C, and D) do not correctly represent the typical signs of these key lateral-directional control derivatives."
