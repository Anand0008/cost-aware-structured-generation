Specifically:\n\n**For Profile $Y_I$ (Upper Surface):**\n1.  **Before $x_A$**: Static pressure is at freestream level ($P_{\\infty}$). \n2.  **At $x_A$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the freestream (convex corner). This generates an **expansion fan**, causing static pressure to **decrease** below $P_{\\infty}$.\n3.  **Between $x_A$ and $x_B$**: Pressure remains constant at this lower level.\n4.  **At $x_B$**: The upper surface turns *into* the flow (concave corner). This generates an **oblique shock wave**, causing static pressure to **increase**. Since the pressure rise across a shock is generally stronger than the pressure drop across an expansion for the same turning angle, the pressure after this shock will be *higher* than $P_{\\infty}$.\n5.  **Between $x_B$ and $x_C$**: Pressure remains constant at this higher level.\n6.  **At $x_C$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the flow to align with the freestream.

          "Step 1: **Identify Flow Regime and Airfoil Geometry.** The problem states a supersonic flow ($M > 1$) over a wedge-shaped airfoil. The airfoil has distinct corners at $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$. The task is to determine static pressure profiles along two horizontal lines, $Y_I$ (above the airfoil) and $Y_{II}$ (below the airfoil).",
          "Step 2: **Recall Supersonic Flow Principles.** In supersonic flow, the interaction of the flow with a corner dictates the pressure change:\n    *   When the flow turns *into* a surface (a concave corner), an **oblique shock wave** forms, leading to an *increase* in static pressure.\n    *   When the flow turns *away* from a surface (a convex corner), an **expansion fan** (Prandtl-Meyer expansion) forms, leading to a *decrease* in static pressure.",
          "Step 3: **Analyze Upper Surface ($Y_I$) Flow Turning and Pressure Changes.**\n    *   **Before $x_A$**: Static pressure is the freestream pressure, $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **At $x_A$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the freestream. This is a convex corner, generating an expansion fan. Pressure **decreases** from $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **Between $x_A$ and $x_B$**: The flow is parallel to the first segment; pressure remains constant at a level below $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **At $x_B$**: The upper surface turns *into* the flow. This is a concave corner, generating an oblique shock. Pressure **increases**. Due to the stronger effect of a shock compared to an expansion for the same turning angle, the pressure after this shock will be *higher* than $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **Between $x_B$ and $x_C$**: The flow is parallel to the second segment; pressure remains constant at a level above $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **At $x_C$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the flow to align with the freestream. This is a convex corner, generating an expansion fan. Pressure **decreases** back to $P_{\\infty}$.",
          "Step 4: **Analyze Lower Surface ($Y_{II}$) Flow Turning and Pressure Changes.**\n    *   **Before $x_A$**: Static pressure is $P_{\\infty}$.\n    *   **At $x_A$**: The lower surface turns *into* the freestream.
