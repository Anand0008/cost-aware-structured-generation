        "reasoning": "The wedge is at a small positive angle of attack in a supersonic flow. For such a flat-plate/wedge configuration (Anderson, Ch. 9 and 12), the lower surface turns the flow toward itself, generating an attached oblique shock and a region of higher pressure; the upper surface turns the flow away, generating a Prandtl–Meyer expansion and a region of lower pressure. \n\nLine y = YI lies above the airfoil. Upstream of the leading edge (x < xA), the pressure is the freestream static pressure p∞. Just after the leading edge on the upper side, the expansion fan reduces the pressure to p2 < p∞ and it remains roughly constant over the upper surface until the trailing edge. Downstream of the trailing edge, the flow recombines and asymptotically returns to p∞, so the pressure rises back toward p∞ after xC. Thus, along YI the pressure should drop at xA, stay low between xA and xC, and then rise back toward p∞ after xC.\n\nLine y = YII lies below the airfoil. At xA the lower surface produces an attached oblique shock, so the pressure jumps to a higher value p3 > p∞ and remains roughly constant until the trailing edge. Downstream of the trailing edge, the flow turns back toward the freestream direction through a weak expansion or adjustment region and the pressure returns to p∞. Thus, along YII the pressure should jump up at xA, stay high between xA and xC, and then drop back to p∞ after xC.\n\nAmong the four sets of plots, only option D shows: (1) for YI, a drop in pressure at xA, a low plateau between xA and xC, and a recovery after xC; and (2) for YII, a rise in pressure at xA, a high plateau between xA and xC, and a drop back to freestream after xC. Therefore option D is consistent with the known supersonic wedge pressure behavior and is the correct choice."

          "Step 1: Recognize that the wedge in supersonic flow behaves like a thin airfoil at small angle of attack: the lower surface is a compression surface (oblique shock), and the upper surface is an expansion surface (Prandtl–Meyer fan).",
          "Step 2: Recall that across an attached oblique shock, static pressure increases, while across an expansion fan, static pressure decreases. Downstream of each, the pressure is nearly uniform over the flat surface until the next corner.",
          "Step 3: For the line y = YII (below the airfoil), the flow first encounters the lower leading edge at x = xA, so pressure jumps from p∞ to a higher value p3 and stays roughly constant until the trailing edge. After the trailing edge, the flow turns back toward the freestream direction and the pressure relaxes back to p∞.",
          "Step 4: For the line y = YI (above the airfoil), the flow meets the upper leading edge at x = xA and expands, so pressure drops from p∞ to a lower value p2 and stays nearly constant until the trailing edge. After the trailing edge, the flow recombines and pressure returns to p∞.",
          "Step 5: Compare this qualitative behavior with the four candidate plots: identify which plot shows a pressure drop then plateau then recovery for YI, and a pressure rise then plateau then recovery for YII, all starting at xA and ending near xC.",
