        "reasoning": "The wedge-shaped airfoil (triangular profile) in supersonic flow will generate specific wave patterns: oblique shocks where the surface turns into the flow and expansion fans where it turns away. Assuming a typical orientation with a flat lower surface aligned with the freestream and an inclined upper surface, the flow is undisturbed below the airfoil. Therefore, along a horizontal line below the airfoil (e.g., y = YII), static pressure remains constant at the freestream value. Along a horizontal line above the airfoil (e.g., y = YI), the line intersects an expansion fan emanating from the leading-edge corner (xA), causing a pressure drop, and then an oblique shock from the shoulder corner (xB), causing a pressure rise back to near freestream. The resulting profile shows a step-down then a step-up in pressure. Plot D matches this description, with one constant profile and one with two discontinuities."

          "Step 1: Analyze the geometry from the image description. The wedge-shaped airfoil has corners at xA (leading edge), xB (shoulder/apex), and xC (trailing edge). The flow is supersonic from left to right.",
          "Step 2: Identify the nature of flow turning at each corner. The lower surface from xA to xC is likely flat and aligned with the flow (zero incidence), so no disturbance. The upper surface from xA to xB is inclined, turning the flow away (convex corner), generating an expansion fan at xA. At xB, the surface turns back to horizontal (concave corner), generating an oblique shock.",
          "Step 3: Determine wave angles. The expansion fan and oblique shock emanate from xA and xB at specific Mach angles and deflection angles, creating straight wave boundaries in the flow field.",
          "Step 4: Consider the horizontal lines y = YI and y = YII. Line YI is positioned above the airfoil, intersecting the expansion fan and the oblique shock. Line YII is positioned below the airfoil, remaining entirely in the uniform freestream region.",
          "Step 5: Sketch the pressure profiles. For y = YII: Pressure is constant at p∞ for all x. For y = YI: Pressure is p∞ for x < x_A (upstream of expansion). Upon crossing the expansion fan near x_A, pressure drops to a lower constant value p_low. Upon crossing the oblique shock near x_B, pressure jumps back to approximately p∞ (or slightly higher, but often simplified to p∞ if the flow is turned back exactly to freestream direction) for x > x_B.",
          "Step 6: Match to options. The correct plot (D) shows one profile constant and the other with two discontinuities (drop then rise) at appropriate x-locations."
