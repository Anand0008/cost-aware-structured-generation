        "reasoning": "The core principle for this problem is that if a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system is vibrating *only* in a single normal mode, then its displacement vector at any instant (including initial displacement) must be directly proportional to that mode shape. Given the initial displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [x_1(0); x_2(0)] = [2; 1.24]$ cm and the first mode shape $\\phi_1 = [1; a]^T$, we can set up the proportionality: $\\mathbf{x}(0) = C \\cdot \\phi_1$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality. This leads to the equations: $2 = C \\cdot 1$ and $1.24 = C \\cdot a$. From the first equation, $C = 2$. Substituting $C=2$ into the second equation gives $1.24 = 2a$, which yields $a = 1.24 / 2 = 0.62$. Rounding to two decimal places, $a = 0.62$. This value falls within the correct answer range of 0.61 to 0.63."

          "Step 2: Understand the fundamental principle of normal mode vibration. If a multi-degree-of-freedom system vibrates purely in one of its normal modes, then the displacement vector of the system at any time (including the initial displacement) must be directly proportional to that specific mode shape. This means the ratio of displacements of the individual degrees of freedom will be constant and equal to the ratio of the corresponding components in the mode shape.",
          "Step 3: Formulate the proportionality equation. Let the initial displacement vector be $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [x_1(0); x_2(0)]$. Since the system vibrates in the first mode, $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ must be proportional to $\\phi_1$. Therefore, we can write $\\mathbf{x}(0) = C \\cdot \\phi_1$, where $C$ is a scalar constant.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the given values into the proportionality equation. We have $[2; 1.24] = C \\cdot [1; a]$.",
          "Step 5: Solve the resulting system of equations for $C$ and $a$. From the first component, $2 = C \\cdot 1$, which implies $C = 2$. From the second component, $1.24 = C \\cdot a$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the value of $C$ into the second equation to find $a$. $1.24 = 2 \\cdot a \\implies a = 1.24 / 2 = 0.62$.",
