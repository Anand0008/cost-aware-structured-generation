Given that the system starts vibrating in the first mode, the initial displacements x1(0)=2 cm and x2(0)=1.24 cm must be proportional to the first mode shape φ1=[1 a]^T. Therefore, the ratio x1(0)/x2(0) should equal 1/a. Solving, a = x2(0)/x1(0) = 1.24/2 = 0.62, which rounds to 0.62 (two decimal places). This matches the answer key range of 0.61 to 0.63."
