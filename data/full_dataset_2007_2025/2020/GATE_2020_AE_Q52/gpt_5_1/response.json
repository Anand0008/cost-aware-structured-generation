The first mode shape is given as \\(\\phi_1 = [1\\; a]^T\\). If the system is vibrating only in this mode, the ratio of the physical displacements of the two masses must equal the ratio of the components of the mode shape: \\(x_2/x_1 = a/1 = a\\). The given initial displacements are \\(x_1(0) = 2\\,\\text{cm}\\) and \\(x_2(0) = 1.24\\,\\text{cm}\\). Since the motion starts in the first mode, the initial displacement vector is proportional to \\(\\phi_1\\). Therefore, \\(a = x_2(0)/x_1(0) = 1.24/2 = 0.62\\).

While not addressing this exact numerical question, they reinforced the key idea that in a normal mode all coordinates are proportional to the mode shape, which is central to solving this problem. Specific numerical ratio x2/x1 was obtained using internal reasoning."
