Given the drag polar C_D = 0.025 + 0.049 C_L^2 and sea-level density, we first find the C_L that minimizes power required. Power required P_R is proportional to D V, and with L = W and C_D = C_{D0} + k C_L^2, minimizing P_R with respect to C_L gives the condition C_L = \\sqrt{3 C_{D0} / k}. Substituting C_{D0} = 0.025 and k = 0.049 yields C_L \\approx 1.24. Using the wing loading W/S = 9844 N/m^2 and L = W = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L, we solve for V: V = \\sqrt{2 (W/S) / (\\rho C_L)}. With \\rho = 1.225 kg/m^3 and C_L = 1.24, V \\approx 150 m/s.
