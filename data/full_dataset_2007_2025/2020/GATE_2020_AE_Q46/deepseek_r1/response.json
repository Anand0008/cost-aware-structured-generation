Using the level flight equation L = W = 0.5*ρ*V^2*S*CL and wing loading W/S = 9844 N/m², we solve for V: V = sqrt((W/S) * (2/(ρ*CL_opt))) = sqrt(9844 * (2/(1.225*0.7143))) ≈ sqrt(9844 * 2.2857) ≈ sqrt(22500) = 150.0 m/s.

However, none explicitly derive the condition for maximum range speed for propeller aircraft (max CL/CD). The solution relied on internal knowledge of aircraft performance theory. Chunks were moderately relevant but not exhaustive."
