Maximum range for a propeller aircraft occurs at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio ($C_L/C_D$). For a parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, the maximum $C_L/C_D$ occurs when $C_{D0} = K C_L^2$. Using the given values, $C_{D0} = 0.025$ and $K = 0.049$, we find $C_L = \\sqrt{0.025/0.049} \\approx 0.71428$. Then, using the level flight lift equation $W/S = 0.5 \\rho V^2 C_L$, with $W/S = 9844 \\text{ N/m}^2$ and $\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, we solve for $V$. $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S)}{\\rho C_L}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 9844}{1.225 \\times 0.71428}} \\approx \\sqrt{22500.57} \\approx 150.00 \\text{ m/s}$.
