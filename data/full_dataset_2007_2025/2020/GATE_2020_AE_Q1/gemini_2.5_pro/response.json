Therefore, the condition of continuity on a closed interval $[a,b]$ (assuming $0 \\in [a,b]$) is satisfied.\\n2.  **Differentiability:** We need to check the differentiability of $f(x) = |x|$ on an open interval $(a,b)$ that includes $x=0$.\\n    *   For $x > 0$, $f(x) = x$, so $f'(x) = 1$.\\n    *   For $x < 0$, $f(x) = -x$, so $f'(x) = -1$.\\n    *   At $x = 0$, we evaluate the derivative using the limit definition:\\n        $f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h| - |0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h|}{h}$\\n        The right-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1$.\\n        The left-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h}{h} = -1$.\\n    Since the left-hand derivative ($-1$) is not equal to the right-hand derivative ($1$), the derivative $df/dx$ does not exist at $x=0$. This means $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.\\n\\nSince the Mean Value Theorem requires the function to be differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$, and $f(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$, the theorem is not applicable for any interval $[a,b]$ that contains $x=0$. Option C correctly identifies this violation of the differentiability condition."
