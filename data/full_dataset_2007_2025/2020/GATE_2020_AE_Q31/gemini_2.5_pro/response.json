An aircraft is directionally statically stable if, when disturbed by a sideslip angle ($\\beta$), it generates a restoring yawing moment that tends to reduce $\\beta$ back to zero. This condition is mathematically expressed as a positive derivative of the yawing moment coefficient ($C_N$) with respect to the sideslip angle ($\\beta$), i.e., $C_{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{dC_N}{d\\beta} > 0$.",
          "Step 2: For each airplane (A, B, C), calculate the approximate value of $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ using the given tabulated data. Since the data provides $C_N$ at discrete $\\beta$ values, we can use the finite difference approximation: $C_{N_{\\beta}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C_N}{\\Delta \\beta}$. We can use the change from $\\beta = 0^\\circ$ to $\\beta = 5^\\circ$ for this calculation.",
