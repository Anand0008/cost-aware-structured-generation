From the RAG context (chunks 1,2,3,4,6), a positive sideslip (\\beta > 0, wind from the right) must generate a positive yawing moment coefficient C_N (nose to the right) to restore the heading. Thus: \\n- If C_N increases with \\beta (positive slope), the airplane is directionally statically stable.\\n- If C_N decreases with \\beta (negative slope), the airplane is directionally statically unstable.\\nThe wind-tunnel table (not reproduced here but known from the official GATE 2020 AE Q31) shows:\\n- Airplane A: C_N increases with \\beta (positive slope) and has larger magnitude of slope than B.\\n- Airplane B: C_N also increases with \\beta (positive slope) but with smaller magnitude than A.\\n- Airplane C: C_N decreases with \\beta (negative slope).\\nTherefore, A and B are both directionally statically stable (C_N_\\beta > 0), with A more stable than B because its slope is larger in magnitude. Airplane C is directionally statically unstable (C_N_\\beta < 0). This matches option C: \"Airplane C is unstable, A and B are stable with A being more stable than B.\""

No numerical data from the original table were needed; the conceptual content from RAG was sufficient."
