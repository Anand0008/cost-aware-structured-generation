From beam bending theory, for an upward bending moment, the upper surface of the wing is in compression and the lower surface is in tension. The RAG context (Chunks 1 and 2) explicitly states that under positive high AoA, critical compressive stresses occur in the upper-forward region and critical tensile stresses in the lower-aft region of the wing cross-section. In the given figure, region I is upper-forward, region II is upper-aft, region III is lower-aft, and region IV is lower-forward. Therefore, the region of maximum tension is the lower-aft region, which corresponds to region III. Hence option C is correct and matches the official key."
