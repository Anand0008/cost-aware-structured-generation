        "reasoning": "For a positive high angle of attack (e.g., pull-out from a dive), the wing experiences upward bending. According to bending theory and confirmed by retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 & 2), this causes compressive stresses on the upper surface and tensile stresses on the lower surface. Specifically, the maximum tensile stress occurs in the 'lower-aft' region (lower surface near the trailing edge). From the image description: leading edge left, trailing edge right; Region II is top-right (upper-aft). Assuming a typical quadrant labeling (I: upper-forward, II: upper-aft, III: lower-aft, IV: lower-forward), the lower-aft region corresponds to Region III. Hence, option C is correct."
