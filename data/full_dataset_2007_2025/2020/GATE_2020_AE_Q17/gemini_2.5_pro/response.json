        "reasoning": "The question asks for the region of maximum tension during a 'positive high angle-of-attack condition', which occurs in maneuvers like a steady pull-out. In this condition, the wing experiences significant upward lift, causing it to bend upwards. According to fundamental principles of beam bending and specific knowledge of aircraft wing structures, upward bending induces compressive stresses in the upper fibers (above the neutral axis) and tensile stresses in the lower fibers (below the neutral axis). The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 and 2) explicitly states that for a positive high AoA, critical tensile stresses occur in the 'lower-aft region' of the wing cross-section. Referring to the provided image:\n- Region I: Upper-forward\n- Region II: Upper-aft\n- Region III: Lower-aft\n- Region IV: Lower-forward\nTherefore, Region III, which is the lower-aft section, is where the maximum tension occurs. This matches the correct answer option C."

          "Step 3: Recall the principles of bending stress. When a beam bends upwards, the material on the upper side of its neutral axis experiences compression (fibers shorten), and the material on the lower side experiences tension (fibers lengthen).",
