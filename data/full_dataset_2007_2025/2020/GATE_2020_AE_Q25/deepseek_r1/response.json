Chunk 3 provided general load factor and turn radius formulas, but for level turns, so partially relevant. Chunk 2 discussed gravitational force application, somewhat related. Chunks 5 and 6 were less relevant (example on level turn, round-off error). Overall, RAG supported the solution well, but internal knowledge was used to confirm and derive the specific formula for bottom of vertical circle."
