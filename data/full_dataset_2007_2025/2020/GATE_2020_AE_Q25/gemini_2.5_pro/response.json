        "reasoning": "The problem describes an airplane performing a pull-up maneuver at the bottom of a vertical circle. At this point, the lift force ($L$) acts upwards, and the weight ($W$) acts downwards. The net upward force provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion.\n\n1.  **Convert Speed to SI Units**: The given speed is $V = 360 \\text{ km/h}$. To use it in calculations with meters and seconds, convert it to m/s:\n    $V = 360 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ km}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ h}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 100 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Newton's Second Law**: At the bottom of the vertical circle, the forces acting are the lift force ($L$) upwards and the weight ($W$) downwards. The net force towards the center of the circle (upwards) provides the centripetal force ($F_c$).\n    $F_{\\text{net}} = L - W$\n    The centripetal force is given by $F_c = m a_c = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$, where $m$ is the mass of the airplane, $V$ is its speed, and $R$ is the radius of the circle.\n    Therefore, $L - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$.\n\n3.  **Introduce Load Factor**: The load factor ($n$) is defined as the ratio of lift to weight: $n = \\frac{L}{W}$. From this, we can write $L = nW$.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify**: Substitute $L = nW$ into the force equation:\n    $nW - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Factor out $W$:\n    $(n - 1)W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Since $W = mg$ (where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity), substitute this into the equation:\n    $(n - 1)mg = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Cancel out the mass ($m$) from both sides:\n    $(n - 1)g = \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n\n5.  **Solve for Load Factor ($n$)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for $n$:\n    $n - 1 = \\frac{V^2}{gR}$\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{V^2}{gR}$.\n\n6.  **Substitute Numerical Values**: Given $V = 100 \\text{ m/s}$, $R = 400 \\text{ m}$, and $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$:\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{(100 \\text{ m/s})^2}{(9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2)(400 \\text{ m})}$\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{10000}{3920}$\n    $n = 1 + 2.5510204...$\n    $n = 3.5510204...$\n\n7.  **Round Off**: Rounding off to two decimal places as requested:\n    $n \\approx 3.55$.\n\nThis calculated value of 3.55 falls within the acceptable range of 3.50 to 3.60 provided by the answer key."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Identify Given Data and Target.** The problem provides the aircraft's mass ($m = 5000 \\text{ kg}$), constant speed ($V = 360 \\text{ km/h}$), radius of the vertical circle ($R = 400 \\text{ m}$), and acceleration due to gravity ($g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$). The goal is to find the load factor ($n$) experienced at the center of gravity.",
          "**Step 2: Convert Units.** Ensure all units are consistent. Convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second:\n    $V = 360 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ km}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ h}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 100 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze Forces at the Bottom of the Vertical Circle.** At the bottom of a pull-up maneuver, the lift force ($L$) acts upwards (away from the center of the Earth), and the weight ($W = mg$) acts downwards (towards the center of the Earth). The center of the circular path is above the aircraft.",
          "**Step 4: Apply Newton's Second Law.** The net force acting towards the center of the circular path provides the centripetal force ($F_c$). In this case, the net force is the difference between lift and weight, acting upwards:\n    $L - W = F_c$.",
          "**Step 5: Express Centripetal Force.** The centripetal force required for circular motion is $F_c = m a_c = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$. Substitute this into the force balance equation:\n    $L - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$.",
          "**Step 6: Introduce Load Factor.** The load factor ($n$) is defined as the ratio of the lift force to the aircraft's weight: $n = \\frac{L}{W}$. This implies $L = nW$. Substitute this expression for $L$ into the force equation:\n    $nW - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$.",
          "**Step 7: Solve for Load Factor.** Factor out $W$ from the left side: $(n - 1)W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$. Since $W = mg$, substitute this in: $(n - 1)mg = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$. The mass ($m$) cancels out from both sides, simplifying the equation to: $(n - 1)g = \\frac{V^2}{R}$. Finally, solve for $n$: $n = 1 + \\frac{V^2}{gR}$.",
          "**Step 8: Calculate and Round Off.** Substitute the numerical values into the derived formula:\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{(100 \\text{ m/s})^2}{(9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2)(400 \\text{ m})} = 1 + \\frac{10000}{3920} = 1 + 2.5510204... = 3.5510204...$.\n    Rounding off to two decimal places, the load factor is $3.55$."

Apply Newton's second law in the vertical direction ($L - W = m a_c$), substitute the centripetal acceleration $a_c = \\frac{V^2}{R}$ and weight $W = mg$, and then use the definition of load factor $n = \\frac{L}{W}$ to derive the formula step-by-step.",
