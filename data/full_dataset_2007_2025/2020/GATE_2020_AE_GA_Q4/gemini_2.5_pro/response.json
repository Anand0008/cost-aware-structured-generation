        "reasoning": "The question text explicitly states the core of the complaint: 'formal in-flight announcements in English lasting 15 seconds, as opposed to informal 5 second messages in French.' This directly indicates that the French-speaking couple was upset by the disparity in the length and formality of the announcements, implying unequal importance. Option C, 'the English announcements being longer than the French ones,' directly captures this specific grievance. Options A and B are not supported by the text as the primary cause of upset, and Option D is the opposite of the couple's concern."

          "Step 6: Analyze Option C: 'the English announcements being longer than the French ones.' This statement directly reflects the '15 seconds' vs '5 seconds' disparity mentioned in the text, which is the specific reason for the couple's dissatisfaction.",
          "Step 7: Analyze Option D: 'equal importance being given to English and French.' This is contrary to the situation described; the couple was upset precisely because equal importance was *not* given.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that Option C is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided in the passage."
