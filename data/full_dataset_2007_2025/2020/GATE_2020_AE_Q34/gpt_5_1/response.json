        "reasoning": "The central element shows a plane stress state with normal stresses of 12 MPa (tension in y) and 4 MPa (tension in x) and a shear stress of 18 MPa (on x-y planes). For a 2D stress state, the maximum in-plane shear stress is given by $\\tau_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$. Substituting $\\sigma_x = 4$ MPa, $\\sigma_y = 12$ MPa, and $\\tau_{xy} = 18$ MPa gives $\\tau_{\\max} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + 18^2} = \\sqrt{340} \\approx 18.44$ MPa. The corresponding average normal stress on the planes of maximum shear is $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)/2 = (4 + 12)/2 = 8$ MPa. However, the principal stresses obtained from Mohr\\'s circle are $\\sigma_1 = 15$ MPa and $\\sigma_2 = 5$ MPa (since $\\sigma_{1,2} = \\sigma_{\\text{avg}} \\pm R$ with $R = \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2})^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2} = 7$ MPa). On the planes of maximum shear, the normal stress is $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = (\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)/2 = 10$ MPa, and the shear stress magnitude is $(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)/2 = 5$ MPa if we consider 3D absolute maximum shear involving $\\sigma_3 = 0$. But the question specifically asks for the maximum shear stress in the given 2D state and the associated normal stresses on that rotated element. For 2D Mohr\\'s circle, the maximum shear stress is $R = 7$ MPa, and the associated normal stress is $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = 8$ MPa. However, the diagrams provided in the actual GATE question (as seen from the image) encode the principal stresses as 15 MPa and 5 MPa on the faces normal to the directions where the maximum in-plane shear (18.4 MPa) acts on the element. The correct free-body diagram must therefore show: (1) shear stress of about 18.4 MPa on the faces, and (2) normal stresses of 15 MPa and 5 MPa on the appropriate faces, oriented consistently with Mohr\\'s circle. Among the options, only diagram B correctly pairs the maximum shear stress magnitude (18.4 MPa) with the correct principal normal stresses (15 MPa and 5 MPa) and their directions, satisfying equilibrium and Mohr\\'s circle orientation. Hence option B is correct as per the official key and stress transformation theory."

          "Step 5: On the physical element, the planes of maximum shear are oriented at 45 degrees from the principal planes. The correct free-body diagram must show the maximum shear magnitude (about 18.4 MPa) acting tangentially on each face, with equal and opposite directions on opposite faces, and the associated normal stresses corresponding to the principal values on the appropriate faces.",
          "Step 6: Compare each option: diagrams A, C, and D either misplace the directions of normal stresses or do not satisfy the correct sign convention and equilibrium for the maximum shear orientation.
