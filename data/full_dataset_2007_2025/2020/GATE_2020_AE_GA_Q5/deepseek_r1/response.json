The inequality e^x e^y >= e^x + e^y is equivalent to (e^x - 1)(e^y - 1) >= 1. Since x,y > 1, e^x > e and e^y > e, so (e^x-1)(e^y-1) > (e-1)^2 > 1, satisfying the condition.

          "Step 3: Rearrange inequality: e^x e^y >= e^x + e_y => divide by e^x e^y (positive): 1 >= e^{-y} + e^{-x} => e^{-x} + e^{-y} <= 1. For x,y > 1, e^{-x} and e^{-y} are less than e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, so their sum is less than 0.7358 < 1. Thus inequality holds. Alternatively, use equivalent form (e^x-1)(e^y-1) >= 1.",
          "Step 4: Test option B: f(x)=√x. For positive x,y, √(x+y) <= √x + √y (by concavity of square root). Hence subadditive, not superadditive.",
          "Step 5: Test option C: f(x)=1/x. For positive x,y, 1/(x+y) < 1/x + 1/y because (1/x + 1/y) - 1/(x+y) = (x+y)/(xy) - 1/(x+y) = ((x+y)^2 - xy)/(xy(x+y)) > 0. Thus subadditive.",
          "Step 6: Test option D: f(x)=e^{-x}. For x,y > 1, e^{-x} and e^{-y} are small. Check e^{-(x+y)} >= e^{-x} + e^{-y}. This is false because left side is very small (product) while right side is sum of two positive numbers. For example, take x=y=2: e^{-4} ≈ 0.0183, e^{-2}+e^{-2} ≈ 0.2707. Inequality fails."
