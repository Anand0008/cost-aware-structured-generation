        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the area of the shaded portion, which is the area of the circle minus the area of the inscribed rectangle. The key is to recognize that a rectangle inscribed in a circle has the maximum possible area when it is a square. If the radius of the circle is 'a', then the diameter is '2a'. This diameter is also the diagonal of the inscribed square. Let the side length of the square be 's'. By the Pythagorean theorem, $s^2 + s^2 = (2a)^2$, which simplifies to $2s^2 = 4a^2$, so $s^2 = 2a^2$. The area of the square is $s^2 = 2a^2$. The area of the circle is $\\pi a^2$. Therefore, the area of the shaded portion is $\\pi a^2 - 2a^2$."
