The actual heat absorbed is the increase in the total enthalpy rate of the air passing through the combustor. The total ideal heat released by the fuel is calculated by multiplying the mass flow rate of the fuel by its lower heating value. The mass flow rate of the fuel is derived from the given mass flow rate of air and the air-to-fuel ratio. All calculations lead to an efficiency of approximately 91.65%, which falls within the specified range of 91 to 93."
