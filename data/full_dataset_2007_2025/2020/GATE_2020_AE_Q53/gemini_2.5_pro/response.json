        "reasoning": "The problem describes a statically indeterminate beam, specifically a propped cantilever (fixed at one end, simply supported at the other) subjected to a uniformly distributed load (UDL) over its entire length. To solve for the reaction force at the simply supported end, the principle of superposition combined with a compatibility condition is used.\n\n1.  **Identify the redundant support:** The beam has a fixed support (which provides a vertical reaction and a moment) and a simple support (which provides a vertical reaction). With three unknown reactions and only two equilibrium equations (sum of vertical forces and sum of moments), the beam is statically indeterminate to the first degree. We choose the reaction at the simply supported end, let's call it $R_B$, as the redundant force.\n\n2.  **Create a determinate primary structure:** Remove the redundant simple support, transforming the beam into a determinate cantilever beam (fixed at the left end, free at the right end) subjected to the given UDL.\n\n3.  **Calculate deflection due to UDL on the cantilever:** The downward deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam of length $L$ subjected to a uniformly distributed load $q$ over its entire length is given by:\n    $\\delta_{q} = \\frac{qL^4}{8EI}$\n    Given: $q = 10 \\text{ N/m}$, $L = 1 \\text{ m}$.\n    $\\delta_{q} = \\frac{10 \\times (1)^4}{8EI} = \\frac{10}{8EI}$ (downward)\n\n4.  **Calculate deflection due to the redundant force on the cantilever:** The upward deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam of length $L$ due to an upward point load $R_B$ (the redundant reaction) at its free end is given by:\n    $\\delta_{R_B} = \\frac{R_B L^3}{3EI}$\n    Given: $L = 1 \\text{ m}$.\n    $\\delta_{R_B} = \\frac{R_B \\times (1)^3}{3EI} = \\frac{R_B}{3EI}$ (upward)\n\n5.  **Apply the compatibility condition:** Since the simply supported end does not allow vertical deflection, the net deflection at that point must be zero. Therefore, the downward deflection due to the UDL must be equal to the upward deflection due to the redundant reaction:\n    $\\delta_{q} = \\delta_{R_B}$\n    $\\frac{10}{8EI} = \\frac{R_B}{3EI}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $R_B$:**\n    $\\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{R_B}{3}$\n    $R_B = \\frac{10 \\times 3}{8} = \\frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \\text{ N}$\n\nThe magnitude of the normal reaction force at the simply supported end is $3.75 \\text{ N}$.

While it didn't directly address a propped cantilever, the underlying principles and component formulas for cantilever deflection due to UDL and point load were implicitly available, allowing the model to apply them to this problem. The specific formula for a propped cantilever reaction was not explicitly present in the RAG."
