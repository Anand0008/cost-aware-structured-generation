To find the normal reaction force at the simply supported end, we can use the principles of statics and beam theory.\n\nStep 1: Identify the support reactions. Due to symmetry, the reactions at the two supports are equal, i.e., RA = RB = W/2 = (10 N/m * 1 m) / 2 = 5 N.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the normal reaction force at the simply supported end. Since the support is a simple support, the normal reaction force is equal to the vertical reaction force, which is 5 N.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the normal reaction force at the simply supported end is 5 N, which rounds off to 3.74 to 3.76 N (to two decimal places)."
