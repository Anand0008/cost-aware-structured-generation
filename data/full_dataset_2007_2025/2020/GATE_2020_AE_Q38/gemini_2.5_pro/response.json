          "Step 1: Understand the Principle - The problem requires calculating drag using the momentum integral equation applied to a control volume enclosing the airfoil. This method relates the drag force to the momentum deficit in the wake.",
          "Step 2: Define Control Volume and Assumptions - Consider a 2D control volume with its inlet at section A (far upstream, uniform flow $U_0$) and its outlet at section B (far downstream, where the wake is observed). The problem states that the static pressure at sections A and B is the same ($P_A = P_B$), which simplifies the momentum equation by eliminating pressure terms. The flow is low speed, implying incompressible flow.",
          "Step 3: Apply Momentum Equation for Drag - For steady, incompressible flow with uniform pressure far upstream and downstream, the drag force $D$ per unit span on the airfoil is given by the momentum deficit in the wake: $D = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho u(y) (U_0 - u(y)) dy$, where $u(y)$ is the velocity profile at the downstream section B, and $U_0$ is the freestream velocity.",
          "Step 4: Substitute Velocity Profile - From the provided image, the velocity profile at section B is: $u(y) = U_0$ for $|y| > c/2$ (outside the wake) and $u(y) = 0.995 U_0$ for $-c/2 \\le y \\le c/2$ (inside the wake, with a total height of $c$).",
          "Step 5: Integrate to Find Drag Force - The integral only has a non-zero contribution within the wake region. Substitute the wake velocity into the momentum integral:\n$D = \\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} \\rho (0.995 U_0) (U_0 - 0.995 U_0) dy$\n$D = \\rho (0.995 U_0) (0.005 U_0) \\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} dy$\n$D = \\rho (0.995 U_0) (0.005 U_0) (c/2 - (-c/2))$\n$D = \\rho (0.995 U_0) (0.005 U_0) c$\n$D = \\rho U_0^2 (0.004975) c$",
          "Step 6: Calculate Drag Coefficient - The 2D drag coefficient $C_D$ is defined as $C_D = \\frac{D}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_0^2 c}$. Substitute the expression for $D$:\n$C_D = \\frac{\\rho U_0^2 (0.004975) c}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_0^2 c}$\n$C_D = 2 \\times 0.004975 = 0.00995$",
