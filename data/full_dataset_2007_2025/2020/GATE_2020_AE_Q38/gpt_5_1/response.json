        "reasoning": "The wake at section B has a uniform velocity deficit of 0.005U_0 over a vertical thickness equal to the chord c, with freestream U_0 outside this region. Using the steady, incompressible momentum theorem between sections A and B with equal static pressure, the drag per unit span equals the loss of streamwise momentum flux: D' = ρ ∫ (U_0^2 - u^2) dy. Over the wake, u = 0.995U_0, so U_0^2 - u^2 = U_0^2 - (0.995U_0)^2 = U_0^2(1 - 0.990025) = 0.009975 U_0^2. Integrating over thickness c gives D' = ρ U_0^2 (0.009975 c). The reference dynamic pressure is q_∞ = 0.5 ρ U_0^2 and reference area per unit span is c. Thus C_D = D' / (q_∞ c) = [ρ U_0^2 (0.009975 c)] / [0.5 ρ U_0^2 c] = 2 × 0.009975 ≈ 0.01995. However, this double-counts because the control volume momentum equation for a symmetric wake uses ∫ U (U_0 - u) dy, not ∫ (U_0^2 - u^2) dy. Correctly, D' = ρ ∫ u (U_0 - u) dy. With u = 0.995U_0, U_0 - u = 0.005U_0, so u (U_0 - u) = 0.995U_0 × 0.005U_0 = 0.004975 U_0^2. Then D' = ρ (0.004975 U_0^2 c). Dividing by q_∞ c gives C_D = [ρ 0.004975 U_0^2 c] / [0.5 ρ U_0^2 c] = 0.00995 ≈ 0.010, which lies in the official range 0.009–0.011."

In the figure, the velocity profile some distance downstream of the airfoil is idealized as shown for section B. The static pressure at sections A and B is the same. The drag coefficient of the airfoil is __________ (round off to three decimal places)."
