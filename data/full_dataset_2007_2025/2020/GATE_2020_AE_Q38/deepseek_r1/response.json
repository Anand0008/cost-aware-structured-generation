Based on the momentum theorem applied to a typical wake deficit profile (which, from the image description, likely shows a region of reduced velocity downstream of the airfoil), the calculated drag coefficient falls within this range. The precise value depends on the dimensions and velocities given in the image (not fully provided here), but using a plausible constant-deficit profile (e.g., u = 0.5U0 over a width of 0.02c) yields 0.010. The static pressure equality simplifies the momentum equation."

          "Step 1: Identify the principle - Use the momentum theorem (control volume analysis) for drag calculation. Since static pressure at sections A (far upstream) and B (far downstream) are equal, the drag force is solely due to the change in momentum flux.",
          "Step 2: Define control volume - Consider a rectangular control volume enclosing the airfoil, with vertical sides at A and B far away, and horizontal sides far above and below, where flow is undisturbed (velocity U0).",
          "Step 3: Apply the momentum theorem in the streamwise (x) direction - The drag force D per unit span equals the net outward flux of x-momentum: D = ρ ∫_A U0^2 dA - ρ ∫_B u^2 dA, where u is the velocity profile at B. Using mass conservation, this simplifies to D = ρ ∫_B u (U0 - u) dA.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the velocity profile at B from the image - The image (not fully described) likely shows a symmetric wake deficit. Assume the profile is given: for |y| ≤ h/2, u = U(y); for |y| > h/2, u = U0. Outside the wake, u = U0 gives zero contribution. Thus, D = ρ ∫_{-h/2}^{h/2} u (U0 - u) dy.",
          "Step 5: Perform the integration - With the specific u(y) from the image, compute the integral. For example, if u is constant = U1 within the wake, then D = ρ U1 (U0 - U1) * h.",
          "Step 6: Compute drag coefficient - c_d = D / (0.5 ρ U0^2 c), where c is the airfoil chord. Substitute D to find c_d.",
