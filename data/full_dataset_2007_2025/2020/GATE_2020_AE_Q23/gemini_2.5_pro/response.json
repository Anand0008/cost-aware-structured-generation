        "reasoning": "The stagnation temperature rise across an axial compressor rotor is directly related to the work done on the fluid, which can be calculated using Euler's turbomachinery equation. Given no pre-whirl ($C_{\\theta1} = 0$), the work done per unit mass ($W_c$) is $U C_{\\theta2}$. This work is also equal to $C_p \\Delta T_{st}$. Equating these, we get $\\Delta T_{st} = \\frac{U C_{\\theta2}}{C_p}$. Substituting the given values: $U = 200$ m/s, $C_{\\theta2} = 150$ m/s, and $C_p = 1005$ J/(kg K), we get $\\Delta T_{st} = \\frac{200 \\times 150}{1005} = \\frac{30000}{1005} \\approx 29.8507$ K.
