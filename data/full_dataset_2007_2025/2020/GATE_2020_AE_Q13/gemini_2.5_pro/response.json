        "reasoning": "A centrifugal compressor's primary function is to increase the pressure of the working fluid. The rotating impeller is the component responsible for imparting energy to the fluid. This energy addition, primarily in the form of kinetic energy and some static pressure rise, leads to an increase in the total (stagnation) enthalpy of the fluid. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics for a control volume, work input to the compressor increases the stagnation enthalpy, which in turn increases the stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure. Therefore, the exit stagnation pressure ($P_{02}$) will always be greater than the inlet stagnation pressure ($P_{01}$) across the impeller, regardless of whether the exit is open or closed (as long as the impeller is rotating and doing work). The 'closed exit' condition might affect the mass flow rate and efficiency, potentially leading to surge, but the fundamental energy addition by the rotating impeller still results in a pressure rise."

          "Step 3: Relate energy addition to stagnation properties. When work is done on a fluid, its total energy, represented by stagnation enthalpy, increases. For a gas, an increase in stagnation enthalpy directly corresponds to an increase in stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure.",
          "Step 4: Consider the effect of a 'closed exit'. Even with a closed exit, the impeller is still rotating and continuously imparting energy to the fluid within its passages. This energy input will still cause the stagnation pressure of the fluid to rise from the inlet to the exit of the impeller.",
          "Step 5: Conclude the pressure ratio. Since energy is continuously added by the rotating impeller, the stagnation pressure at the exit of the impeller ($P_{02}$) must be greater than the stagnation pressure at the inlet ($P_{01}$). Thus, the ratio $P_{02}/P_{01}$ must be greater than 1."
