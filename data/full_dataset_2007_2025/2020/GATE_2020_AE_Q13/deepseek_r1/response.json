This is true even under closed exit (zero mass flow) conditions, where the fluid is subjected to centrifugal forces, creating a radial pressure gradient. The stagnation pressure at the impeller exit will always be greater than at the inlet for a functioning compressor. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1) mentions a typical single-stage pressure ratio of 4:1, and Chunk 6 provides formulas showing the stagnation pressure ratio is >1. Thus, the ratio is greater than 1."
