This is because the impeller imparts kinetic energy to the fluid, causing an increase in the stagnation pressure. The impeller's rotational speed and blade design are the primary factors that determine the pressure rise across the impeller. As the air flows through the impeller, its static pressure increases due to the conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, resulting in a stagnation pressure ratio greater than 1."
