    "question_text": "The thickness of a laminar boundary layer (δ) over a flat plate is, delta/x = 5.2/sqrt(Rex), where x is measured from the leading edge along the length of the plate. The velocity profile within the boundary layer is idealized as varying linearly with y. For freestream velocity of 3 m/s and kinematic viscosity of 1.5×10^-5 m^2/s, the displacement thickness at 0.5 m from the leading edge is __________ mm (round off to two decimal places)."
