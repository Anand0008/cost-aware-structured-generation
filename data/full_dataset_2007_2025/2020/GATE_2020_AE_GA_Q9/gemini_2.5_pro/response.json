Comparing with the given equation, we have `$A = a$`, `$B = -b$`, and `$C = c$`. Therefore,\n    `$(-b)^2 - 4(a)(c) = 0$`\n    `$b^2 - 4ac = 0$`\n    `$b^2 = 4ac$` (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Value of the Equal Root**: When the roots are equal, the single root `β` is given by `$x = -B / (2A)$`.\n    `$\\beta = -(-b) / (2a)$`\n    `$\\beta = b / (2a)$` (Equation 2)\n\n3.  **Expressing coefficients in terms of `a` and `β`**: From Equation 2, we can write `b` in terms of `a` and `β`:\n    `$b = 2a\\beta$` (Equation 3)\n    Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:\n    `$(2a\\beta)^2 = 4ac$`\n    `$4a^2\\beta^2 = 4ac$`\n    Assuming `$a \\neq 0$` (for it to be a quadratic equation), we can divide by `$4a$`:\n    `$a\\beta^2 = c$` (Equation 4)\n\n4.  **Checking the Options**: Now, we substitute the expressions for `b` (Equation 3) and `c` (Equation 4) into the given options.\n    *   **Option A**: `$\\beta = b/a$`. From Equation 2, `$\\beta = b/(2a)$`. So, Option A is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B**: `$\\beta^2 = ac$`. From Equation 4, `$\\beta^2 = c/a$`. So, Option B is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C**: `$\\beta^3 = bc / (2a^2)$`.\n        Substitute `b = 2aβ` and `c = aβ^2` into the right-hand side:\n        `$bc / (2a^2) = (2a\\beta)(a\\beta^2) / (2a^2)$`\n        `$= (2a^2\\beta^3) / (2a^2)$`\n        `$= \\beta^3$`\n        This matches the left-hand side `$\\beta^3$`. So, Option C is correct.\n    *   **Option D**: `$b^2 \\neq 4ac$`. This contradicts Equation 1, which states `$b^2 = 4ac$` for equal roots. So, Option D is incorrect."
