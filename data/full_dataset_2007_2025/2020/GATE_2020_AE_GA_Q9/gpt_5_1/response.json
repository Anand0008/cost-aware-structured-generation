With equal roots, the quadratic can be written as $a(x - \\beta)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow ax^2 - 2a\\beta x + a\\beta^2 = 0$. Comparing coefficients with $ax^2 - bx + c = 0$ gives $-2a\\beta = -b$ and $a\\beta^2 = c$. Hence $\\beta = \\frac{b}{2a}$ and $\\beta^2 = \\frac{c}{a}$. Eliminating $\\beta$ between these: $\\beta^2 = \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$. Using $b^2 = 4ac$, we get $\\beta^2 = \\frac{4ac}{4a^2} = \\frac{c}{a}$ (consistent). Then $\\beta^3 = \\beta\\beta^2 = \\frac{b}{2a} \\cdot \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{bc}{2a^2}$, which matches option C. Options A and B are incorrect by a factor of 2 or missing the relation, and D contradicts the equal-roots condition."
