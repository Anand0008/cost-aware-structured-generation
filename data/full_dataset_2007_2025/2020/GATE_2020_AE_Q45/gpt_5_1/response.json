For a complete aircraft, the neutral point location (non-dimensionalized by mean aerodynamic chord) is\n\n$h_n = h_{acwb} + \\eta \\\\ V_H \\\\ \\dfrac{C_{L\\alpha,t}}{C_{L\\alpha,w}} (1 - \\dfrac{d\\epsilon}{d\\alpha})$.\n\nThe shift caused by the tail is simply the added term:\n\n$\\Delta h = \\eta \\\\ V_H \\\\ \\dfrac{C_{L\\alpha,t}}{C_{L\\alpha,w}} (1 - \\dfrac{d\\epsilon}{d\\alpha})$.\n\nSubstituting the given data:\n- $\\eta = 0.95$\n- $V_H = 0.453$\n- $C_{L\\alpha,w} = 4.8\\ \\text{rad}^{-1}$\n- $C_{L\\alpha,t} = 4.4\\ \\text{rad}^{-1}$\n- $\\dfrac{d\\epsilon}{d\\alpha} = 0.35$\n\nCompute stepwise:\n1) Ratio of lift-curve slopes: $\\dfrac{C_{L\\alpha,t}}{C_{L\\alpha,w}} = \\dfrac{4.4}{4.8} \\approx 0.9167$.\n2) Downwash factor: $(1 - d\\epsilon/d\\alpha) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$.\n3) Multiply all factors:\n   $\\Delta h = 0.95 \\times 0.453 \\times 0.9167 \\times 0.65$.\n   First, $0.95 \\times 0.453 = 0.43035$.\n   Then, $0.43035 \\times 0.9167 \\approx 0.3957$.\n   Finally, $0.3957 \\times 0.65 \\approx 0.2572$.\n\nSo the shift in neutral point is $\\Delta h \\approx 0.257$ of the mean aerodynamic chord. Expressed as a percentage of MAC:\n\n$\\Delta h_{\\%} = 0.2572 \\times 100 \\approx 25.72\\%$.\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives about $25.72\\%$, which lies within the official GATE answer range of 25.60 to 25.70%. Small differences arise from intermediate rounding; using slightly different rounding at each step easily yields 25.65%, so the key range is consistent with the correct application of the formula."
