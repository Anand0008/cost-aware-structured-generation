        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent context for the neutral point formula (Chunks 1, 4, 6), tail volume ratio (Chunk 2), and downwash gradient (Chunk 3). Crucially, Chunk 3's explicit mention of 'eta_h' (tail efficiency factor) in the context of `Cm_alpha_tail` was vital for confirming its inclusion in the neutral point shift calculation, as the `h_n` formulas in Chunks 1, 4, and 6 did not explicitly show `eta_h`. This required synthesizing information from multiple chunks to arrive at the complete formula."
