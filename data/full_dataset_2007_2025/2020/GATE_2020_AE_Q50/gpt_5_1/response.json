For a rocket nozzle, the characteristic velocity is defined as c^* = p_c A_t / \\dot{m}, so the mass flow rate is \\dot{m} = p_c A_t / c^*. Converting pressure: p_c = 50 bar = 50 \\times 10^5 Pa = 5.0 \\times 10^6 Pa. Thus \\dot{m} = (5.0 \\times 10^6 Pa \\times 0.005 m^2) / 1900 m/s = 25,000 / 1900 kg/s \\approx 13.1579 kg/s.
