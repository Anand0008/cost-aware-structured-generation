        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the exit velocity of an ideal ramjet engine. Given the stagnation temperature at the combustor exit ($T_{02}$), the specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), and the gas constant ($R$), the calculation of exit velocity ($V_{exit}$) requires either the exit Mach number ($M_{exit}$) or the static temperature at the exit ($T_{exit}$). Since the problem provides the 'design flight Mach number' ($M_0 = 2.8$) but no information about the ambient pressure or the pressure ratio across the nozzle, a standard and necessary assumption for an ideal ramjet operating at its design point is that the flow expands to the flight Mach number at the nozzle exit, i.e., $M_{exit} = M_0 = 2.8$. \n\nUsing this assumption, we can calculate the static temperature at the nozzle exit ($T_{exit}$) from the stagnation temperature ($T_{02}$) using the isentropic flow relation: \n$T_{exit} = T_{02} / (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{exit}^2)$ \n$T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} (2.8)^2)$ \n$T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + 0.2 \\times 7.84)$ \n$T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + 1.568)$ \n$T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / 2.568 \\approx 934.509 \\text{ K}$\n\nNext, calculate the speed of sound at the exit ($a_{exit}$): \n$a_{exit} = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_{exit}}$ \n$a_{exit} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J/(kg K)} \\times 934.509 \\text{ K}}$ \n$a_{exit} = \\sqrt{375354.0} \\approx 612.66 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nFinally, calculate the exit velocity ($V_{exit}$): \n$V_{exit} = M_{exit} \\times a_{exit}$ \n$V_{exit} = 2.8 \\times 612.66 \\text{ m/s} \\approx 1715.448 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 1715.4 m/s falls within the specified correct answer range of 1712.0 to 1719.0 m/s."
