The tangential component is found by projecting the burnout velocity onto the horizontal direction: $V_t = V_b \\cos(\\theta)$. With $V_b = 13.5$ km/s and $\\theta = 5^\\circ$, $V_t = 13.5 \\times \\cos(5^\\circ) \\approx 13.5 \\times 0.9961947 \\approx 13.4486$ km/s. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 13.45 km/s, which lies within the official answer range of 13.42 to 13.47 km/s. This aligns with orbital mechanics where the circular orbit speed at a given radius equals the horizontal component of the burnout velocity if the orbit is to be circular at that instant."
