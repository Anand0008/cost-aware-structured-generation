Calculate the true airspeed (TAS) using the given Mach number and temperature at 4 km altitude.\n2. Calculate the equivalent airspeed (EAS) using the dynamic pressure formula and the sea-level air density.\n3. Divide the EAS by the TAS to get the ratio.\n\nThe key steps are:\n- TAS = Mach * Speed of sound at 4 km altitude\n- EAS = sqrt(2 * dynamic pressure / sea-level air density)\n- Ratio of EAS to TAS = EAS / TAS\n\nPlugging in the given values, the ratio comes out to be between 0.80 and 0.84, which matches the correct answer."
