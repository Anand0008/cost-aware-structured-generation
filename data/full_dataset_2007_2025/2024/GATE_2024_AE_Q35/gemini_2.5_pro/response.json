        "reasoning": "The question asks for the lift coefficient of a NACA 0012 airfoil using thin airfoil theory. NACA 0012 is a symmetric airfoil. According to thin airfoil theory, for a symmetric airfoil, the lift coefficient ($c_l$) is given by the formula $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle of attack in radians. Given $\\alpha = 5$ degrees, we first convert it to radians: $\\alpha_{rad} = 5 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{36}$ radians. Plugging this into the formula: $c_l = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\pi}{36} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{36} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{18}$. Calculating the numerical value: $c_l \\approx \\frac{(3.14159)^2}{18} \\approx \\frac{9.8696}{18} \\approx 0.5483$. Rounded off to two decimal places, $c_l = 0.55$.
