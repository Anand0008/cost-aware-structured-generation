From continuity ($\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$), if $\\dot{m}$ is constant and $\\rho$ tends to increase due to higher compression, $V_x$ decreases relative to design ($V_x < V_{x,design}$). From velocity triangle analysis (RAG Chunks 2 & 3), lower $V_x$ causes the relative velocity vector $C_2$ at rotor inlet to swing towards the pressure surface, creating a positive incidence angle ($\\beta_{actual} > \\beta_{blade}$), leading to potential flow separation on the pressure side. Statement C is TRUE: The same condition (increased RPM at constant $\\dot{m}$) causes positive incidence and stalling in front stages. If severe, this can lead to compressor surge, a system-wide instability. Statement B is FALSE: Increasing mass flow at constant RPM increases $V_x$ ($V_x > V_{x,design}$), causing $C_2$ to swing towards the suction surface (negative incidence), not positive. Statement D is FALSE: Increasing mass flow at constant RPM moves the operating point away from the surge line on the compressor map, reducing surge risk."

          "Step 3: For Statement A: Constant $\\dot{m}$, increased RPM ($U$ increases). Higher $U$ tends to increase pressure ratio, thus $\\rho$ increases downstream. To keep $\\dot{m}$ constant, $V_x$ must decrease. Lower $V_x$ than design causes the relative flow angle at rotor inlet ($\\beta_2$) to increase relative to blade angle (positive incidence). This can cause flow separation on the pressure side (stall). So A is TRUE.",
          "Step 4: For Statement B: Constant RPM ($U$ fixed), increased $\\dot{m}$. Assuming area $A$ fixed, $V_x$ increases. Higher $V_x$ than design causes $\\beta_2$ to decrease (negative incidence), leading to suction side separation. This is not positive incidence. So B is FALSE.",
          "Step 5: For Statement C: Same condition as A (constant $\\dot{m}$, increased RPM). Positive incidence and stalling in early stages can lead to a breakdown of pressure rise, potentially triggering surge (a global instability where flow reverses). So C is TRUE.",
          "Step 6: For Statement D: Constant RPM, increased $\\dot{m}$. This moves the operating point to a higher flow rate on the compressor characteristic, typically away from the surge line (which is at low flow). Surge risk decreases. So D is FALSE."
