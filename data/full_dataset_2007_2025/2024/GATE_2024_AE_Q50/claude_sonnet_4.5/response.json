Increasing the blade RPM (while keeping mass flow rate constant) will cause the relative velocity vector 'C2' to swing towards the suction side of the rotor blade, leading to negative incidence and flow separation on the suction side. This is a true statement.\n\nC. Increasing the blade RPM (while keeping mass flow rate constant) will also increase the pressure rise across the compressor stage. This can push the compressor closer to the surge line, potentially causing surge. This is also a true statement.\n\nB and D are not correct, as increasing the mass flow rate (at constant RPM) would cause the relative velocity vector 'C2' to swing towards the pressure side, leading to positive incidence and flow separation on the pressure side, rather than the suction side. Additionally, increasing mass flow rate does not directly cause surge - it is the increased pressure rise that can push the compressor towards surge."
