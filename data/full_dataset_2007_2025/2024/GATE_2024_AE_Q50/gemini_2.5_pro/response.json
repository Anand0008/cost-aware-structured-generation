        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the TRUE statements for a single-stage axial compressor under off-design conditions.\n\n**Option A Analysis:** \"Starting from design condition and keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)\"\n*   **Given:** Mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is constant, Blade RPM (and thus blade speed $U$) is increased.\n*   **Effect on Axial Velocity ($V_x$):** Since $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$, if $\\dot{m}$ is constant and the flow area $A$ is fixed, the axial velocity $V_x$ remains relatively constant (assuming density $\\rho$ changes are secondary or compensated at the rotor inlet).\n*   **Effect on Velocity Triangle:** Consider the rotor inlet velocity triangle where the relative velocity $\\vec{w}$ is given by $\\vec{w} = \\vec{V} - \\vec{U}$. The absolute velocity $\\vec{V}$ from the stator has components $V_x$ and $V_{\\theta}$. The relative flow angle $\\beta$ is given by $\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$.\n*   **Incidence Change:** If $U$ increases while $V_x$ remains constant, the term $(U - V_{\\theta})$ increases. This leads to an increase in $\\tan(\\beta)$, and thus an increase in $\\beta$. An actual relative flow angle $\\beta$ that is greater than the design blade angle is defined as *positive incidence*. Positive incidence causes the flow to impinge on the pressure surface of the blade, leading to flow separation (stall) on the pressure side. Therefore, Statement A is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option B Analysis:** \"Starting from design condition at the same blade RPM, if the mass flow rate is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)\"\n*   **Given:** Blade RPM ($U$) is constant, Mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is increased.\n*   **Effect on Axial Velocity ($V_x$):** If $\\dot{m}$ increases and $A$ is fixed, the axial velocity $V_x$ must increase (as $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$).\n*   **Incidence Change:** With $U$ constant and $V_x$ increasing, the term $\\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$ decreases, leading to a decrease in $\\tan(\\beta)$, and thus a decrease in $\\beta$. An actual relative flow angle $\\beta$ that is less than the design blade angle is defined as *negative incidence*. Negative incidence causes the flow to impinge on the suction surface of the blade, leading to flow separation (stall) on the suction side. The statement claims *positive incidence*, which is incorrect. Therefore, Statement B is **FALSE**.\n\n**Option C Analysis:** \"Keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor may experience surge\"\n*   **Connection to Option A:** As established in Option A, increasing blade RPM at constant mass flow leads to positive incidence and flow separation (stalling) on the pressure surface. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2 & 3) explicitly states: \"Stalling leads to reduced pressure rise, efficiency, and potentially surge.\" Surge is a severe aerodynamic instability characterized by flow reversal and large pressure oscillations, typically triggered by extensive stall at low mass flow rates or high pressure ratios. Therefore, if the positive incidence stall becomes severe enough, it can lead to surge. Statement C is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option D Analysis:** \"At the same blade RPM, if the mass flow rate is increased, the compressor may experience surge\"\n*   **Connection to Option B:** As established in Option B, increasing mass flow rate at constant RPM leads to negative incidence and flow separation on the suction surface. This condition is typically associated with the compressor approaching its *choke* limit, where the flow reaches sonic velocity in a minimum area, limiting further mass flow increase. Surge, conversely, occurs at *low* mass flow rates (or high pressure ratios) due to extensive stalling. Increasing mass flow moves the operating point away from the surge line and towards the choke line on a compressor map. Therefore, Statement D is **FALSE**."

          "**Step 1: Understand Compressor Off-Design Principles.** Recognize that compressor performance is highly sensitive to deviations from design conditions, particularly concerning flow angles and incidence. The goal is to avoid flow separation (stall) which can lead to instability (surge) or flow limitation (choke).",
          "**Step 2: Recall Velocity Triangles and Mass Flow Equation.** The fundamental relationships are the mass flow rate equation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$ (where $V_x$ is axial velocity) and the velocity triangle vector sum $\\vec{V} = \\vec{U} + \\vec{w}$ (where $\\vec{V}$ is absolute velocity, $\\vec{U}$ is blade speed, and $\\vec{w}$ is relative velocity). The relative flow angle $\\beta$ (measured from the axial direction) is given by $\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze Option A (Increased RPM, Constant Mass Flow).** If mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is constant, $V_x$ is approximately constant. If blade RPM (and thus $U$) increases, the term $(U - V_{\\theta})$ in the $\\tan(\\beta)$ equation increases. This causes the relative flow angle $\\beta$ to increase, meaning $\\beta > \\beta_{design}$. This condition is *positive incidence*, leading to flow separation on the pressure surface. Thus, Option A is TRUE.",
          "**Step 4: Analyze Option B (Increased Mass Flow, Constant RPM).** If mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) increases, $V_x$ must increase. If blade RPM (and thus $U$) is constant, the term $\\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$ in the $\\tan(\\beta)$ equation decreases (due to increasing $V_x$). This causes the relative flow angle $\\beta$ to decrease, meaning $\\beta < \\beta_{design}$. This condition is *negative incidence*, leading to flow separation on the suction surface. The statement claims positive incidence, so Option B is FALSE.",
          "**Step 5: Analyze Option C (Increased RPM, Constant Mass Flow, Surge).** As established in Step 3, increasing RPM at constant mass flow leads to positive incidence and flow separation (stalling). The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2 & 3) states that stalling can \"potentially surge.\" Surge is a severe instability caused by extensive stall. Thus, Option C is TRUE.",
          "**Step 6: Analyze Option D (Increased Mass Flow, Constant RPM, Surge).** As established in Step 4, increasing mass flow at constant RPM leads to negative incidence. This condition is typically associated with the compressor approaching *choke* (mass flow limit due to sonic velocity), not surge. Surge occurs at low mass flow rates. Thus, Option D is FALSE."

Understanding the shape of the constant RPM lines and the location of surge and choke lines can directly answer questions about stability.",
