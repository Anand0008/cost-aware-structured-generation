        "reasoning": "We start from the design point of a single-stage axial compressor. At design, the incidence angle at rotor inlet is zero: the relative flow angle \\(\\beta_{2,\\text{rel}}\\) matches the rotor metal angle.\\n\\nINCIDENCE BEHAVIOUR (OPTIONS A, B):\\nThe rotor inlet relative velocity is given by the velocity triangle relation (using common notation) \\(\\vec{W}_2 = \\vec{V}_2 - \\vec{U}\\), where \\(\\vec{V}_2\\) is absolute velocity from stator and \\(\\vec{U}\\) is blade speed. The incidence is the difference between the actual relative flow angle \\(\\beta_2\\) and the blade metal angle.\\n\\n1) Effect of increasing RPM at constant mass flow (Option A):\\n- Increasing RPM increases blade speed \\(U\\).\\n- For a given mass flow \\(\\dot{m}\\) and nearly constant axial velocity design (RAG Chunk 1: \\(\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x\\), \\(V_x\\) approximately constant), the axial component \\(V_x\\) is fixed by continuity and geometry.\\n- At fixed stator exit flow angle \\(\\alpha_2\\) (stator metal angle unchanged), the tangential component \\(V_{\\theta 2}\\) is roughly unchanged for small off-design.\\n- In the velocity triangle, increasing \\(U\\) while keeping \\(V_x\\) and \\(V_{\\theta 2}\\) nearly the same rotates the relative velocity vector \\(\\vec{W}_2\\) towards the pressure surface of the rotor blade, giving a larger relative flow angle \\(\\beta_2\\) than the design blade angle (positive incidence).\\n- From axial-compressor off-design theory (RAG Chunks 2 and 3 discuss how changes in axial component change incidence; similarly, changing \\(U\\) at fixed \\(V_x\\) changes incidence), this can cause flow separation on the pressure side: positive incidence stall.\\n- Therefore statement A is TRUE.\\n\\n2) Effect of increasing mass flow at same RPM (Option B):\\n- At fixed RPM, \\(U\\) is constant. Increasing mass flow at a given inlet condition requires higher axial velocity \\(V_x\\) through the stage (since \\(\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x\\)).\\n- With higher \\(V_x\\), the absolute velocity vector \\(\\vec{V}_2\\) becomes more axial (larger axial component, same or slightly changed tangential component depending on stator behaviour).\\n- In the rotor inlet triangle, for fixed \\(U\\), increasing \\(V_x\\) swings the relative velocity vector towards the suction surface, i.e., \\(\\beta_2\\) decreases (more aligned with axial direction). This is a negative incidence (actual relative flow angle smaller than blade angle), not positive.\\n- RAG Chunks 2 and 3: they explicitly state that when axial velocity is higher than design, the relative velocity swings towards the suction surface, giving negative incidence; when axial velocity is lower, it swings towards the pressure surface, giving positive incidence.\\n- Therefore statement B, which claims positive incidence for increased mass flow at same RPM, is FALSE.\\n\\nSURGE BEHAVIOUR (OPTIONS C, D):\\nSurge is a global instability of the compressor, associated with operation near the left side of the compressor map (low mass flow, high pressure ratio).\\n\\n3) Increasing RPM at constant mass flow (Option C):\\n- On a compressor characteristic map (pressure ratio vs mass flow for different speeds), at a given mass flow, increasing speed moves the operating point to a higher-speed line, which generally has higher pressure ratio at the same flow.\\n- This moves the point closer to the surge line (left boundary) because surge typically occurs at high pressure ratio for a given speed. If the new operating point crosses the surge line, the compressor will surge.\\n- Thus, keeping mass flow constant and increasing RPM can indeed cause surge. Statement C is TRUE.\\n\\n4) Increasing mass flow at same RPM (Option D):\\n- At fixed speed, increasing mass flow moves the operating point to the right on the same speed line, away from the surge line and towards the choke region.\\n- Surge is associated with too low mass flow; choke with too high mass flow. So increasing mass flow at the same RPM reduces surge risk and instead may approach choke.\\n- Therefore statement D, which claims surge when mass flow is increased at same RPM, is FALSE.\\n\\nHence the correct options are A and C, matching the official key."
