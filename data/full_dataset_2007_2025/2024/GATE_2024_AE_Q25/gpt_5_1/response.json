That behavior is path-dependent and dissipative, characteristic of inelastic (viscoelastic or plastic) materials, not of an elastic material. For a nonlinear elastic material, the stress-strain curve can be nonlinear, but loading and unloading follow the same path and there is no hysteresis or permanent strain; strain energy is fully recoverable. Hence A is incorrect.\nOption B states that material properties are independent of position in a homogeneous material. This matches the standard definition of homogeneity: properties are the same at every point in the body. So B is correct.\nOption C states that an isotropic material has infinitely many planes of material symmetry. Isotropy means properties are identical in all directions; equivalently, the material is invariant under any rotation. Therefore every plane through a point is a plane of material symmetry, giving infinitely many such planes. So C is correct.\nOption D shows a straight-line stress-strain graph with the same line for loading and unloading. This is the idealized behavior of a linear elastic material obeying Hooke\\'s law, where stress is proportional to strain and deformation is fully recoverable. So D is correct.\nThus the correct options are B, C, and D, matching the official key."

This aligned well with the conceptual content of the question. Some details about hysteresis and nonlinear elasticity were supplemented from internal knowledge."
