        "reasoning": "Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: The stress-strain graph for a nonlinear elastic material is as shown in the figure (hysteresis loop shown)**\n*   The figure for option A shows a loading curve and an unloading curve that do not coincide, forming a hysteresis loop. This indicates that energy is dissipated during the loading-unloading cycle, and some permanent deformation might occur or the material exhibits time-dependent (viscoelastic) behavior. For any purely elastic material (linear or nonlinear), the deformation must be fully recoverable, meaning the unloading path must retrace the loading path, and no energy is lost as heat. Therefore, the graph shown is characteristic of an inelastic or viscoelastic material, not a purely nonlinear elastic material. Thus, Option A is **incorrect**.\n\n**Option B: Material properties are independent of position in a homogeneous material**\n*   According to retrieved knowledge (Chunk 5), a **Homogeneous Material** is defined as 'A material whose properties (e.g., density, elastic moduli) are uniform throughout its volume, meaning they are the same at every point.' This directly means that material properties are independent of position. Thus, Option B is **correct**.\n\n**Option C: An isotropic material has infinitely many planes of material symmetry**\n*   Retrieved knowledge (Chunk 3, Chunk 4, Chunk 5) defines an **Isotropic Material** as one that possesses identical mechanical and thermal properties in all directions at a given point. This directional independence implies continuous rotational symmetry. If a material's properties are the same in *all* directions, then any plane passing through a point in the material can be considered a plane of symmetry. Therefore, an isotropic material indeed has infinitely many planes of material symmetry. Thus, Option C is **correct**.\n\n**Option D: The stress-strain graph for a linear elastic material is (straight line shown)**\n*   The figure for option D shows a straight line passing through the origin, with the loading and unloading paths coinciding along this line. Retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2) states that a **Linear Elastic Material** exhibits stress directly proportional to strain ($\\sigma = E\\epsilon$, Hooke's Law), and its deformation is fully recoverable. This behavior is graphically represented by a straight line on a stress-strain plot, where the loading and unloading paths are identical. Thus, Option D is **correct**.\n\nBased on the analysis, options B, C, and D are correct."
