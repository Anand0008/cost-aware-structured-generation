The general thrust equation for an air-breathing engine is $T = \\dot{m}_a (1 + f) V_e - \\dot{m}_a V_{\\infty} + (p_e - p_{\\infty}) A_e$. The problem statement provides two crucial simplifications:\n1.  \"Assume the engine exit pressure is equal to the ambient pressure\" ($p_e = p_{\\infty}$). This means the pressure thrust term $(p_e - p_{\\infty}) A_e$ becomes zero.\n2.  \"the fuel-air ratio is negligible\" ($f \\approx 0$). This means $(1+f) \\approx 1$ and the mass flow rate of exhaust gases ($\\dot{m}_e$) can be approximated as the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$).\n\nWith these simplifications, the thrust equation reduces to $T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) entering the engine:\n$\\dot{m}_a = \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty} A_i$\nGiven:\n$\\rho_{\\infty} = 1 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$V_{\\infty} = 250 \\text{ m/s}$\n$A_i = 1 \\text{ m}^2$\n$\\dot{m}_a = (1 \\text{ kg/m}^3) \\times (250 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1 \\text{ m}^2) = 250 \\text{ kg/s}$\n\nNext, substitute the calculated mass flow rate and the given velocities into the simplified thrust equation:\n$T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$\nGiven:\n$V_e = 550 \\text{ m/s}$\n$V_{\\infty} = 250 \\text{ m/s}$\n$T = (250 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (550 \\text{ m/s} - 250 \\text{ m/s})$\n$T = (250 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (300 \\text{ m/s})$\n$T = 75000 \\text{ N}$\n\nThis calculated value matches the provided correct answer."

Also, note the simplifying assumptions: engine exit pressure equals ambient pressure ($p_e = p_{\\infty}$) and negligible fuel-air ratio ($f \\approx 0$).",

Since the fuel-air ratio ($f$) is negligible, $(1+f)$ can be approximated as 1, and the mass flow rate of exhaust gases ($\\dot{m}_e$) is approximately equal to the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$). Since the engine exit pressure ($p_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($p_{\\infty}$), the pressure thrust term $(p_e - p_{\\infty}) A_e$ becomes zero. The simplified thrust equation is therefore $T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 2, 3, and 5 were highly relevant and directly provided the general thrust equation, its simplified forms under the given conditions (negligible fuel-air ratio, $p_e = p_{\\infty}$), and the method for calculating mass flow rate. This significantly aided in confirming the correct formula and approach. Chunks 4 and 6, while related to turbojet engines, focused on detailed cycle analysis and nozzle performance, which were not directly required for this specific problem."

The average velocity of the exhaust gases at the exit of the nozzle, with respect to aircraft, is 550 m/s. Assume the engine exit pressure is equal to the ambient pressure and the fuel-air ratio is negligible. The uninstalled thrust produced by the engine at these conditions is _________ N (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
