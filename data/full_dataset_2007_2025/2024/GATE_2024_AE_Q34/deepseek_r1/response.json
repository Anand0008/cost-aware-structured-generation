Chunks 4 and 6 were also about turbojet performance but included more complex parameters (nozzle efficiency, component performance) not needed for this simplified problem."

    "question_text": "An aircraft with a turbojet engine is flying with 250 m/s speed at an altitude, where the density of air is 1 kg/m3. The inlet area of the engine is 1 m2. The average velocity of the exhaust gases at the exit of the nozzle, with respect to aircraft, is 550 m/s. Assume the engine exit pressure is equal to the ambient pressure and the fuel-air ratio is negligible. The uninstalled thrust produced by the engine at these conditions is _________ N (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
