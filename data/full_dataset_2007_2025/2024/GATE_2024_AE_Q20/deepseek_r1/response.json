        "reasoning": "A drag polar for a subsonic general aviation aircraft plots drag coefficient ($C_D$) against lift coefficient ($C_L$). Its characteristic shape is a curve that has a minimum drag value at some $C_L$ (often near zero lift) and increases symmetrically (approximately) as $C_L$ increases or decreases. It does NOT start at the origin (0,0) because there is zero-lift drag ($C_{D,0}$). The curve is monotonic away from the minimum; it does not peak and then descend. The image description for Plot C (starts at origin, peaks, descends) matches a lift curve ($C_L$ vs. $\\alpha$) or other aerodynamic plot, not a drag polar. Therefore, the correct figure is D, which should show a curve with a minimum at a positive $C_D$, increasing on both sides."

          "Step 3: Identify key features that disqualify incorrect plots. A drag polar does NOT start at the origin (0,0) because at zero lift ($C_L=0$), drag is $C_{D,0} > 0$. It also does not have a 'hump' shape that peaks and then descends; $C_D$ increases monotonically with $|C_L|$.",
