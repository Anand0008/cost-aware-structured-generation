        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the TRUE statements for an axial turbine. We will analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: For a fixed rotational speed, the mass flow rate increases with increase in the flow coefficient.**\n*   The flow coefficient is defined as $\\phi = c_a / u$, where $c_a$ is the axial velocity and $u$ is the mean blade speed (rotational speed).\n*   The mass flow rate is given by $\\dot{m} = \\rho A c_a$, where $\\rho$ is the density and $A$ is the flow area.\n*   If the rotational speed ($u$) is fixed, and the flow coefficient ($\\phi$) increases, it implies that the axial velocity ($c_a$) must increase (since $c_a = \\phi \\cdot u$).\n*   Assuming the density ($\\rho$) and flow area ($A$) remain relatively constant for a given operating condition, an increase in $c_a$ will directly lead to an increase in the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$). Therefore, this statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option B: The absolute stagnation enthalpy of the flow decreases across the nozzle row.**\n*   A nozzle row in an axial turbine is a stationary component. It is typically assumed to be an adiabatic device (no heat transfer) and does not perform any shaft work.\n*   According to the steady flow energy equation, for an adiabatic device with no shaft work, the absolute stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) remains constant across the device. RAG Chunk 3 explicitly states this principle for nozzles and diffusers.\n*   Therefore, the absolute stagnation enthalpy of the flow remains constant across the nozzle row, it does not decrease. This statement is **FALSE**.\n\n**Option C: The relative stagnation enthalpy remains unchanged through the rotor.**\n*   The rotor is a rotating component. While the absolute stagnation enthalpy changes across the rotor (due to shaft work being extracted, as per Euler Turbine Equation in RAG Chunk 1), the relative stagnation enthalpy ($h_{0,rel}$) remains constant for an adiabatic flow through the rotor.\n*   This is a fundamental principle of turbomachinery: for adiabatic flow through a rotor, the relative stagnation enthalpy is conserved because there is no work transfer in the relative frame of reference (the blades are stationary relative to themselves, and the work is done by the fluid on the rotor in the absolute frame).\n*   Therefore, this statement is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option D: For a fixed rotational speed, the mass flow rate remains unchanged with a change in the flow coefficient.**\n*   As explained for Option A, if the flow coefficient changes while rotational speed is fixed, the axial velocity ($c_a$) must change. Since $\\dot{m} = \\rho A c_a$, a change in $c_a$ will result in a change in $\\dot{m}$.\n*   This statement directly contradicts Option A, which was found to be true. Therefore, this statement is **FALSE**.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and C are TRUE."
