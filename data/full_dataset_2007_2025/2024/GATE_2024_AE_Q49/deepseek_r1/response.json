At constant density (or for typical turbine operating conditions), increasing φ means increasing V_a, which increases m_dot. Option B is FALSE: In an adiabatic nozzle (stator) with no work, stagnation enthalpy is conserved (h_0 = constant), not decreased. This is from the Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE). Option C is TRUE: For an adiabatic rotor, relative stagnation enthalpy (h_0,rel) is constant. In the rotating reference frame, there is no work interaction, so SFEE with Q=0, W_s=0 gives h_0,rel_in = h_0,rel_out. Option D is FALSE: It contradicts A."
