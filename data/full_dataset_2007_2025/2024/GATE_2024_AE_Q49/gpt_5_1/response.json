        "reasoning": "Option A: Flow coefficient for an axial turbine is typically defined as \\(\\phi = c_a/u\\), where \\(c_a\\) is axial velocity and \\(u\\) is blade speed. For a given annulus area and density, mass flow rate is \\(\\dot{m} = \\rho A c_a\\). At fixed rotational speed, \\(u\\) is constant, so increasing \\(\\phi\\) implies increasing \\(c_a\\), which directly increases \\(\\dot{m}\\). Hence A is true.\n\nOption B: Across the stator/nozzle row of an ideal axial turbine, the process is adiabatic with no shaft work, so absolute stagnation enthalpy \\(h_0 = h + c^2/2\\) is conserved. The nozzle converts \\(h\\) to kinetic energy but \\(h_0\\) remains constant. Therefore, it does not decrease; B is false.\n\nOption C: In the rotor, we consider the relative frame. For an adiabatic rotor with shaft work but no heat transfer, the *absolute* stagnation enthalpy decreases (this is where turbine work comes from). However, in the *relative* frame, the steady-flow energy equation with no heat transfer and no shaft work (in that frame) gives \\(h_{0,rel} = h + w^2/2\\) constant along a streamline. Thus relative stagnation enthalpy remains unchanged through the rotor; C is true.\n\nOption D: Directly contradicts A. Since \\(\\dot{m} \\propto c_a \\propto \\phi\\) at fixed speed and geometry, mass flow rate does change with flow coefficient. So D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C, matching the official key."
