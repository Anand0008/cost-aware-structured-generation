This is because the flow coefficient is defined as the ratio of the axial velocity to the blade speed. Increasing the flow coefficient at a fixed rotational speed means the axial velocity increases, leading to a higher mass flow rate.\nC. The relative stagnation enthalpy remains unchanged through the rotor. This is due to the conservation of stagnation enthalpy in an adiabatic, no-work process, as discussed in the retrieved knowledge."
