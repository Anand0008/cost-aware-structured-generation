        "reasoning": "For steady, one-dimensional, isentropic flow in a variable-area duct, the area-Mach relation shows that the minimum area A\\* corresponds to M = 1 for the *critical* solution that smoothly connects a subsonic state to a supersonic state. However, the same geometric minimum area can also be traversed by a purely supersonic flow that is decelerating isentropically, never passing through M = 1 at that location. In that case, the Mach number at the minimum area remains M > 1. The question states that the incoming flow is already supersonic (M > 1) and that the flow is isentropic through the CD duct. Depending on the imposed upstream and downstream conditions, two isentropic solutions are possible: (1) a choked solution with M = 1 at the throat (sonic) and supersonic on both sides, or (2) an entirely supersonic decelerating solution with M > 1 everywhere, including at the throat. Therefore, the throat Mach number can be either sonic or supersonic, but not subsonic. Hence option C is correct."

          "Step 3: For M > 1 (supersonic), the area\\-velocity relation dA/A = (M^2 \\- 1) dV/V implies that a converging section (dA < 0) decelerates the flow (dV < 0), while a diverging section accelerates it.",
          "Step 4: In the given CD duct, a supersonic flow entering the converging part can either: (a) decelerate but remain supersonic through the minimum area, or (b) decelerate to exactly M = 1 at the minimum area if the flow is choked by downstream conditions.",
          "Step 5: Because both an M = 1 state and an M > 1 state at the throat are compatible with steady, isentropic, supersonic inflow and appropriate pressure ratios, the throat Mach number is not uniquely fixed to sonic; it can be sonic or supersonic.",
