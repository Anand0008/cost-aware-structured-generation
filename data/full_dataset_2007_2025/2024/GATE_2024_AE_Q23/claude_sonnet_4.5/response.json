This is a necessary consequence of the area-velocity relation in isentropic compressible flow. Beyond the throat, the flow can either remain sonic or accelerate to a supersonic state, depending on the downstream pressure conditions. Therefore, option C, 'Can either be sonic or supersonic', correctly describes the flow at the throat of the CD duct."
