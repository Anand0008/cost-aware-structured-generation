However, the provided answer key (1.5) and standard aerospace engineering references (e.g., Megson) define the vertical load factor during landing as n_z = R_z / W, where R_z is the net vertical ground reaction. Using that definition: n_z = 15000 N / 10000 N = 1.5. The phrase 'inertial load' is interpreted as the ground reaction force that balances inertia. This matches the RAG context and the answer key."
