        "reasoning": "The question asks for the landing vertical load factor. While the question provides a potentially misleading definition ('ratio of inertial load to the weight of the aircraft'), the standard and widely accepted definition of vertical load factor ($n_z$) during landing is the ratio of the total vertical ground reaction force ($R_z$) to the aircraft's weight ($W$). Using this standard definition, $n_z = R_z / W = 15000 \\text{ N} / 10000 \\text{ N} = 1.5$. This calculation matches the provided correct answer. If the question's explicit definition of 'inertial load to weight' were strictly followed, the inertial load would be $R_z - W = 15000 - 10000 = 5000 \\text{ N}$, and the load factor would be $(R_z - W) / W = 5000 \\text{ N} / 10000 \\text{ N} = 0.5$, which contradicts the answer key. Therefore, the standard definition is assumed to be the intended interpretation."

During landing, the vertical forces are the upward ground reaction ($R_z$), the downward weight ($W$), and the upward inertial force ($m \\cdot a_z$). So, $R_z - W = m \\cdot a_z$. The load factor $n_z$ is related to acceleration by $n_z = 1 + \\frac{a_z}{g}$. From this, $a_z = (n_z - 1)g$. Substituting $a_z$ into the force balance equation: $R_z - W = m \\cdot (n_z - 1)g = \\frac{W}{g} \\cdot (n_z - 1)g = W(n_z - 1)$. Rearranging gives $R_z = W + W(n_z - 1) = W + Wn_z - W = Wn_z$.
