There are 6 possible outcomes for each die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and 3 of them are odd (1, 3, 5). The probability of getting an odd number on one die is 3/6 = 0.5. Since the rolls of the two dice are independent, the probability of getting odd numbers on both dice is the product of the probabilities for each die, which is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Rounding this to 2 decimal places gives the range 0.24 to 0.26, which matches the correct answer."
