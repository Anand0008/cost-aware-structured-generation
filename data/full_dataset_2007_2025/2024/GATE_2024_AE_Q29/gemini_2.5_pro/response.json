There are 3 favorable outcomes (odd numbers) out of 6 total possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting an odd number on one die is:\n$P(\\text{odd on one die}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of odd outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince the two dice rolls are independent events, the probability of getting odd numbers on both dice is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$P(\\text{odd on both dice}) = P(\\text{odd on Die 1}) \\times P(\\text{odd on Die 2})$\n$P(\\text{odd on both dice}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$\n\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, the probability is 0.25.
