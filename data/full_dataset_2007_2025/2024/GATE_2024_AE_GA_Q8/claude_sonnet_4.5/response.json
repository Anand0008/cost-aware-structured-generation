From the pie chart, the percentage contribution of the three fat types (saturated, unsaturated, and trans) is 20%, 20%, and 5% respectively. Using the energy density values provided in the table, we can calculate the total fat as follows:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the energy contribution of each fat type.\nSaturated fat: 20% of 2000 kcal = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 kcal\nUnsaturated fat: 20% of 2000 kcal = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 kcal \nTrans fat: 5% of 2000 kcal = 0.05 * 2000 = 100 kcal\n\nStep 2: Convert the energy contributions to masses using the energy density.\nSaturated fat mass = 400 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 44.4 g\nUnsaturated fat mass = 400 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 44.4 g\nTrans fat mass = 100 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 11.1 g\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total fat by summing the three fat types.\nTotal fat = 44.4 g + 44.4 g + 11.1 g = 100 g\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, 100 g."
