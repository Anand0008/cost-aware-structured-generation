        "reasoning": "The question asks for the total fat (all three types) in grams consumed by a person on a 2,000 kcal diet. The pie chart shows the percentage contribution of different macronutrients, and a table provides their energy densities.\n\n1.  **Identify total fat percentage:** From the pie chart, the contributions are: Unsaturated fat = 20%, Saturated fat = 20%, Trans fat = 5%. Total fat percentage = $20\\% + 20\\% + 5\\% = 45\\%$.\n2.  **Calculate total calories from fat:** The total diet is 2,000 kcal. Calories from fat = $45\\%$ of $2,000 \text{ kcal} = 0.45 \\times 2,000 \text{ kcal} = 900 \text{ kcal}$.\n3.  **Identify energy density of fat:** From the table, the energy density for all types of fat (Unsaturated, Saturated, Trans) is 9 kcal/g.\n4.  **Calculate total fat in grams:** Mass (g) = Calories (kcal) / Energy density (kcal/g). So, Total fat = $\\frac{900 \\text{ kcal}}{9 \\text{ kcal/g}} = 100 \\text{ g}$.\n\nThis matches option C."
