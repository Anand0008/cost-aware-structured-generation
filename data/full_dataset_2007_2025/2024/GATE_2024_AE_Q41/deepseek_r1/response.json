Therefore, the most relevant chunk was highly useful, while others provided background context. Internal knowledge was used to confirm the standard efficiency relationship and perform the calculation."

The engine has a thermal efficiency of 35% while burning the fuel at a rate of 3 kg/s. Assume the engine exit pressure to be equal to the ambient pressure. What is the propulsion efficiency of the engine under these conditions (in percentage)?"
