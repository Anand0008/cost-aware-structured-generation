        "notes": "RAG provided excellent background on the Prandtl-Meyer function (ν(M)), Mach angle (μ), and the relation θ = ν₂ - ν₁. It also included examples of nozzle design using method of characteristics, which indirectly supports the geometry of expansion fans. However, the explicit formula for δ (angle between Mach lines) was not directly given; it required combining the geometric insight from method of characteristics (chunk 2) with the Prandtl-Meyer and Mach angle definitions. Thus, RAG was very helpful but not complete for the specific calculation."
