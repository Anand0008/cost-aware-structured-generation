        "reasoning": "Directional static stability, also known as weathercock stability, describes an aircraft's initial tendency to align its longitudinal axis with the relative wind after experiencing a sideslip (beta) disturbance. This tendency is due to the generation of a restoring yawing moment.\n\n*   **Option A: The airplane when disturbed in yaw, from an equilibrium state, will experience a restoring moment.** This is the fundamental definition of static stability. If an aircraft is directionally stable, a disturbance (like a sideslip, which causes yaw) will induce a moment that tries to bring the aircraft back to its original, undisturbed state (zero sideslip). This is explicitly stated in the RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n*   **Option B: The variation of yawing moment coefficient (Cn) with sideslip angle (beta) for the airplane will look like (Graph shown with positive slope).** The condition for positive directional static stability is that the derivative of the yawing moment coefficient (`C_n`) with respect to the sideslip angle (`beta`) must be positive, i.e., `dC_n / d(beta) > 0` or `C_n_beta > 0`. A positive `beta` (relative wind from the right) should generate a positive `C_n` (nose to the right, or a yawing moment that pushes the nose back to the right to reduce `beta` towards zero, which is a restoring moment). The graph shown in the option depicts `C_n` increasing with `beta`, meaning it has a positive slope (`C_n_beta > 0`). This graph correctly represents a directionally stable aircraft. This is directly supported by the RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n*   **Option C: The airplane will always tend to point into the relative wind.** This is a direct consequence and a physical intuition for directional static stability. Like a weathercock or an arrow, a directionally stable aircraft will naturally turn its nose into the oncoming relative wind to eliminate any sideslip. This is mentioned in the RAG context as 'weathercock stability' and 'align its longitudinal axis with the relative wind' (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n*   **Option D: The airplane when disturbed in yaw will return to equilibrium state in a finite amount of time after removing the disturbance.** This statement describes dynamic stability, not static stability. Static stability only concerns the *initial tendency* to return to equilibrium (i.e., whether a restoring moment is generated). Dynamic stability determines *how* the aircraft returns to equilibrium (e.g., oscillating or aperiodically, and in what time frame). A statically stable aircraft can still be dynamically unstable (e.g., spiral divergence), meaning it might not return to equilibrium or might do so in an oscillatory manner that diverges over time. Therefore, this option is incorrect for describing *static* stability alone."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the definition of directional static stability. Directional static stability (or weathercock stability) is the aircraft's initial tendency to return to its equilibrium side-slip angle (zero sideslip) after a disturbance in yaw (sideslip angle, $\\beta$).",
          "Step 2: Evaluate Option A. A directionally stable aircraft, when disturbed in yaw (e.g., by a crosswind creating sideslip), will generate a yawing moment that opposes the disturbance and tries to restore the aircraft to its original heading. This is the definition of a restoring moment. Thus, Option A is correct.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option B using the provided graph. The condition for positive directional static stability is that the derivative of the yawing moment coefficient ($C_n$) with respect to the sideslip angle ($\\beta$) must be positive, i.e., $C_{n_{\\beta}} = dC_n / d\\beta > 0$. The graph shows $C_n$ increasing linearly with $\\beta$, indicating a positive slope ($C_{n_{\\beta}} > 0$). For a positive $\\beta$, a positive $C_n$ is generated, which is a restoring moment (e.g., if wind comes from the right, $\\beta > 0$, a moment turning the nose to the right is generated to align with the wind). This graph correctly represents directional static stability. Thus, Option B is correct.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C. The 'weathercock' analogy for directional stability implies that the aircraft will naturally tend to point its nose into the relative wind, just like a weathercock points into the wind. This action reduces the sideslip angle to zero. Thus, Option C is correct.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option D. This option describes the aircraft's behavior over time, specifically returning to equilibrium in a finite amount of time. This is the definition of dynamic stability. Static stability only guarantees the *initial tendency* to return, not the actual time-dependent response. An aircraft can be statically stable but dynamically unstable (e.g., spiral divergence). Therefore, Option D is incorrect as it refers to dynamic stability, not static stability."
