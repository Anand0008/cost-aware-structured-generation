        "reasoning": "Directional (weathercock) static stability means that after a small yaw/sideslip disturbance, the aircraft initially develops a restoring yawing moment tending to align its nose with the relative wind. Mathematically, this requires a positive derivative of yawing moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle: C_n_\\beta = dC_n/d\\beta > 0.\\n\\nOption A: This is exactly the definition of static stability in yaw: a disturbance in yaw (or sideslip) from equilibrium produces a restoring moment. So A is correct.\\n\\nOption B: The provided graph shows C_n on the vertical axis and \\beta on the horizontal axis, with a straight line through the origin having positive slope (C_n increases with \\beta). This represents C_n_\\beta > 0, which is the mathematical condition for positive directional static stability, as given in the RAG (Nelson, Prof. Ghosh). So B is correct.\\n\\nOption C: A directionally statically stable airplane tends to align its longitudinal axis with the relative wind, like a weathercock or arrow; i.e., it tends to point into the relative wind whenever there is sideslip. This is the physical description of weathercock stability, so C is correct as a qualitative statement.\\n\\nOption D: This statement refers to the time evolution and actual return to equilibrium after the disturbance is removed, which is a matter of dynamic stability, not static stability. Static stability only guarantees the initial restoring tendency, not that the motion will decay and return to equilibrium in finite time (it could oscillate neutrally or diverge slowly). Therefore D is not implied by static stability and is incorrect in this context.\\n\\nThus the correct options are A, B, and C, matching the official key."
