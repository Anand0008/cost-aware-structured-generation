        "reasoning": "The question requires filling in blanks with appropriate words to complete idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs, ensuring grammatical correctness and contextual meaning. Let's analyze each blank:\n\n*   **Blank (i): \"keep his head (i)\"**\n    *   The common idiom is \"keep one's head down,\" which means to stay focused, concentrate, or avoid drawing attention. In the context of batting, it implies focusing on the game and the ball, avoiding distractions. Therefore, 'down' is the most suitable word.\n\n*   **Blank (ii): \"heading (ii) to bat\"**\n    *   The phrasal verb \"heading out to bat\" is a standard expression in sports, particularly cricket, describing the action of a player moving from the dugout or pavilion onto the playing field to bat. While 'down' could also be used, 'out' is more commonly associated with moving onto a field of play.\n\n*   **Blank (iii): \"a head (iii) batting\"**\n    *   The idiom \"a head for something\" means having a natural aptitude, talent, or good understanding for that particular activity. Thus, \"a head for batting\" signifies Steve's natural talent or skill in batting. 'On' does not form a valid idiom here.\n\n*   **Blank (iv): \"a cool head (iv) his shoulders\"**\n    *   The well-known idiom is \"a cool head on one's shoulders,\" which describes someone who is calm, sensible, and able to think clearly, especially under pressure. This quality is highly desirable for a batsman. 'For' is grammatically incorrect in this idiomatic context.\n\nConsidering these analyses, Option C provides the best fit for all four blanks:\n*   (i) **down**: \"keep his head down\"\n*   (ii) **out**: \"heading out to bat\"\n*   (iii) **for**: \"a head for batting\"\n*   (iv) **on**: \"a cool head on his shoulders\"\n\nThis combination forms a grammatically correct and contextually meaningful sentence."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Analyze Blank (i) - \"Steve was advised to keep his head (i)\". Consider common idioms involving 'head'. The idiom \"keep one's head down\" means to stay focused or avoid trouble. This fits the context of a batsman needing to concentrate. Thus, 'down' is a strong candidate.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Blank (ii) - \"before heading (ii) to bat\". Consider phrasal verbs for moving towards a sports activity. \"Heading out to bat\" is a very common and idiomatic expression for a player going onto the field to bat. 'Down' could also be plausible, but 'out' is often preferred for moving onto a playing area.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Blank (iii) - \"while he had a head (iii) batting\". Consider idioms describing talent or aptitude. The idiom \"a head for something\" means having a natural ability or talent for that thing. Therefore, 'for' is the correct word to convey Steve's talent in batting.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Blank (iv) - \"he could only do so with a cool head (iv) his shoulders\". This is a very common idiom. \"A cool head on one's shoulders\" means being calm and sensible, especially under pressure. Thus, 'on' is the correct word.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis for each blank. Option C: (i) down, (ii) out, (iii) for, (iv) on, perfectly matches the idiomatic and contextual requirements for all four blanks."
