The x-coordinate is negative ($-\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$), meaning it is on the negative x-axis, to the left of the origin. This is also indicated by $\\theta = \\pi$.\n\nB. **It moves closer to the origin for increasing $\\Lambda$, while U is held constant:** False. The distance from the origin is $r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. If $\\Lambda$ increases (and U is constant), the value of $r$ increases.

The distance from the origin is $r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. If U increases (and $\\Lambda$ is constant), the denominator increases, causing the value of $r$ to decrease. A decreased $r$ means the stagnation point moves closer to the origin.\n\nD. **It is located along the x-axis:** True.

          "Step 2: Recall the velocity components for this combined flow. For a uniform flow $U$ in the x-direction and a source of strength $\\Lambda$ at the origin, the radial and tangential velocity components in polar coordinates are given by (from RAG Chunk 5):\n    $V_r = U\\cos\\theta + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}$\n    $V_\\theta = -U\\sin\\theta$",

          "Step 4: Solve for the location of the stagnation point. Set $V_\\theta = 0$: $-U\\sin\\theta = 0$. Since $U \\neq 0$, this implies $\\sin\\theta = 0$, so $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$. \n    Now, set $V_r = 0$ and substitute the possible $\\theta$ values:\n    If $\\theta = 0$: $U\\cos(0) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\implies r = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. This is physically impossible as $r$ must be positive.\n    If $\\theta = \\pi$: $U\\cos(\\pi) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = -U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\implies U = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$.",
          "Step 5: State the stagnation point location. The stagnation point is therefore located at $(r, \\theta) = \\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, \\pi\\right)$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is $(x, y) = \\left(-\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, 0\\right)$.",
