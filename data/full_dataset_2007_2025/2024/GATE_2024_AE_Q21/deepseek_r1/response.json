Thus, the stagnation point is on the x-axis (θ = π, negative x-direction, left of origin). r ∝ Λ/U, so for increasing Λ (U constant), r increases (moves away from origin), making statement B false. For increasing U (Λ constant), r decreases (moves closer to origin), making C true. A and D are true based on location. Hence, B is NOT true."
