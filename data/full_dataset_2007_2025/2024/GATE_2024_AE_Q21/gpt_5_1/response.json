Stagnation requires both components to be zero. From \\(V_\\theta = 0\\) with \\(U \\neq 0\\), we get \\(\\sin\\theta = 0\\Rightarrow \\theta = 0\\) or \\(\\pi\\). Substituting into \\(V_r = 0\\): for \\(\\theta = 0\\), \\(V_r = U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0\\Rightarrow r = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}\\), which is non-physical since r must be positive. For \\(\\theta = \\pi\\), \\(V_r = -U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0\\Rightarrow r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U} > 0\\). Thus the stagnation point is at \\((r,\\theta) = (\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U},\\pi)\\), i.e. on the negative x-axis (to the left of origin) and along the x-axis. Its distance from the origin is \\(x_s = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}\\). Hence: (A) true: it is to the left of origin; (D) true: it lies on x-axis; (C) true: increasing U (with \\Lambda fixed) decreases \\(|x_s|\\) so it moves closer to origin; (B) false: increasing \\Lambda (with U fixed) increases \\(|x_s|\\), so it moves farther from origin, not closer.
