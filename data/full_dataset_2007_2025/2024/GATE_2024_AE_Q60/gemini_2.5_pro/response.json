        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio of the speed of the satellite at perigee to that at apogee. For an elliptical orbit, the angular momentum ($L$) of the satellite about the central body (Moon) is conserved. Angular momentum is given by $L = m \\cdot r \\cdot V \\cdot \\sin(\\phi)$, where $m$ is the satellite's mass, $r$ is the distance from the central body, $V$ is the velocity, and $\\phi$ is the flight path angle. At both perigee and apogee, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector, meaning $\\phi = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\sin(\\phi) = 1$. Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum simplifies to $m \\cdot r_p \\cdot V_p = m \\cdot r_a \\cdot V_a$, where $r_p$ and $V_p$ are the radius and speed at perigee, and $r_a$ and $V_a$ are the radius and speed at apogee. This simplifies to $r_p \\cdot V_p = r_a \\cdot V_a$. The ratio of speeds is then $V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p$. \\n\\nGiven data:\\n- Altitude at perigee ($h_p$) = 25 km\\n- Altitude at apogee ($h_a$) = 134 km\\n- Moon's radius ($R_M$) = 1737 km\\n\\nFirst, calculate the radii from the center of the Moon:\\n- Perigee radius ($r_p$) = $R_M + h_p = 1737 \\text{ km} + 25 \\text{ km} = 1762 \\text{ km}$\\n- Apogee radius ($r_a$) = $R_M + h_a = 1737 \\text{ km} + 134 \\text{ km} = 1871 \\text{ km}$\\n\\nNow, calculate the ratio of speeds:\\n$V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p = 1871 \\text{ km} / 1762 \\text{ km} \\approx 1.06186$\\n\\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, the ratio is 1.06.
