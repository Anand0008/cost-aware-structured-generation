        "reasoning": "For dynamic similarity in low-speed flow (Mach number < 0.3), the Reynolds number (Re) must be matched between the model and full-scale car. Using the same fluid (air) with the same properties, matching Re leads to the model test velocity being scaled inversely with the length scale. The drag coefficient (C_D) remains identical under dynamic similarity. The drag force D = 0.5 * rho * V^2 * A * C_D. For a 1/3 scale model, the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. With Re matching, V_model = 3 * V_full. Substituting: D_full/D_model = (V_full^2 / V_model^2) * (A_full / A_model) = (1/9) * 9 = 1.0. The official answer key confirms 1.0."

          "Step 2: Establish geometric similarity. The model is a 1/3 scale replica, so the length scale ratio L_m/L_f = 1/3. The reference area (frontal area) scales with the square of the length scale: A_m/A_f = (L_m/L_f)^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.",
          "Step 3: Apply dynamic similarity condition. Assume the wind tunnel uses air with the same density (rho) and viscosity (mu) as the real-world conditions. Matching Reynolds numbers: Re_m = Re_f => rho * V_m * L_m / mu = rho * V_f * L_f / mu => V_m * L_m = V_f * L_f => V_m = V_f * (L_f / L_m) = 30 m/s * 3 = 90 m/s.",
          "Step 4: Recall the drag force formula: D = 0.5 * rho * V^2 * A * C_D, where C_D is the drag coefficient. Under dynamic similarity, C_D is identical for model and full-scale: C_D,m = C_D,f.",
          "Step 5: Compute the drag ratio D_f/D_m = (0.5 * rho * V_f^2 * A_f * C_D,f) / (0.5 * rho * V_m^2 * A_m * C_D,m) = (V_f^2 / V_m^2) * (A_f / A_m). Substitute V_f = 30 m/s, V_m = 90 m/s, A_f/A_m = 9: D_f/D_m = (30^2 / 90^2) * 9 = (900 / 8100) * 9 = (1/9) * 9 = 1.",

Chunk 1 (direct weighing method) was less relevant. The context sufficiently covered the principles needed to solve the problem, so internal knowledge was used only to integrate and apply to the specific numerical problem."

A one-third scale model of the car is tested in a wind-tunnel following the principles of dynamic similarity. The drag on the scaled model is measured to be Dm. The ratio D/Dm is _________ (rounded off to 1 decimal place)."
