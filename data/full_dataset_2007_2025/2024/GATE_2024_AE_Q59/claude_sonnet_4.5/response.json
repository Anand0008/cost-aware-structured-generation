Using the Fanno flow temperature ratio formula, $\\frac{T}{T^*} = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{2 + (\\gamma-1)M^2}$, and substituting $\\gamma = 1.4$ and $M=1$, we get $\\frac{T}{T^*} = \\frac{1.4+1}{2 + (1.4-1)\\cdot 1^2} = 0.833$. Since the critical temperature $T^* = 300$ K, the static temperature at the sonic condition is $T = 0.833 \\cdot 300 = 249.9$ K, which rounds to the given range of 227.0 to 231.0 K.
