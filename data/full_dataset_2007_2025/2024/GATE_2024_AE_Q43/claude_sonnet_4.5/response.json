From the three diagrams, we can observe the following:\n- The shock angle (β) decreases as the Mach number increases from M1 to M3. This is consistent with the weak shock solution, where higher Mach numbers result in smaller shock angles.\n- The downstream Mach number (M2) increases as the upstream Mach number (M1) increases. This is also characteristic of the weak shock solution, where higher upstream Mach numbers lead to higher downstream Mach numbers.\nTherefore, the correct relationship between the Mach numbers is M3 < M1 < M2, which corresponds to option D."
