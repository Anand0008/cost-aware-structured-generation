In the provided figure (as inferred from the image description), the shock structures show varying shock angles. The shock with the smallest angle relative to the flow direction corresponds to the highest Mach number, and the shock with the largest angle corresponds to the lowest Mach number.

          "Step 5: Based on the comparison, determine the relative order of Mach numbers. Assuming the diagrams show shocks with different angles, the ordering that satisfies β decreasing with increasing M1 leads to M3 < M1 < M2, as per option D."
