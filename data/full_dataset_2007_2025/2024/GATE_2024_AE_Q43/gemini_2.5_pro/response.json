        "reasoning": "The question asks to determine the relationship between the upstream Mach numbers ($M_1, M_2, M_3$) based on the observed shock structures over a *given wedge* (meaning the deflection angle $\\theta$ is constant for all three cases) and assuming only *weak shock solutions* for attached oblique shocks.\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n1.  **Case $M_3$**: The image shows a **detached bow shock** forming upstream of the wedge. According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, 2, 3), a detached bow shock forms when the flow deflection angle (wedge angle, $\\theta$) exceeds the maximum possible deflection angle ($\\theta_{max}$) for an attached oblique shock at that particular upstream Mach number. The maximum deflection angle ($\\theta_{max}$) for an attached shock *increases* with increasing upstream Mach number. Therefore, for a fixed wedge angle, a detached shock indicates a *lower* Mach number, as the flow is less able to 'turn' sharply without detaching. This implies $M_3$ is the lowest Mach number among the three.\n\n2.  **Case $M_1$ and $M_2$**: Both show **attached oblique shocks**. The question specifies that only weak shock solutions are considered. For a given wedge angle ($\\theta$), as the upstream Mach number ($M_1$) *increases*, the shock wave angle ($\\beta$) for a weak oblique shock *decreases* (i.e., the shock becomes 'flatter' or less steep relative to the incoming flow). \n    *   In the diagram for $M_1$, the attached oblique shock has a visibly *larger* shock angle ($\\beta_1$) compared to the shock angle ($\\beta_2$) for $M_2$. \n    *   Since $\\beta_1 > \\beta_2$ for the same wedge angle and weak shock solutions, it implies that $M_1 < M_2$.\n\n3.  **Combining the observations**: We have established that $M_3$ is the lowest Mach number (due to detached shock) and $M_1 < M_2$ (due to relative shock angles of attached weak shocks). \n    Therefore, the correct order is $M_3 < M_1 < M_2$."

A detached shock forms when the wedge angle (flow deflection angle, $\\theta$) is greater than the maximum deflection angle ($\\theta_{max}$) possible for an attached oblique shock at a given Mach number.

          "Step 3: Understand the relationship between upstream Mach number ($M$) and the maximum deflection angle ($\\theta_{max}$). As $M$ increases, $\\theta_{max}$ increases.

The information on how Theta_max and beta vary with Mach number was particularly helpful."
