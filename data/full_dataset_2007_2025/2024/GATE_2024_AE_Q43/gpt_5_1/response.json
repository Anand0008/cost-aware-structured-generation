Thus, a more inclined shock (larger \\(\\beta\\), closer to normal) corresponds to a lower Mach number, and a more slender shock (smaller \\(\\beta\\), closer to the Mach line) corresponds to a higher Mach number.\n\nFrom the figure:\n1) Case with label \\(M_1>1\\): A single attached oblique shock with moderate angle to the wedge.\n2) Case with label \\(M_2>1\\): Two symmetric attached shocks that are much closer to the wedge surface (smaller \\(\\beta\\)), indicating the highest Mach number among attached-shock cases.\n3) Case with label \\(M_3>1\\): A detached bow shock standing ahead of the wedge. For a given wedge angle, a detached bow shock appears when the deflection angle exceeds the maximum allowable \\(\\theta_{\\max}\\) for an attached solution at that Mach number. This happens at relatively low Mach numbers for that wedge angle (the attached-solution branch disappears as \\(M\\) decreases).\n\nTherefore, the detached-shock case (\\(M_3\\)) corresponds to the lowest Mach number, the most slender attached shock (\\(M_2\\)) to the highest Mach number, and \\(M_1\\) lies in between.
