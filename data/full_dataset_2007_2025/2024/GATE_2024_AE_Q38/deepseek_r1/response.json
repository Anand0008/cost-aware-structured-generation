        "reasoning": "The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model defines layers where temperature remains constant, known as isothermal layers (e.g., the tropopause/stratosphere from approximately 11 to 20 km). In such layers, the governing equations (hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law with constant T) lead to an exponential decay relationship for both pressure and density with increasing altitude. The RAG context explicitly states: 'rho = rho_b * e^(-(g_0 / (R * T_b)) * (h - h_b))' (Chunks 3 & 5) and 'ρ = ρ₀ * e^(-g₀h/(RT))' (Chunk 4). This confirms option D is correct. Options A (constant), B (linear increase), and C (linear decrease) describe other physical scenarios not applicable to an isothermal atmospheric layer in the ISA."

          "Step 2: Recall the governing physical laws. For a static atmosphere, the primary equations are the Hydrostatic Equation ($dP = -\\rho g dh$) and the Ideal Gas Law ($P = \\rho R T$).",
          "Step 3: Apply the isothermal condition. In an isothermal layer, $T = T_b =$ constant. This allows the combination of the hydrostatic and ideal gas laws into a single differential equation: $\\frac{dP}{P} = -\\frac{g}{RT_b} dh$.",
          "Step 4: Integrate to find the solution. Integrating from a base altitude $h_b$ (with pressure $P_b$ and density $\\rho_b$) to altitude $h$ yields: $P = P_b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g}{RT_b}(h - h_b)\\right)$.",
          "Step 5: Determine density variation. Using the ideal gas law ($\\rho = P/(R T_b)$) with constant $T_b$, density follows the same exponential relationship: $\\rho = \\rho_b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g}{RT_b}(h - h_b)\\right)$ (Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5).",
          "Step 6: Conclude the nature of variation. The function $\\exp(-k h)$ represents an exponential decay, not a constant or linear change. Therefore, density decreases exponentially with altitude in an isothermal layer."
