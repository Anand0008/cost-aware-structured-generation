According to fundamental atmospheric principles, specifically the hydrostatic equation ($dP = -\\rho g dh$) and the ideal gas law ($P = \\rho R T$), when the temperature is constant, both pressure (P) and density ($\\rho$) decrease exponentially with increasing altitude (h). The mathematical relationship for density in an isothermal layer is given by $\\rho = \\rho_b e^{{-\\frac{{g_0}}{{RT_b}}(h - h_b)}}$, where $\\rho_b$ and $T_b$ are the density and temperature at the base of the isothermal layer, and $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The exponential term $e^{{-\\frac{{g_0}}{{RT_b}}(h - h_b)}}$ clearly indicates an exponential decrease as altitude $h$ increases. Therefore, option D is correct."
