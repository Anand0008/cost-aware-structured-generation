        "reasoning": "The question asks about the variation of air density with increasing altitude in the isothermal layer of the standard atmosphere. According to the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, in the isothermal regions (such as the tropopause), the air density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude. This is because the pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, and the temperature remains constant, as per the ideal gas law. The formulas derived from the hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law show that the density follows an exponential decay relationship with altitude in the isothermal regions."
