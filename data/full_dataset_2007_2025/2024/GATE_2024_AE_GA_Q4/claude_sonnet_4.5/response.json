The ratio 5:3:13 means that for every 21 coins, there are 5 ₹1 coins, 3 ₹5 coins, and 13 ₹10 coins.\n\nThe total number of coins is 5 + 3 + 13 = 21.\n\nThe value of the ₹5 coins is 3 * ₹5 = ₹15.\nThe total value of all the coins is 5 * ₹1 + 3 * ₹5 + 13 * ₹10 = ₹5 + ₹15 + ₹130 = ₹150.\n\nThe percentage of money in ₹5 coins is (₹15 / ₹150) * 100% = 10%."
