        "reasoning": "The problem provides the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) and the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) for an ideal gas. We need to find the specific gas constant ($R$). The fundamental thermodynamic relations for an ideal gas are Mayer's relation ($c_p - c_v = R$) and the definition of the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma = c_p / c_v$). From the definition of $\\gamma$, we can express $c_v$ as $c_v = c_p / \\gamma$. Substituting this into Mayer's relation, we get $R = c_p - (c_p / \\gamma)$. This can be simplified to $R = c_p (1 - 1/\\gamma) = c_p \\left( \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\right)$. Plugging in the given values: $c_p = 1147 \\text{ J/kg K}$ and $\\gamma = 1.33$. So, $R = 1147 \\text{ J/kg K} \\times \\left( \\frac{1.33 - 1}{1.33} \\right) = 1147 \\times \\left( \\frac{0.33}{1.33} \\right) \\approx 1147 \\times 0.24812 \\approx 284.62 \\text{ J/kg K}$.
