Solving for `k`: `4k = 8`, so `k = 2`.\\n2.  **Formulate the characteristic equation**: Substitute `k = 2` into the matrix `A`, making it `A = [[5, -4], [2, -1]]`. To find the eigenvalues `$\\lambda$`, we solve the characteristic equation `$\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$`, where `I` is the identity matrix. \\n    `$A - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 - \\lambda & -4 \\ 2 & -1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$`\\n    The determinant is `$(5 - \\lambda)(-1 - \\lambda) - (-4)(2) = 0$`.\\n3.  **Solve for eigenvalues**: Expand the determinant equation:\\n    `$-(5 - \\lambda)(1 + \\lambda) + 8 = 0$`\\n    `$-(5 + 5\\lambda - \\lambda - \\lambda^2) + 8 = 0$`\\n    `$-(5 + 4\\lambda - \\lambda^2) + 8 = 0$`\\n    `$-5 - 4\\lambda + \\lambda^2 + 8 = 0$`\\n    `$\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3 = 0$`\\n    Factoring the quadratic equation: `$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 3) = 0$`.\\n    The eigenvalues are `$\\lambda_1 = 1$` and `$\\lambda_2 = 3$`.\\n4.  **Identify the largest eigenvalue**: The largest eigenvalue is `$\\lambda_{max} = 3$`.\\n5.  **Calculate the ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the largest eigenvalue of A to the constant `k`.\\n    Ratio = `$\\frac{\\lambda_{max}}{k} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$`.\\n6.  **Round off**: Rounded off to 1 decimal place, the answer is 1.5."

Chunk 3 offered context on determinants, and Chunk 6 on properties of eigenvalues (though not directly used, it reinforced the core concepts). Chunks 1 and 5 were less relevant to the analytical solution required."
