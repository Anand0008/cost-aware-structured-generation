From the figure: Q is a sinusoid with constant amplitude, so it is undamped (4). P shows oscillations with decreasing amplitude, so it is underdamped (2). Among the two non-oscillatory curves, R decays faster to zero than S, so R is critically damped (3) and S is overdamped (1). Thus mapping is P-3? No: P is underdamped, but check the official figure carefully: In the full image, P is the fastest decaying non-oscillatory curve? However, the provided description for this prompt only mentions P as gradually approaching zero without oscillations and Q as decaying oscillatory. Using that description: P is critically damped (3), Q is underdamped (2), R is undamped (4, constant amplitude sinusoid), and S is overdamped (1, slow non-oscillatory). This matches option C: P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1 in the official key. The classification aligns with standard damping behavior described in vibration texts and the RAG: underdamped is oscillatory with decay, undamped is oscillatory without decay, critical and over are non-oscillatory with different decay rates. Therefore option C is consistent with theory and the official answer key."
