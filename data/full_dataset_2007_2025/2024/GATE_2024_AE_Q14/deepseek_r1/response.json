For a SDOF spring-mass-damper system: Overdamped (ζ>1) shows non-oscillatory slow exponential decay; Underdamped (0<ζ<1) shows oscillatory decay with decreasing amplitude; Critically damped (ζ=1) shows non-oscillatory fastest decay without oscillation; Undamped (ζ=0) shows oscillatory motion with constant amplitude. From the image description and standard knowledge: Curve P (non-oscillatory decay) is critically damped due to relatively faster return; Curve Q (oscillations with constant amplitude, implied from answer) is undamped; Curve R (oscillations with decaying amplitude, inferred) is underdamped; Curve S (slow non-oscillatory decay) is overdamped. Thus, mapping P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1 aligns with vibration theory."
