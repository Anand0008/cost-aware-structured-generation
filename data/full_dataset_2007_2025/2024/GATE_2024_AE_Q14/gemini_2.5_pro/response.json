All responses are for a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper system with the same initial conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each curve based on the standard definitions of damping:\n\n1.  **Undamped System ($\\zeta = 0$):** This system oscillates indefinitely with a constant amplitude, as there is no energy dissipation. \n    *   **Curve Q** clearly shows sustained oscillations with constant amplitude. Therefore, **Q corresponds to Undamped (4)**.\n\n2.  **Underdamped System ($0 < \\zeta < 1$):** This system exhibits oscillatory motion, but the amplitude of oscillations gradually decreases over time due to energy dissipation, eventually settling to zero. \n    *   **Curve R** shows oscillations with an amplitude that visibly decays over time. Therefore, **R corresponds to Underdamped (2)**.\n\n3.  **Critically Damped System ($\\zeta = 1$):** This system returns to its equilibrium position as quickly as possible without undergoing any oscillation. It typically reaches equilibrium faster than an overdamped system and may cross the equilibrium position (zero displacement) at most once. \n    *   **Curve P** shows a non-oscillatory response that returns to equilibrium relatively quickly, crossing the zero line once before settling. This is characteristic of a critically damped system. Therefore, **P corresponds to Critically damped (3)**.\n\n4.  **Overdamped System ($\\zeta > 1$):** This system also returns to its equilibrium position without oscillation, but it does so more slowly than a critically damped system. It typically approaches equilibrium asymptotically without crossing the zero displacement line. \n    *   **Curve S** shows a non-oscillatory response that returns to equilibrium more slowly than Curve P and does not cross the zero line. This is characteristic of an overdamped system. Therefore, **S corresponds to Overdamped (1)**.\n\nCombining these observations:\n*   P - Critically damped (3)\n*   Q - Undamped (4)\n*   R - Underdamped (2)\n*   S - Overdamped (1)\n\nThis mapping matches **Option C: P - 3, Q - 4, R - 2, S - 1**."

All curves start from the same initial displacement.",
          "**Step 2: Recall Characteristics of Undamped Vibration.** An undamped system (damping ratio $\\zeta = 0$) experiences no energy loss and therefore oscillates indefinitely with a constant amplitude. Look for a curve that shows continuous, non-decaying oscillations.",
          "**Step 3: Identify the Undamped Response.** Observe Curve Q. It exhibits oscillations with a constant amplitude over time. This perfectly matches the definition of an undamped system. Thus, Q corresponds to Undamped (4).",
          "**Step 4: Recall Characteristics of Underdamped Vibration.** An underdamped system ($0 < \\zeta < 1$) oscillates, but its amplitude gradually decreases over time due to damping, eventually decaying to zero. Look for a curve showing decaying oscillations.",
          "**Step 5: Identify the Underdamped Response.** Observe Curve R. It shows oscillatory motion where the peaks and troughs progressively diminish in magnitude. This is the hallmark of an underdamped system. Thus, R corresponds to Underdamped (2).",
          "**Step 6: Recall Characteristics of Critically Damped Vibration.** A critically damped system ($\\zeta = 1$) returns to its equilibrium position as quickly as possible without any oscillation. It is the fastest non-oscillatory response and may cross the equilibrium line at most once. Look for a fast, non-oscillatory decay.",
          "**Step 7: Identify the Critically Damped Response.** Observe Curve P. It shows a smooth, non-oscillatory decay towards equilibrium. It crosses the zero displacement line once and settles relatively quickly compared to Curve S. This is characteristic of a critically damped system. Thus, P corresponds to Critically damped (3).",
          "**Step 8: Recall Characteristics of Overdamped Vibration.** An overdamped system ($\\zeta > 1$) also returns to equilibrium without oscillation, but it does so more slowly than a critically damped system. It typically approaches equilibrium asymptotically without crossing the zero displacement line. Look for a slow, non-oscillatory decay.",
          "**Step 9: Identify the Overdamped Response.** Observe Curve S. It shows a non-oscillatory decay that is noticeably slower than Curve P and does not cross the zero displacement line. This indicates an overdamped system. Thus, S corresponds to Overdamped (1).",
