This is the maneuver point or corner point described in Anderson. At this point: (1) The aircraft is at maximum allowable load factor n_max and at CL_max simultaneously. For a given speed V, turn rate is \\(\\omega = \\frac{g\\sqrt{n^2-1}}{V}\\) and turn radius is \\(R = \\frac{V^2}{g\\sqrt{n^2-1}}\\). For a given aircraft and altitude, the tightest level turn (minimum R, maximum \\(\\omega\\)) occurs at the highest possible n and the lowest possible V that still allows that n. This condition is exactly the corner velocity V* at point Q. Hence the aircraft has the highest turn rate and the smallest turn radius there (statements A and B true). (2) On the stall boundary, the aircraft is at \\(C_{L,\\max}\\), so statement D is true. (3) Minimum drag (or maximum L/D) occurs at a specific \\(C_L\\) given by \\(C_{D0} = K C_L^2\\), which is generally not equal to \\(C_{L,\\max}\\) and does not coincide with the corner point. Therefore statement C is false. Thus the correct options are A, B, and D."
