        "reasoning": "Point Q on the V-n diagram is the intersection of the stall limit curve and the positive limit load factor line. This point is known as the 'corner velocity' or 'maneuver point' ($V^*$). At this point, the aircraft simultaneously achieves its maximum allowable load factor ($n_{max}$) and its maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$).\\n\\n1.  **Statement A: The aircraft has the highest turn rate.** The turn rate ($\\omega$) for a level turn is given by $\\omega = \\frac{g\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{V}$. To maximize turn rate, the aircraft must operate at the highest possible load factor ($n$) and the lowest possible velocity ($V$) for that load factor. Point Q represents the maximum load factor ($n_{max}$) that the aircraft can sustain without exceeding structural limits, at the lowest possible speed ($V^*$) where $C_{L,max}$ is reached. Therefore, point Q corresponds to the maximum turn rate. This statement is TRUE.\\n\\n2.  **Statement B: The aircraft has the smallest turn radius.** The turn radius (R) for a level turn is given by $R = \\frac{V^2}{g\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}$. To minimize turn radius, the aircraft must operate at the highest possible load factor ($n$) and the lowest possible velocity ($V$) for that load factor. As explained for turn rate, point Q achieves this combination ($n_{max}$ at $V^*$), resulting in the smallest turn radius. This statement is TRUE.\\n\\n3.  **Statement C: The aircraft is flying with minimum drag.** Minimum drag typically occurs at the lift coefficient corresponding to maximum lift-to-drag ratio ($(L/D)_{max}$), which is generally not $C_{L,max}$. At $C_{L,max}$, the aircraft is usually at a high angle of attack, leading to significant induced drag and thus higher total drag, not minimum drag. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\\n\\n4.  **Statement D: The aircraft is operating at $C_{L,max}$.** The upward curving line from the origin to point Q represents the stall limit, which is the boundary where the aircraft reaches its maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$) for a given speed. Since point Q lies on this curve, it signifies that the aircraft is operating at $C_{L,max}$. This statement is TRUE."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify Point Q on the V-n diagram. Observe that Point Q is the intersection of the stall limit curve (the left boundary of the flight envelope, curving upwards from the origin) and the positive limit load factor line (the horizontal line representing the maximum structural load factor).",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of the 'corner velocity' or 'maneuver point' ($V^*$). This point is precisely where the aircraft can achieve its maximum load factor ($n_{max}$) while simultaneously operating at its maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$). Point Q represents this condition.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Option A regarding the highest turn rate. The turn rate ($\\omega$) is inversely proportional to velocity ($V$) and directly proportional to the square root of the load factor ($n$). Maximum turn rate is achieved at the highest possible $n$ and the lowest possible $V$. Point Q (corner velocity) represents this optimal combination for maneuverability.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option B regarding the smallest turn radius. The turn radius (R) is directly proportional to the square of velocity ($V^2$) and inversely proportional to the square root of the load factor ($n$). Minimum turn radius is achieved at the lowest possible $V$ and the highest possible $n$. Point Q (corner velocity) represents this optimal combination.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option C regarding minimum drag. Minimum drag occurs at a specific lift coefficient, typically $C_L$ for $(L/D)_{max}$. This $C_L$ is generally lower than $C_{L,max}$. Operating at $C_{L,max}$ (as at point Q) implies a high angle of attack and often high induced drag, not minimum total drag.",
          "Step 6: Analyze Option D regarding operating at $C_{L,max}$. The stall limit curve on the V-n diagram represents the boundary where the aircraft reaches $C_{L,max}$. Since Point Q lies on this curve, the aircraft is indeed operating at $C_{L,max}$ at this point.",
