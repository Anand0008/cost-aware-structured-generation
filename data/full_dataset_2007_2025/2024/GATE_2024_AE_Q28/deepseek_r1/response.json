        "reasoning": "Based on the standard interpretation of a V-n diagram, the vertical line at 'Point Q' typically represents the corner velocity (V*). At this velocity, the aircraft simultaneously achieves its maximum allowable load factor (structural limit) and maximum lift coefficient (stall limit). From flight mechanics theory: Maximum turn rate ($\\omega_{max}$) and minimum turn radius ($R_{min}$) occur at corner velocity when flying at $C_{L,max}$. Minimum drag condition is independent and occurs at the velocity for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, not necessarily at V*. Therefore, statements A, B, and D are true, while C is false."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Interpret the V-n diagram and the location of Point Q. The image description mentions a vertical line at Point Q on a V-n diagram with 'Positive limit load factor' and 'Positive ultimate load factor' curves. In standard aeronautical practice, such a vertical line at the intersection of the stall boundary and the positive limit load factor line defines the 'corner velocity' or 'maneuver speed' (V*).",
          "Step 2: Recall the significance of corner velocity (V*). At V*, the aircraft can achieve its maximum possible load factor ($n_{max}$) without stalling, meaning it is operating at its maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$). This point defines the maximum instantaneous turn performance.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement A: 'The aircraft has the highest turn rate.' The turn rate formula for a level turn is $\\omega = g \\sqrt{n^2 - 1} / V$. For a given aircraft, the maximum turn rate is achieved at the highest possible load factor and the lowest possible speed where that load factor can be sustained. This condition is met at V*. Hence, statement A is true.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement B: 'The aircraft has the smallest turn radius.' The turn radius formula for a level turn is $R = V^2 / (g \\sqrt{n^2 - 1})$. The minimum turn radius is also achieved at V* for the same reason: maximum load factor at the lowest possible speed (which is V*, not the stall speed, because at lower speeds the load factor is limited by stall before reaching $n_{max}$). Hence, statement B is true.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Statement C: 'The aircraft is flying with minimum drag.' Minimum drag occurs at the velocity corresponding to maximum lift-to-drag ratio ($(L/D)_{max}$). This condition is determined by the aircraft's drag polar and is not related to the corner velocity. The flight condition at V* typically involves high lift and high induced drag, so it is not the minimum drag condition. Hence, statement C is false.",
          "Step 6: Analyze Statement D: 'The aircraft is operating at $C_{L,max}$.' By definition, at the corner velocity, the aircraft is on the stall boundary of the V-n diagram, meaning it is operating at its maximum lift coefficient to achieve the maximum load factor. Hence, statement D is true."
