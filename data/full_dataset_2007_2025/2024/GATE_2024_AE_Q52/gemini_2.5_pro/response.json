This implies that the sum of the principal stresses ($\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2$) is equal to the sum of the normal stresses in any orthogonal coordinate system (e.g., $\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y$).\n    Therefore, for the resultant stress state:\n    $\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{x,res} + \\sigma_{y,res} = 0 + 0 = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the principal stresses explicitly for the resultant state:\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{0 - 0}{2}\\right)^2 + (-10)^2}$\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = 0 \\pm \\sqrt{0 + 100} = \\pm 10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    So, the maximum principal stress is $\\sigma_1 = 10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$ and the minimum principal stress is $\\sigma_2 = -10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n    The sum is $\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 = 10 + (-10) = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n\nThe final answer is 0.0 N/mm²."
