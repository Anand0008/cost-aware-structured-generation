    "question_text": "The state of stress at a point is caused by two separate loading cases. One of them produces a pure uniaxial tension along the x' direction, and other one produces a pure uniaxial compression along the y' direction, as shown in the figure. The sum of maximum and minimum principal stresses for the resultant state of stress caused by both loads acting simultaneously is ___________ N/mm2 (rounded off to 1 decimal place)."
