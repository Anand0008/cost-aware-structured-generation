Differentiating twice, we get ${\\ddot{x}(t)} = -\\omega^2 {X} \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix equation of motion:\n$- \\omega^2 [M]{X} + [K]{X} = {0}$\n$([K] - \\omega^2[M]){X} = {0}$\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. For non-trivial solutions (i.e., for the system to actually vibrate), the determinant of the dynamic stiffness matrix $([K] - \\omega^2[M])$ must be zero:\n$\\det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the matrices:\n$\\det \\begin{bmatrix} (2k - m\\omega^2) & -k \\ -k & (2k - m\\omega^2) \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)(2k - m\\omega^2) - (-k)(-k) = 0$\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)^2 - k^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a difference of squares, $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$, where $a = (2k - m\\omega^2)$ and $b = k$:\n$((2k - m\\omega^2) - k) ((2k - m\\omega^2) + k) = 0$\n$(k - m\\omega^2)(3k - m\\omega^2) = 0$\n\nThis characteristic equation yields two possible values for $\\omega^2$:\n1. $k - m\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies m\\omega^2 = k \\implies \\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n   So, $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n2. $3k - m\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies m\\omega^2 = 3k \\implies \\omega^2 = \\frac{3k}{m}$\n   So, $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$\n\nThe question asks for the larger of the two natural frequencies. Comparing $\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$, the larger frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$.\n\nWe need to express this in the form $\\omega = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the numerical value of $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha \\approx 1.73205$\n\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, $\\alpha = 1.73$."

Chunk 1 provided a very similar example (2-mass, 3-spring system) with the exact characteristic equation and natural frequencies, directly confirming the solution path. Chunk 3 provided the general matrix formulation for MDOF systems and the principle of the characteristic equation. Other chunks were less relevant as they focused on SDOF systems or damping, which were not directly applicable to this undamped 2-DOF problem."

The larger of the two natural frequencies is given by: omega = alpha sqrt(k/m) rad/s. The value of alpha is ________ (rounded off to 2 decimal places)."
