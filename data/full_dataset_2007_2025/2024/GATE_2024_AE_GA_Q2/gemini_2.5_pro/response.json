        "reasoning": "The problem states that $(x + y)$ is proportional to $(x - y)$. This can be written as an equation: $(x + y) = k(x - y)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. We are given that $x$ and $y$ are distinct non-zero real variables. This means $x \\neq y$, so $(x - y) \\neq 0$, which ensures $k$ is well-defined. Also, $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$. \\n\\nTo find the value of $x/y$, we rearrange the equation:\\n$x + y = kx - ky$\\nGroup terms with $x$ and $y$:\\n$y + ky = kx - x$\\nFactor out $y$ and $x$:\\n$y(1 + k) = x(k - 1)$\\nNow, form the ratio $x/y$:\\n$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1 + k}{k - 1}$\\n\\nSince $k$ is a constant, the expression $\\frac{1 + k}{k - 1}$ is also a constant. \\n\\nWe must ensure that $k - 1 \\neq 0$, i.e., $k \\neq 1$. If $k=1$, then $x+y = x-y$, which implies $2y=0$, so $y=0$. This contradicts the given condition that $y$ is a non-zero variable. Therefore, $k \\neq 1$. \\n\\nAlso, if $1+k=0$, then $k=-1$. In this case, $x+y = -(x-y) \\implies x+y = -x+y \\implies 2x=0 \\implies x=0$. This contradicts the given condition that $x$ is a non-zero variable. Therefore, $k \\neq -1$. \\n\\nSince $k$ is a constant and $k \\neq \\pm 1$, the ratio $x/y$ is always a constant value, independent of the specific values of $x$ and $y$ (as long as they satisfy the given proportionality and distinct non-zero conditions)."
