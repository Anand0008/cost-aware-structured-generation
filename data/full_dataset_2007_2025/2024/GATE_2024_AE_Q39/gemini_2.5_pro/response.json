The eccentricity is related to the specific mechanical energy ($E$) and specific angular momentum ($h$) by the formula $e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 E h^2}{\\mu^2}}$. The specific angular momentum is given by $h = rV\\cos\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the flight path angle (angle between velocity vector and local horizontal). Once $e$ is found, the trajectory is classified as circular ($e=0$), elliptic ($0 < e < 1$), parabolic ($e=1$), or hyperbolic ($e>1$).",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Directly yields the eccentricity, which is a fundamental orbital parameter. Cons: Requires knowing the flight path angle ($\\beta$), which is not provided in this specific question. If $\\beta$ is unknown, this method cannot be directly applied without making an assumption (e.g., tangential velocity, $\\beta=0$).",
          "when_to_use": "This method is preferred when the flight path angle is explicitly given or can be reasonably assumed (e.g., at apogee or perigee where $\\beta=0$). In the absence of $\\beta$, the specific energy method is more direct."
