The sign of \\(\\varepsilon\\) determines the conic: negative for ellipse (including circle), zero for parabola, positive for hyperbola. Given: altitude = 600 km, Earth radius = 6400 km, so \\(R = 7000\\,\\text{km} = 7.0\\times10^6\\,\\text{m}\\). Speed \\(V = 9\\,\\text{km/s} = 9.0\\times10^3\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Gravitational parameter \\(\\mu = GM_{Earth} = 3.98\\times10^{14}\\,\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2\\). Compute: \\(\\frac{V^2}{2} = \\frac{(9.0\\times10^3)^2}{2} = 4.05\\times10^7\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).

Thus \\(\\varepsilon = 4.05\\times10^7 - 5.6857\\times10^7 \\approx -1.64\\times10^7\\,\\text{J/kg} < 0\\). Negative specific energy means a bound orbit: elliptical (including circular). To distinguish circular from non-circular, compare given speed with circular speed at this radius: \\(V_c = \\sqrt{\\mu/R} = \\sqrt{5.6857\\times10^7} \\approx 7.54\\,\\text{km/s}\\). Since \\(V = 9\\,\\text{km/s} > V_c\\), the orbit is not circular; it is an ellipse with this point between perigee and apogee. Hence the trajectory is elliptic, matching option B."

Then compare the given speed V: if V = V_c, orbit is circular; if V_c < V < V_e, orbit is elliptic but non-circular; if V = V_e, parabolic; if V > V_e, hyperbolic.",

The detailed energy-based classification relied partly on internal knowledge."
