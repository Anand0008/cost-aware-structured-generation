          "Step 2: Recognize the structure of the solution. The general solution to this linear ODE is the sum of the complementary solution (solution to the homogeneous equation with $F(t)=0$) and a particular solution (a specific solution matching the form of the forcing function).",

For a damped system ($c>0$), the complementary solution has the form $x_c(t) = e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}(A \\cos(\\omega_d t) + B \\sin(\\omega_d t))$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio, $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency, and $\\omega_d$ is the damped natural frequency. The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by initial conditions.",
