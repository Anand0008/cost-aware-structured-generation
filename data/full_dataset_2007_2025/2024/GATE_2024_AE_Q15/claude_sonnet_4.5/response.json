Based on the retrieved knowledge, this decaying part of the motion is known as the transient response. The transient response depends on the initial conditions and decays over time due to damping, while the steady-state response persists indefinitely and is driven solely by the continuous forcing function. Therefore, the correct answer is A. transient response."
