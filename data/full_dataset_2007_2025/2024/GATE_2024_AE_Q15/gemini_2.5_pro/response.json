        "reasoning": "For a single degree of freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper system subjected to harmonic forcing, the total response is a superposition of two main parts: the transient response and the steady-state response. The transient response, also known as the homogeneous solution or free vibration part, depends on the system's initial conditions and contains an exponential decay term (e.g., $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$) due to the presence of damping. This term causes the amplitude of the transient motion to decrease over time, eventually decaying to zero. The steady-state response, or particular solution, is driven by the external harmonic force and persists indefinitely, oscillating at the forcing frequency without decay. Therefore, the part of the motion that decays due to damping is correctly identified as the transient response."

          "**Step 2: Recall the General Form of Response.** For such a system, the total displacement response $x(t)$ is generally composed of two parts: the complementary solution (or homogeneous solution, $x_h(t)$) and the particular solution (or forced solution, $x_p(t)$).",
          "**Step 3: Define Transient Response.** The complementary solution, $x_h(t)$, is known as the transient response. It arises from the system's initial conditions (initial displacement and velocity) and represents the system's natural tendency to vibrate. In a damped system, this part includes an exponential decay term, such as $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency. This term causes the transient vibrations to diminish over time.",
          "**Step 4: Define Steady-State Response.** The particular solution, $x_p(t)$, is known as the steady-state response. It is directly driven by the external harmonic forcing function and persists as long as the forcing is applied. It oscillates at the same frequency as the forcing function and does not decay.",
          "**Step 5: Identify the Decaying Part.** The question specifically asks for the part of the motion that 'decays due to damping'. Based on the definitions, this characteristic belongs exclusively to the transient response.",
          "**Step 6: Select the Correct Option.** Therefore, 'transient response' is the correct answer."
