The amplitude of the response varies as `$e^{\\sigma t}$$. We need to find the time `t` when the amplitude becomes half its initial value. Therefore, we set `$e^{\\sigma t} = 0.5$$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `$\\sigma t = \\ln(0.5)$$. Solving for `t`: `$t = \\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{\\sigma}$$. Substituting the given value of `$\\sigma$`: `$t = \\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{-0.039} = \\frac{-0.693147}{-0.039} \\approx 17.773$ s.
