        "reasoning": "The calculation proceeds by first determining the aircraft's weight (which equals lift in steady level flight) and the wing's aspect ratio. Then, dynamic pressure is calculated. These values are used to find the lift coefficient. Crucially, for an elliptic planform, the span efficiency factor (e) is 1. With all these parameters, the induced drag coefficient is calculated, and finally, the induced drag force is determined. All steps align with fundamental aerodynamic principles and the formulas provided in the RAG context (specifically Chunks 1, 4, and 6). The calculated value of 63.7 N falls within the acceptable range of 63.0 to 64.5 N."

For an elliptic wing planform, the lift distribution is ideally elliptic, which results in a constant induced angle of attack and minimum induced drag for a given lift and aspect ratio. For such a wing, the span efficiency factor ($e$) is 1.",

    "question_text": "An airplane of mass 1000 kg is in a steady level flight with a speed of 50 m/s. The wing has an elliptic planform with a span of 20 m and planform area 31.4 m^2. Assuming the density of air at that altitude to be 1 kg/m^3 and acceleration due to gravity to be 10 m/s^2, the induced drag on the wing is _________ N (rounded off to 1 decimal place)."
