      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the Inlet Conditions and Assumptions.** The problem specifies a centrifugal compressor inducer with a blade angle (relative to the tangential direction) of $\\beta_1 = 45^{\\circ}$ at the tip. The relative Mach number $M_{r1}$ is 1.0. The stagnation temperature of the incoming air $T_{01}$ is 300 K. Key assumptions are neglecting pre-whirl ($c_{t1} = 0$) and slip (not directly relevant for this calculation).",
          "**Step 2: Relate Blade Angle to Velocities (No Pre-Whirl).** With no pre-whirl, the absolute velocity $c_1$ is purely axial, so $c_1 = c_{f1}$ and $c_{t1} = 0$. From the velocity triangle at the inducer inlet, the blade angle $\\beta_1$ is related to the axial flow velocity $c_{f1}$ and the inducer tip speed $U_1$ by $\\tan \\beta_1 = \\frac{c_{f1}}{U_1}$. Given $\\beta_1 = 45^{\\circ}$, $\\tan 45^{\\circ} = 1$, which implies $c_{f1} = U_1$.",
          "**Step 3: Relate Relative Mach Number to Relative Velocity.** The relative Mach number is defined as $M_{r1} = \\frac{c_{r1}}{a_1}$, where $c_{r1}$ is the relative velocity and $a_1$ is the local speed of sound. Since $M_{r1} = 1.0$, it means $c_{r1} = a_1$.",
          "**Step 4: Connect Relative Velocity to Blade Speed.** From the velocity triangle, the relative velocity $c_{r1}$ is related to the axial flow velocity $c_{f1}$ and the inducer tip speed $U_1$ by $c_{r1}^2 = c_{f1}^2 + U_1^2$. Substituting $c_{f1} = U_1$ (from Step 2), we get $c_{r1}^2 = U_1^2 + U_1^2 = 2 U_1^2$. Therefore, $c_{r1} = \\sqrt{2} U_1$.",
          "**Step 5: Express Speed of Sound in terms of Static Temperature.** The local speed of sound for an ideal gas is given by $a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$, where $T_1$ is the static temperature at the inducer inlet, $\\gamma = 1.4$ (given), and $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg·K)}$ (specific gas constant for air).",
          "**Step 6: Formulate Equation for $U_1$ in terms of $T_1$.** Equating the expressions for $c_{r1}$ from Step 3 ($c_{r1} = a_1$) and Step 4 ($c_{r1} = \\sqrt{2} U_1$), we get $a_1 = \\sqrt{2} U_1$. Substituting the expression for $a_1$ from Step 5: $\\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1} = \\sqrt{2} U_1$. Squaring both sides gives $\\gamma R T_1 = 2 U_1^2$, which can be rearranged to find the static temperature: $T_1 = \\frac{2 U_1^2}{\\gamma R}$.",
          "**Step 7: Use Absolute Stagnation Temperature Relation.** The absolute stagnation temperature $T_{01}$ is related to the static temperature $T_1$ and the absolute velocity $c_1$ by $T_{01} = T_1 + \\frac{c_1^2}{2 C_p}$. Since there is no pre-whirl, $c_1 = c_{f1}$. From Step 2, $c_{f1} = U_1$. Also, the specific heat at constant pressure $C_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$. Substituting these, we get $T_{01} = T_1 + \\frac{U_1^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}\\right)} = T_1 + \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2 \\gamma R}$.",
          "**Step 8: Substitute and Solve for $U_1$.** Substitute the expression for $T_1$ from Step 6 into the equation from Step 7: \n$T_{01} = \\frac{2 U_1^2}{\\gamma R} + \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2 \\gamma R}$\n$T_{01} = \\frac{U_1^2}{\\gamma R} \\left(2 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2}\\right)$\n$T_{01} = \\frac{U_1^2}{\\gamma R} \\left(\\frac{4 + \\gamma - 1}{2}\\right)$\n$T_{01} = \\frac{U_1^2}{\\gamma R} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma + 3}{2}\\right)$\nSolving for $U_1$: $U_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma R T_{01}}{\\gamma + 3}}$.",
          "**Step 9: Calculate the Numerical Value.** Substitute the given values: $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg·K)}$, $T_{01} = 300 \\text{ K}$.\n$U_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1.4 \\times 287 \\times 300}{1.4 + 3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{241080}{4.4}} \\approx \\sqrt{54790.909} \\approx 234.07 \\text{ m/s}$.\nRounding off to the nearest integer, the inducer tip speed is $234 \\text{ m/s}$."
