        "reasoning": "The answer is derived from fundamental relationships for a centrifugal compressor inducer. With no pre-whirl, the absolute inlet flow is axial. The blade angle of 45° and relative Mach number of 1.0 provide two equations. Combining the velocity triangle geometry, definition of Mach number, and the relationship between stagnation and static temperature yields an equation for tip speed U1. Using standard air properties (R=287 J/kg·K, derived from γ=1.4 and Cp=1005 J/kg·K if needed), the calculation gives U1 ≈ 234 m/s, which lies within the provided answer key range (230 to 240)."

          "Step 1: Understand the given conditions. At the inducer tip, blade angle β1 = 45°, relative Mach number M_rel = 1.0, stagnation temperature T01 = 300 K, γ = 1.4. Neglect pre-whirl (so absolute tangential velocity c_t1 = 0) and slip.",
          "Step 2: Draw the inlet velocity triangle. With no pre-whirl, absolute velocity c1 is purely axial (c1 = c_a1). The tangential component of relative velocity is U1 - c_t1 = U1. So, tan(β1) = c1 / U1. Given β1 = 45°, we get c1 = U1.",
          "Step 3: Relate relative velocity w1 to U1 and c1. From the triangle, w1^2 = U1^2 + c1^2 = 2 U1^2 (since c1 = U1). Thus, w1 = U1√2.",
          "Step 4: Use the relative Mach number definition: M_rel = w1 / a1 = 1, where a1 = √(γ R T1) is the speed of sound based on static temperature T1. Therefore, w1 = √(γ R T1).",
          "Step 5: Relate static temperature T1 to stagnation temperature T01 using the energy equation: T01 = T1 + c1^2/(2Cp). Since c1 = U1, we have T1 = T01 - U1^2/(2Cp).",
          "Step 6: Combine equations. From steps 3 and 4: U1√2 = √(γ R T1). Square both sides: 2 U1^2 = γ R T1. Substitute T1 from step 5: 2 U1^2 = γ R [T01 - U1^2/(2Cp)].",
          "Step 7: Solve for U1^2. Rearrange: 2 U1^2 + (γ R U1^2)/(2Cp) = γ R T01 ⇒ U1^2 [2 + (γ R)/(2Cp)] = γ R T01. Use the thermodynamic relation Cp = γR/(γ-1) to simplify (γ R)/(2Cp) = (γ-1)/2. Thus, U1^2 [2 + (γ-1)/2] = U1^2 [(γ+3)/2] = γ R T01 ⇒ U1^2 = (2γ R T01)/(γ+3).",
          "Step 8: Plug numbers. γ=1.4, T01=300 K, R=287 J/kg·K (standard for air). Compute: γ+3=4.4, γR=1.4*287=401.8, numerator=2*401.8*300=241080, U1^2=241080/4.4≈54790.91, U1=√54790.91≈234.07 m/s. Round to nearest integer: 234 m/s."

Consider gamma = 1.4. Neglect pre-whirl and slip. The inducer tip speed is ________ m/s (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
