This means the pressure coefficient Cpl at the trailing edge will be less than 1 (Cpl < 1).\n\nFor the airfoil with a cusped trailing edge (II), the Kutta condition requires the flow to leave the trailing edge with zero velocity, which is a stagnation point. This means the pressure coefficient Cpll at the trailing edge will be 1 (Cpll = 1).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C: Cpl = 1, Cpll < 1."
