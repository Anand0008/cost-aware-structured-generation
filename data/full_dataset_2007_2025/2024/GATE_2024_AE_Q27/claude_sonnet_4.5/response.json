Maintaining directional control during crosswind landings: In crosswind conditions, the rudder is used to create a controlled sideslip, where the aircraft's fuselage is aligned with the runway while the wings are banked into the wind. This allows the aircraft to maintain a straight ground track despite the crosswind."
