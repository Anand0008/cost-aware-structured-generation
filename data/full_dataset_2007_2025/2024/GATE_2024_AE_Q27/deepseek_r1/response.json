C: The rudder is essential for maintaining runway alignment in crosswind landings (e.g., in the wing-low/sideslip method).

The rudder is applied in the direction of the turn to coordinate the turn and counteract this adverse yaw. This is a standard use.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Option B (yawing moment due to engine failure): In a multi-engine airplane, failure of one engine creates asymmetric thrust, generating a strong yawing moment towards the failed engine. The rudder must generate an opposing moment to maintain directional control. This is a critical design and operational application.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option C (landing in crosswind conditions): During a crosswind approach and landing, the pilot uses the rudder to align the aircraft's longitudinal axis with the runway centerline while using ailerons to prevent drift (wing-low method). This creates a controlled sideslip. The rudder is essential for this maneuver.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option D (enhancing longitudinal stability): Longitudinal stability pertains to pitch (angle of attack) and is governed by the horizontal tail, elevator, and aircraft CG location. The rudder, located on the vertical tail, primarily affects yaw (directional stability) and sideslip. It does not directly enhance longitudinal stability; thus, this option is incorrect.",
