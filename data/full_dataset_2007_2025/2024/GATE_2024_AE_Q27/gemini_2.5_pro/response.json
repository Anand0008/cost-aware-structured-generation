        "reasoning": "The question is a Multiple Select Question (MSQ) asking about the uses of a rudder in a conventional aircraft. Based on fundamental principles of flight mechanics and control, and corroborated by the provided RAG context:\n\n*   **Option A: to overcome adverse yaw during a turning maneuver.** This is a primary function of the rudder. When ailerons are deflected to initiate a roll, they often create differential drag, leading to a yawing moment in the opposite direction of the desired turn (adverse yaw). The rudder is used to counteract this adverse yaw, coordinating the turn and preventing sideslip. (Refer to CHUNK 2)\n\n*   **Option B: to overcome yawing moment due to failure of one engine in a multi engine airplane.** In multi-engine aircraft, an engine failure creates asymmetric thrust, generating a significant yawing moment that tries to turn the aircraft towards the inoperative engine. The rudder is crucial for generating an opposing yawing moment to maintain directional control and straight flight. (Refer to CHUNK 1, CHUNK 4, CHUNK 6)\n\n*   **Option C: for landing the airplane in crosswind conditions.** During crosswind landings, pilots use the rudder (often in conjunction with ailerons in a 'wing-low' or 'sideslip' method) to align the aircraft's longitudinal axis with the runway centerline while maintaining a straight ground track. The rudder creates a sideslip angle to counteract the crosswind drift. (Refer to CHUNK 1, CHUNK 3, CHUNK 4)\n\n*   **Option D: for enhancing longitudinal stability.** Longitudinal stability relates to an aircraft's pitching motion and is primarily governed by the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The rudder, located on the vertical stabilizer, primarily controls directional (yaw) stability. While there can be some aerodynamic coupling, enhancing longitudinal stability is not its primary or direct function. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAll options A, B, and C describe valid and critical applications of the rudder in aircraft control."
