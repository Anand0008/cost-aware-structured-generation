          "Step 1: Identify the control volume and assumptions. The CV includes surfaces 1 (inflow), 4 (outflow), and streamlines 2 and 3. Flow is incompressible, steady, 2D. Static pressure p_inf is constant over the entire CV surface.",
          "Step 2: Apply the x-momentum conservation to the CV. The net force on the fluid in the x-direction equals the net momentum flux out. Forces: pressure forces cancel because p_inf is constant (integral of constant pressure over closed surface is zero). The airfoil exerts a force -D on the fluid (drag force on airfoil is D). So, -D = Net momentum flux out.",
          "Step 3: Compute net momentum flux. Only surfaces 1 and 4 contribute (since 2 and 3 are streamlines with no mass flux). Let u1(y) be velocity profile at surface 1, u4(y) at surface 4. Then, momentum flux out = ∫_4 ρ u4^2 dy - ∫_1 ρ u1^2 dy. Thus, -D = ρ (∫_4 u4^2 dy - ∫_1 u1^2 dy) ⇒ D = ρ (∫_1 u1^2 dy - ∫_4 u4^2 dy).",

Define momentum thickness θ = ∫ (u4/U_inf)(1 - u4/U_inf) dy. It can be shown that D = ρ U_inf^2 θ. (Derivation: D = ρ ∫ (U_inf^2 - u4^2) dy = ρ U_inf^2 ∫ (1 - (u4/U_inf)^2) dy. Using mass conservation, this equals ρ U_inf^2 ∫ (u4/U_inf)(1 - u4/U_inf) dy = ρ U_inf^2 θ.)",

However, the RAG did not contain the specific velocity profiles or numerical data from the figure needed for the actual computation. Therefore, internal knowledge was used to complete the solution methodology and provide the expected answer range."

Velocity profiles are measured at the upstream end (surface 1) and at the downstream end (surface 4) of the control volume. The drag coefficient for the airfoil is defined as Cd = D / (0.5 rho U_inf^2 c), where D is the drag force on the airfoil per unit span and rho is the density of the air. The static pressure, p_inf, is constant over the entire surface of the control volume. Assuming the flow to be incompressible, two-dimensional and steady, the Cd for the airfoil is _________ (rounded off to 3 decimal places)."
