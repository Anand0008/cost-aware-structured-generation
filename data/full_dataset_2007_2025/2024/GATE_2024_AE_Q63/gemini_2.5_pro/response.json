        "reasoning": "The drag force per unit span ($D$) on the airfoil can be determined using the integral momentum equation applied to the control volume. Given that the static pressure $p_{\\infty}$ is constant over the entire control volume, the drag force is solely due to the momentum deficit in the wake. The formula for drag per unit span for incompressible, steady, two-dimensional flow with constant far-field pressure is $D = \\int \\rho u (U_{\\infty} - u) dy$, where $u$ is the local velocity in the wake and $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity.\n\nThe velocity profile at the downstream end (surface 4) is given as $u(y) = (y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $0 \\le y \\le H_D$ and $u(y) = (-y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $-H_D \\le y < 0$. This means the velocity varies linearly from $0$ at the center of the wake ($y=0$) to $U_{\\infty}$ at the edges ($y=\\pm H_D$).\n\nThe integral can be evaluated as:\n$D = \\int_{-H_D}^{H_D} \\rho u(y) (U_{\\infty} - u(y)) dy$\nDue to symmetry, this can be written as:\n$D = 2 \\int_{0}^{H_D} \\rho (y/H_D) U_{\\infty} (U_{\\infty} - (y/H_D) U_{\\infty}) dy$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 \\int_{0}^{H_D} (y/H_D) (1 - y/H_D) dy$\nLet $\\eta = y/H_D$, so $dy = H_D d\\eta$. The limits change from $0$ to $1$.\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D \\int_{0}^{1} (\\eta - \\eta^2) d\\eta$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D [\\frac{\\eta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\eta^3}{3}]_{0}^{1}$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3})$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D (\\frac{1}{6})$\n$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D$\n\nGiven $H_D = 0.03c$:\n$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 (0.03c) = 0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c$\n\nThe drag coefficient $C_d$ is defined as $C_d = D / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c)$.\n$C_d = (0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) = 0.01 / 0.5 = 0.02$.\n\nRounded off to 3 decimal places, $C_d = 0.020$."

For incompressible, steady, two-dimensional flow with constant pressure on the control surface, the drag per unit span ($D$) is given by $D = \\int \\rho u (U_{\\infty} - u) dy$, where $u$ is the local velocity in the wake and $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity.",
