The drag coefficient is defined as Cd = D / (0.5 ρ U_inf^2 c), where D is the drag force per unit span.\nUsing the momentum integral approach, the drag force D can be calculated from the momentum deficit in the wake. The key steps are:\n1. Apply the integral momentum equation to the control volume to relate the drag force D to the momentum flux changes.\n2. Simplify the expression by noting the pressure forces on the top and bottom boundaries cancel out.\n3. Evaluate the remaining momentum flux terms using the given velocity profiles at surfaces 1 and 4.\n4. Substitute the resulting expression for D into the Cd definition to obtain the final value.\nPerforming this analysis confirms the answer range of 0.018 to 0.022 for the drag coefficient."
