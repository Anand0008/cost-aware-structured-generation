        "reasoning": "The fuel-air ratio ($f$) in a gas turbine engine combustor is determined by an energy balance. The problem states that the fuel-air ratio $f << 1.0$, which implies a common simplification in the energy balance equation. In this simplified approach, the energy released by the fuel is considered to primarily increase the enthalpy of the incoming air, neglecting the enthalpy contribution of the fuel mass itself in the exhaust products. Also, 100% burner efficiency ($\\eta_b = 1.0$) and constant specific heat ($C_p$) for both air and burned gases are given.\n\nThe simplified energy balance equation for the combustor is:\n$\\dot{m}_a C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) = \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\dot{m}_a$ is the mass flow rate of air (kg/s)\n*   $\\dot{m}_f$ is the mass flow rate of fuel (kg/s)\n*   $C_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure (J/(kg K))\n*   $T_{t3}$ is the combustor inlet stagnation temperature (K)\n*   $T_{t4}$ is the combustor exit stagnation temperature (K)\n*   $Q_R$ is the heating value of the fuel (J/kg)\n*   $\\eta_b$ is the burner efficiency (dimensionless)\n\nThe fuel-air ratio is defined as $f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$. Dividing the energy balance equation by $\\dot{m}_a$ and rearranging for $f$:\n$f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3})}{Q_R \\eta_b}$\n\nGiven values:\n*   $T_{t3} = 600$ K\n*   $T_{t4} = 1300$ K\n*   $C_p = 1100$ J/(kg K)\n*   $Q_R = 43.4 \\times 10^6$ J/kg\n*   $\\eta_b = 1.0$ (100% burner efficiency)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$f = \\frac{1100 \\text{ J/(kg K)} \\times (1300 \\text{ K} - 600 \\text{ K})}{43.4 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg} \\times 1.0}$\n$f = \\frac{1100 \\times 700}{43400000}$\n$f = \\frac{770000}{43400000}$\n$f \\approx 0.01774193$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, $f \\approx 0.0177$.

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters for the combustor: inlet temperature ($T_{t3} = 600$ K), exit temperature ($T_{t4} = 1300$ K), specific heat ($C_p = 1100$ J/(kg K)), heating value of fuel ($Q_R = 43.4 \\times 10^6$ J/kg), and burner efficiency ($\\eta_b = 1.0$). Note the critical assumption $f << 1.0$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the energy balance principle for a combustor. The energy released by burning fuel is transferred to the air, increasing its enthalpy. Given the assumption $f << 1.0$, the mass of fuel added is considered negligible compared to the air mass flow rate for the enthalpy change of the gas mixture. This simplifies the energy balance to: $\\dot{m}_a C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) = \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b$.",
          "Step 3: Define the fuel-air ratio as $f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$. Rearrange the simplified energy balance equation to solve for $f$: Divide both sides by $\\dot{m}_a$ to get $C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a} Q_R \\eta_b$, which simplifies to $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3})}{Q_R \\eta_b}$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the numerical values into the derived formula. Ensure all units are consistent (Joules, kilograms, Kelvin).",
          "Step 5: Perform the calculation: $f = \\frac{1100 \\times (1300 - 600)}{43.4 \\times 10^6 \\times 1.0} = \\frac{1100 \\times 700}{43400000} = \\frac{770000}{43400000} \\approx 0.0177419$.",

          "description": "This method uses the more general energy balance equation that accounts for the enthalpy of the fuel mass in the exhaust products: $f = \\frac{C_{p,gas} T_{t4} - C_{p,air} T_{t3}}{Q_R \\eta_b - C_{p,gas} T_{t4}}$. If $C_{p,air} = C_{p,gas} = C_p$, it simplifies to $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3})}{Q_R \\eta_b - C_p T_{t4}}$.",
