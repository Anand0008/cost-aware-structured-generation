The orbital period of a geostationary satellite is exactly 24 hours, matching the Earth's rotation period, which makes the satellite appear stationary from a fixed point on Earth's surface. Options C and D are incorrect, as the orbital period of a geostationary satellite is not 90 minutes, and it is not visible from all parts of the Earth (it only covers about 42% of the Earth's surface)."
