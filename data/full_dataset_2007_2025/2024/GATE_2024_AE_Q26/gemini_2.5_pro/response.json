        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify correct statements regarding a satellite in a geostationary orbit. Based on the fundamental definitions of a geostationary orbit, as consistently provided in the retrieved knowledge:\n\n*   **Option A: The orbit lies in the equatorial plane.** This is a defining characteristic of a geostationary orbit. For a satellite to appear stationary from Earth's surface, its orbit must have zero inclination, meaning it must be directly above the Earth's equator. This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n*   **Option B: The orbit is circular about the center of the Earth.** A geostationary orbit is a specific type of geosynchronous orbit that is circular (i.e., has zero eccentricity). This ensures a constant orbital speed and radius, which is necessary for the satellite to remain fixed relative to a point on the Earth's surface. This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n*   **Option C: The time period of motion is 90 minutes.** A geostationary orbit has an orbital period equal to Earth's sidereal rotation period, which is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds (or roughly 86164.1 seconds, or approximately 24 hours for practical purposes). A period of 90 minutes (1.5 hours) is characteristic of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), not a geostationary orbit. This contradicts information in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n*   **Option D: The satellite is visible from all parts of the Earth.** Geostationary satellites provide continuous coverage to a large fixed area, but their coverage is limited. They cannot cover the polar regions or areas at very high latitudes. RAG Chunks 3 and 4 explicitly state that geostationary satellites are 'limited in their coverage to about 42% of Earth's surface' and that 'a network of at least three such satellites is needed for near-global coverage (excluding polar regions)'. Therefore, a single geostationary satellite is not visible from all parts of the Earth.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A and B are correct."

          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C. 'The time period of motion is 90 minutes.' The orbital period for a geostationary orbit is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds (one sidereal day), not 90 minutes. 90 minutes is typical for a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Thus, statement C is incorrect.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D. 'The satellite is visible from all parts of the Earth.' A single geostationary satellite can only cover approximately 42% of the Earth's surface and cannot cover the polar regions. Multiple satellites are needed for near-global coverage.
