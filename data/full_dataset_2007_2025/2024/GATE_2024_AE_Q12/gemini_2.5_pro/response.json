        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the given acceleration function and the goal. The acceleration is $a = -C_1 - C_2v^2$, and we need to find the distance $x$ when the body comes to rest (i.e., $v=0$) starting from an initial velocity $v_0$.",
          "Step 2: Relate acceleration, velocity, and displacement. Since acceleration is given as a function of velocity, and we need to find displacement, the appropriate kinematic relation is $a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$.",
          "Step 3: Substitute the given acceleration into the kinematic relation: $v \\frac{dv}{dx} = -C_1 - C_2v^2$.",
          "Step 4: Separate the variables to prepare for integration. Rearrange the equation to isolate $dx$ on one side and terms involving $v$ and $dv$ on the other: $dx = \\frac{v}{-C_1 - C_2v^2} dv$.",
          "Step 5: Set up the definite integral. The body starts at $x=0$ with velocity $v_0$ and comes to rest ($v=0$) at a distance $x$. So, integrate $dx$ from $0$ to $x$ and the velocity term from $v_0$ to $0$: $$\\int_{0}^{x} dx = \\int_{v_0}^{0} \\frac{v}{-C_1 - C_2v^2} dv$$",
          "Step 6: Solve the integral. For the right-hand side, use a substitution. Let $u = C_1 + C_2v^2$. Then, $du = 2C_2v \\, dv$, which means $v \\, dv = \\frac{du}{2C_2}$. The integral becomes: $$\\int_{v_0}^{0} \\frac{1}{-(C_1 + C_2v^2)} \\left(\\frac{du}{2C_2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2C_2} \\int_{v_0}^{0} \\frac{1}{u} du$$",
          "Step 7: Evaluate the integral. The integral of $\\frac{1}{u}$ is $\\ln|u|$. So, $$\\left[x\\right]_{0}^{x} = -\\frac{1}{2C_2} \\left[\\ln(C_1 + C_2v^2)\\right]_{v_0}^{0}$$",
          "Step 8: Apply the limits of integration. $$\\begin{aligned} x - 0 &= -\\frac{1}{2C_2} [\\ln(C_1 + C_2(0)^2) - \\ln(C_1 + C_2v_0^2)] \\ x &= -\\frac{1}{2C_2} [\\ln(C_1) - \\ln(C_1 + C_2v_0^2)] \\ x &= -\\frac{1}{2C_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_1 + C_2v_0^2}\\right) \\end{aligned}$$",
          "Step 9: Simplify using logarithm properties. $$\\begin{aligned} x &= \\frac{1}{2C_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1 + C_2v_0^2}{C_1}\\right) \\ x &= \\frac{1}{2C_2} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{C_2}{C_1}v_0^2\\right) \\end{aligned}$$ This matches option A."
