        "reasoning": "For an isotropic, homogeneous, and linearly elastic material, the stress-strain relationship can be expressed using two independent elastic constants. These are commonly Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio ($\\nu$), or equivalently, the Lamé constants ($\\lambda$ and $\\mu$). The generalized Hooke's Law in terms of Lamé constants is given by:\n$\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\epsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{ij}$\n\nExpanding this for normal stresses in Cartesian coordinates, for example, for $\\sigma_x$:\n$\\sigma_x = \\lambda (\\epsilon_x + \\epsilon_y + \\epsilon_z) + 2\\mu \\epsilon_x = (\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\epsilon_x + \\lambda \\epsilon_y + \\lambda \\epsilon_z$\nSimilarly for $\\sigma_y$ and $\\sigma_z$.\n\nFor shear stresses:\n$\\tau_{xy} = 2\\mu \\epsilon_{xy} = \\mu \\gamma_{xy}$\nAnd similarly for $\\tau_{yz}$ and $\\tau_{zx}$.\n\nThe question states that P, Q, and R are the three elastic constants in the given (unspecified) stress-strain relationship. Since an isotropic material fundamentally has only two independent elastic constants, P, Q, and R must be related. A common convention for the coefficients in these constitutive equations, when expressed in terms of Lamé constants, is:\n$P = \\lambda + 2\\mu$\n$Q = \\lambda$\n$R = \\mu$ (where $\\mu$ is also the shear modulus G)\n\nNow, let's check the given options with these assignments:\n\nA. $R = \\frac{P - Q}{2}$\n   Substituting the expressions for P, Q, and R:\n   $\\mu = \\frac{(\\lambda + 2\\mu) - \\lambda}{2}$\n   $\\mu = \\frac{2\\mu}{2}$\n   $\\mu = \\mu$\n   This relationship is consistent and holds true.\n\nLet's quickly check other options to confirm they are incorrect:\nB. $R = \\frac{Q - P}{2} \\implies \\mu = \\frac{\\lambda - (\\lambda + 2\\mu)}{2} = \\frac{-2\\mu}{2} = -\\mu$, which is incorrect as elastic constants are positive.\nC. $Q = \\frac{P - R}{2} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{(\\lambda + 2\\mu) - \\mu}{2} = \\frac{\\lambda + \\mu}{2} \\implies 2\\lambda = \\lambda + \\mu \\implies \\lambda = \\mu$, which is not generally true for isotropic materials.\nD. $Q = \\frac{R - P}{2} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{\\mu - (\\lambda + 2\\mu)}{2} = \\frac{-\\lambda - \\mu}{2} \\implies 2\\lambda = -\\lambda - \\mu \\implies 3\\lambda = -\\mu$, which is incorrect as elastic constants are positive.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct relationship between the elastic constants P, Q, and R, assuming they correspond to the standard coefficients in the isotropic stress-strain constitutive equations."

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent context on Generalized Hooke's Law, Lamé constants, and the interrelationship between E, G, and $\\nu$ for isotropic materials. This was crucial for identifying the standard forms of the elastic constants and verifying the relationship. The only missing piece was the explicit form of the stress-strain relationship in terms of P, Q, R, but this was inferable from the context of 'three elastic constants' for an isotropic material."
