        "reasoning": "Area of the rectangular sheet is its surface area: 54 cm \\(\\times\\) 4 cm = 216 cm\\(^2\\). This equals the total surface area of the cube: \\(6a^2 = 216\\Rightarrow a^2 = 36\\Rightarrow a = 6\\) cm. Volume of cube: \\(V_{cube} = a^3 = 6^3 = 216\\) cm\\(^3\\). For the cylinder, the longer edges (54 cm) are joined, so this becomes the circumference: \\(2\\pi r = 54\\Rightarrow r = 27/\\pi\\) cm, and height \\(h = 4\\) cm. Volume of cylinder: \\(V_{cyl} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (27/\\pi)^2 \\cdot 4 = \\pi \\cdot 729/\\pi^2 \\cdot 4 = 2916/\\pi\\) cm\\(^3\\). Ratio: \\(V_{cyl}/V_{cube} = (2916/\\pi)/216 = 2916/(216\\pi) = 13.5/\\pi = 27/(2\\pi)\\). This simplifies numerically to \\(\\approx 4.297/\\pi\\), which is not of the form given. Rechecking: 2916/216 = 13.5 = 27/2, so ratio is \\(27/(2\\pi)\\). However, the options are 1/\\(\\pi\\), 2/\\(\\pi\\), 3/\\(\\pi\\), 4/\\(\\pi\\). This suggests we misinterpreted which side becomes circumference. If instead the 4 cm side is joined to form the circumference: \\(2\\pi r = 4\\Rightarrow r = 2/\\pi\\) cm, height \\(h = 54\\) cm. Then \\(V_{cyl} = \\pi (2/\\pi)^2 \\cdot 54 = \\pi \\cdot 4/\\pi^2 \\cdot 54 = 216/\\pi\\) cm\\(^3\\). Ratio: \\(V_{cyl}/V_{cube} = (216/\\pi)/216 = 1/\\pi\\). This matches option A and is consistent with the phrase \"two longer edges are joined\" meaning the 54 cm edges are joined along their length, making the 4 cm side the circumference. Thus the official answer A is correct."
