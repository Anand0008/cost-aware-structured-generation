        "reasoning": "The analogy is based on increasing intensity. The sequence 'dry → arid → parched' shows increasing levels of dryness: 'dry' (somewhat dry), 'arid' (very dry, like a desert), and 'parched' (extremely dry). The sequence 'diet → fast → ________' should follow a similar pattern of increasing intensity related to food intake. 'Diet' implies reduced food intake, 'fast' implies complete abstention from food for a period, which is more intense. The next logical step of even greater intensity would be 'starve', which means to suffer or die from extreme lack of food. Options B ('reject'), C ('feast'), and D ('deny') do not fit this progression of intensity regarding food deprivation."

          "Step 4: Apply the same relationship to the second sequence: [diet → fast → ________]. The words are related to food intake. 'Diet' suggests controlled eating, often with reduced intake. 'Fast' means to abstain from all or some food for a period, which is more intense than a diet.",
          "Step 5: Determine the word that represents a further intensification of 'fast'. Consider the options: 'starve' (to suffer from extreme hunger, potentially to death), 'reject' (to refuse, not specific to food), 'feast' (to eat copiously - opposite direction), 'deny' (to refuse, not specific).",
          "Step 6: Select 'starve' as it correctly continues the progression of increasing severity of food deprivation, analogous to the progression from dry to parched."
