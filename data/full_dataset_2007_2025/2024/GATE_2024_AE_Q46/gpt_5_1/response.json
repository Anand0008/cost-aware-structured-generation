The Tresca criterion leads to a hexagon in the full \\sigma_1-\\sigma_2 plane (RAG Chunks 1,2), but when only the first and fourth quadrants are emphasized or drawn with rounded corners, it appears as a locus with straight segments aligned with \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_Y, \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_Y, and \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_Y. In the given figure, Criterion P is a smooth, closed, nearly elliptical curve symmetric about the line \\sigma_I = \\sigma_{II}, matching the von Mises ellipse. Criterion Q is a more polygonal, piecewise-linear-like curve that touches the axes at \\sigma_I = \\sigma_Y and \\sigma_{II} = \\sigma_Y and has flatter portions, consistent with the Tresca locus.
