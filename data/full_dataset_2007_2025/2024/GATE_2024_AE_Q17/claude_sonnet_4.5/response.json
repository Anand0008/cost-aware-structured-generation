To find the stoichiometric air requirement 'a', we use the oxygen balance:\n   2a = 2(10) + 12/2 = 22\n   Solving, a = 22/2 = 11\n4. The total moles of dry air per mole of fuel is:\n   (A/F)_stoich,molar = a(1 + 3.76) = 11 * 4.76 = 52.36 mol air/mol fuel\n5. Converting to mass basis:\n   (A/F)_stoich,mass = (52.36 * 28.97) / 132.22 = 11.9 kg air/kg fuel\n6. Since the question asks for moles of dry air, the final answer is 52.36 mol air."
