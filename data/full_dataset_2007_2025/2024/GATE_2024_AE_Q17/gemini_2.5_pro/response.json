        "reasoning": "The question asks for the moles of dry air required for the stoichiometric combustion of 1 mole of `C10H12`. The general stoichiometric combustion equation for a hydrocarbon `C_x H_y` with dry air (approximated as 1 mole O2 for 3.76 moles N2) is: \\n`C_x H_y + a(O_2 + 3.76 N_2) \\rightarrow xCO_2 + (y/2)H_2O + 3.76a N_2`\\n\\nFor `C10H12`, we have `x = 10` and `y = 12`. \\n\\n1.  **Balance Oxygen atoms to find 'a' (moles of O2 required):**\\n    The total number of oxygen atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\\n    Reactant O atoms: `2a`\\n    Product O atoms: `2x` (from `xCO2`) + `y/2` (from `(y/2)H2O`)\\n    So, `2a = 2x + y/2`\\n    Substitute `x = 10` and `y = 12`:\\n    `2a = 2(10) + 12/2`\\n    `2a = 20 + 6`\\n    `2a = 26`\\n    `a = 13` moles of `O2`\\n\\n2.  **Calculate total moles of dry air:**\\n    Dry air is composed of 21% O2 and 79% N2 by volume (or mole fraction). This means for every 1 mole of O2, there are `79/21 \\approx 3.76` moles of N2. \\n    Therefore, 1 mole of O2 is accompanied by `3.76` moles of N2, making a total of `1 + 3.76 = 4.76` moles of dry air per mole of O2.\\n\\n    Since `a = 13` moles of O2 are required, the total moles of dry air needed are:\\n    Moles of dry air = `a \\times (1 + 3.76)`\\n    Moles of dry air = `13 \\times 4.76`\\n    Moles of dry air = `61.88`\\n\\nRounding to one decimal place, the answer is `61.9` moles of dry air. This matches option A."
