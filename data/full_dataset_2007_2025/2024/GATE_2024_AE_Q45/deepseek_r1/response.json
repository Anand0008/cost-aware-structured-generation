For all other x, f is polynomial and continuous. Thus, f is continuous for all x (A correct, D incorrect). The left-hand derivative at 0 is 0, and the right-hand derivative is 1; since they differ, f is not differentiable at 0. The derivative function f'(x) is defined piecewise: f'(x)=2x for x<0 and f'(x)=1 for x>0. At x=0, f' does not exist. The left limit of f' as x→0- is 0, and the right limit is 1, so the derivative function has a jump discontinuity at 0 (B correct). At x=1, f'(x)=1, which is constant and hence continuous (C correct)."
