        "reasoning": "The problem involves determining the internal force in a member of a frame structure. Member BC is a two-force member, meaning the force within it acts purely along its axis. Member AD is a multi-force member (a beam) due to the applied external load at D and the connection to BC at C. To find the force in BC, we isolate member AD and apply the equations of static equilibrium. By taking moments about point A (a pin support on member AD), we can eliminate the reaction forces at A from the moment equation, simplifying the calculation to directly solve for the force in BC. The calculation yields a magnitude of 141.4 N, which falls within the specified range of 141.0 to 141.5. The negative sign indicates compression, but the question asks for magnitude."
