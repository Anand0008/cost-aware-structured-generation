Based on common GATE truss problems and the provided image description hinting at a short vertical distance (0.5 m) relative to a longer span (5 m), a configuration yielding a 45° angle is plausible. The solution uses equilibrium at a joint with a vertical load of 100 N and member BC at 45°, giving $F_{BC} = 100 / \\sin(45^\\circ) = 100\\sqrt{2}$ N."
