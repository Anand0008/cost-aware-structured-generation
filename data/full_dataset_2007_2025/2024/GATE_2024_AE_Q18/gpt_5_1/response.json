        "reasoning": "The diagram is a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) plot. For an ideal gas: (1) An isentropic process has constant entropy, so it appears as a vertical line on a T-s diagram. Curve bb' is vertical, so it must be isentropic. (2) An isothermal process has constant temperature, so it appears as a horizontal line on a T-s diagram. Curve aa' is horizontal, so it must be isothermal. (3) For an ideal gas, at constant pressure, using $T ds = c_p dT$ (since $dP=0$), we get $ds = \\frac{c_p}{T} dT$, which integrates to $s = c_p \\ln T + \\text{const}$, i.e., $T$ increases exponentially with $s$; this is a positively sloped curve that is less steep than the constant-volume curve. (4) At constant volume, $T ds = c_v dT + R T \\frac{dV}{V}$ with $dV=0$ gives $ds = \\frac{c_v}{T} dT$, so $s = c_v \\ln T + \\text{const}$. Since $c_p > c_v$, the isobaric curve (coefficient $c_p$) is steeper in $s$ vs $\\ln T$; equivalently, on a T-s diagram, the isochoric curve is less steep than the isobaric one for the same temperature range. In the given figure, cc' is the more gently rising curve and dd' is the steeper one. Standard convention for ideal gases on T-s diagrams is that the constant-pressure line is steeper than the constant-volume line. Thus cc' corresponds to isobaric and dd' to isochoric. Combining all, we get: aa' – isothermal, bb' – isentropic, cc' – isobaric, dd' – isochoric, which matches option C."
