(2) Isentropic process has constant entropy, represented by a vertical line. (3) Isobaric process: For an ideal gas, T increases exponentially with S at constant pressure; the curve has a positive slope given by dT/dS = T/Cp. (4) Isochoric process: Similarly, T increases exponentially with S at constant volume, but with a steeper slope dT/dS = T/Cv. Since Cv < Cp for ideal gases, the isochoric curve is steeper than the isobaric curve at the same state point. In the typical T-S diagram, the isobaric and isochoric curves are both increasing but with different slopes. Option C correctly matches aa' (horizontal) to isothermal, bb' (vertical) to isentropic, cc' (less steep increasing curve) to isobaric, and dd' (steeper increasing curve) to isochoric."

For constant volume, ds = Cv * dT/T, so T = T0 * exp((s-s0)/Cv).",

The chunks were more focused on P-v diagrams and general definitions. Therefore, internal knowledge was used to recall the exact shapes on T-S diagram (horizontal, vertical, slopes)."
