The altitude corresponding to absolute ceiling is higher than that for service ceiling:\nThe absolute ceiling is the highest altitude at which the aircraft can sustain steady, level flight, where the maximum rate of climb is 0 ft/min. The service ceiling is a lower altitude where the maximum rate of climb is 100 ft/min. Therefore, the altitude for absolute ceiling is higher than the service ceiling.\n\nB. At the absolute ceiling, the power required for cruise equals the maximum power available:\nAt the absolute ceiling, the maximum excess power available to the aircraft is zero, meaning the power required to maintain level flight equals the maximum power the engine can produce. This is the defining condition for the absolute ceiling."
