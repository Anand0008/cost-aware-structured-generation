        "reasoning": "The analysis confirms that statements A and B are correct based on the standard definitions of absolute and service ceilings in aircraft performance:\n\n1.  **Absolute Ceiling:** This is the highest theoretical altitude at which an aircraft can sustain steady, level flight. At this altitude, the maximum rate of climb (ROC) is 0 ft/min. This implies that the maximum power available from the engine is exactly equal to the power required to overcome drag and maintain level flight. There is no excess power for climbing.\n2.  **Service Ceiling:** This is a more practical operational altitude limit. For piston-propeller aircraft (as specified in the question), the service ceiling is defined as the altitude at which the maximum rate of climb (ROC) is 100 ft/min. For jet aircraft, it is typically 500 ft/min.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n*   **A. The altitude corresponding to absolute ceiling is higher than that for service ceiling.** This is correct. Since the absolute ceiling is where ROC = 0 ft/min and the service ceiling is where ROC = 100 ft/min (a positive climb rate), the absolute ceiling must be at a higher altitude where the aircraft's climb capability diminishes to zero.\n*   **B. At the absolute ceiling, the power required for cruise equals the maximum power available.** This is correct. As defined, at the absolute ceiling, the excess power is zero, meaning $P_{\\text{available}} - P_{\\text{required}} = 0$, or $P_{\\text{available}} = P_{\\text{required}}$.\n*   **C. The altitude corresponding to absolute ceiling is lower than that for service ceiling.** This is incorrect, as it contradicts statement A and the fundamental definitions.\n*   **D. At the service ceiling, the maximum rate of climb is 50 ft/min.** This is incorrect. For a piston-propeller aircraft, the standard definition of service ceiling specifies a maximum rate of climb of 100 ft/min, not 50 ft/min."
