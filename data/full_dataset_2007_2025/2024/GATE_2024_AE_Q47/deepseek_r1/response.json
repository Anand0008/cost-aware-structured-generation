As altitude increases, ROC decreases, so the altitude for ROC=0 is higher than for ROC=100. Statement B is correct: At the absolute ceiling, the maximum rate of climb is zero, which occurs when the power available from the engine equals the power required to maintain steady, level flight. Statement C is the opposite of A and is false. Statement D is false: For a piston-propeller aircraft, the service ceiling is defined by a maximum ROC of 100 ft/min, not 50 ft/min."
