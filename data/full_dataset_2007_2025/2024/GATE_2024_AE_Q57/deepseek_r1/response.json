However, the question is a simple numerical application, so the RAG context was supportive but not essential for solving. No chunk provided the exact formula rearrangement needed, but the principles were covered."

The specific impulse of the rocket is 200 s and acceleration due to gravity at the sea level is 9.8 m/s^2. The propellent mass flow rate out of the rocket nozzle is _________ kg/s (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
