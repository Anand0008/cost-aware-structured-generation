        "reasoning": "The forces acting parallel (longitudinal) to the direction of motion during ground roll are derived from Newton's second law. From the RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4), the longitudinal equation of motion is: $T - D - \\mu_r (W - L) = (W/g) * a$. The terms on the left are the forces parallel to motion: Thrust ($T$) forward, Drag ($D$) backward, and the Frictional force $\\mu_r (W - L)$ backward. The frictional force depends on the coefficient of rolling friction ($\\mu_r$) and the net normal force ($R = W - L$). Since $R$ includes Weight ($W$) and Lift ($L$), the frictional force is indeed a 'part of both weight and lift' acting parallel to motion. Therefore, all forces listed in option D are present."
