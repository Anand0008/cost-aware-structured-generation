        "reasoning": "The elevator is the primary control surface for longitudinal control, generating pitching moments. Its effectiveness ($C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$) quantifies how much pitching moment it can produce for a given deflection. When the center of gravity (CG) is moved forward, the aircraft becomes more statically stable, which means it develops a larger nose-down pitching moment for a given angle of attack. To trim the aircraft (i.e., achieve zero pitching moment) or to perform maneuvers requiring nose-up moments (like flaring for landing at high lift coefficients), the elevator must generate a sufficient nose-up pitching moment to counteract this inherent nose-down moment. If the CG is too far forward, even with maximum elevator deflection, the elevator might not be able to generate enough nose-up moment to achieve trim or control. Therefore, the elevator's control effectiveness directly limits how far forward the CG can be placed while maintaining adequate control authority for trimming and maneuvering. The aft-most CG location, conversely, is determined by static stability requirements (i.e., the CG must remain ahead of the neutral point for positive static margin), which is largely independent of elevator effectiveness."

          "Step 1: Understand Elevator Control Effectiveness. This refers to the sensitivity of the aircraft's pitching moment to elevator deflection. It is quantified by the derivative $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$, where a larger absolute value indicates a more effective elevator (Chunk 1, 3).",
          "Step 2: Recall the effect of Center of Gravity (CG) position on pitching moments. A forward CG position increases the aircraft's static longitudinal stability, leading to a larger inherent nose-down pitching moment for a given angle of attack (Chunk 2, 4).",
          "Step 3: Consider the requirement for trimming the aircraft. For safe flight, the aircraft must be trimmable (zero net pitching moment) across its operational envelope, including conditions requiring significant nose-up moments, such as during landing flare at high lift coefficients.",
          "Step 4: Relate elevator effectiveness to control authority. The maximum nose-up pitching moment an elevator can generate is limited by its maximum deflection and its control effectiveness. If the CG is too far forward, the required nose-up moment to counteract the inherent nose-down moment might exceed the maximum moment the elevator can provide.",
          "Step 5: Determine the forward CG limit. Consequently, the forward-most allowable CG location is dictated by the elevator's ability to generate sufficient nose-up pitching moment to trim the aircraft under critical conditions. A more effective elevator allows for a more forward CG limit.",
          "Step 6: Distinguish from the aft CG limit. The aft-most CG location is primarily determined by static longitudinal stability requirements, specifically that the CG must remain ahead of the neutral point ($X_{CG} < X_{NP}$) to ensure a positive static margin (Chunk 6). This is independent of elevator control effectiveness."
