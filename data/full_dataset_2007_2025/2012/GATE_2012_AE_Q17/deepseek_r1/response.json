        "reasoning": "Elevator control effectiveness ($C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$) is a measure of how effectively the elevator can generate a pitching moment. The forward-most (most forward) center of gravity (CG) limit is primarily determined by the maximum available elevator deflection ($\\delta_{e_{max}}$) required to trim the aircraft at demanding flight conditions (e.g., landing with flaps down, at low speed/high $C_L$). A higher elevator control effectiveness means a given deflection produces a larger pitching moment, allowing the aircraft to be trimmed with a more forward CG (which creates a larger, nose-down stabilizing moment) before hitting the mechanical limit of the elevator. Therefore, elevator control effectiveness directly determines the forward-most CG limit. The RAG context (Chunk 2 & 4) establishes the relationship between CG position, static margin, and elevator deflection for trim, which is the foundation for this conclusion."

          "Step 1: Define 'elevator control effectiveness'. It is the derivative $C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\delta_e}$, representing the change in pitching moment coefficient per unit elevator deflection.",
          "Step 2: Understand the trim condition. For longitudinal equilibrium (trim), the sum of pitching moments about the CG must be zero: $C_m = 0$. This is achieved by adjusting the elevator deflection ($\\delta_e$).",
          "Step 3: Recognize the forward CG limit constraint. When the CG is at its most forward allowable position, the aircraft is most stable (largest static margin). This creates a large, nose-down pitching moment that must be balanced by an upward lift force from the tail, requiring a significant up-elevator deflection ($\\delta_e$ is typically negative by convention).",
          "Step 4: Link effectiveness to the limit. The required elevator deflection for trim at a given CG location and flight condition is inversely proportional to $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$. A higher $|C_{m_{\\delta_e}}|$ means less deflection is needed to generate the required balancing moment.",
          "Step 5: Apply to the forward limit. The forward-most CG is the point where the required $\\delta_e$ for trim in the most critical condition (e.g., approach) just equals the maximum available upward deflection ($\\delta_{e_{max, up}}$). Since $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$ sets the relationship between CG position and required deflection, it directly determines how far forward the CG can go before the control surface runs out of authority."
