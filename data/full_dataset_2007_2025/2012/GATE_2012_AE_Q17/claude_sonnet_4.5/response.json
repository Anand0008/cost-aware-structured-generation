        "reasoning": "The elevator control effectiveness determines the forward-most location of the center of gravity (CG) for an aircraft. This is because the elevator control effectiveness is a measure of how effectively the elevator can change the lift produced by the horizontal tail. A higher elevator control effectiveness means a smaller elevator deflection is needed to achieve a given change in lift, which in turn affects the forward-most CG location that can be safely used. As the CG moves aft, the aircraft becomes less statically stable, and the elevator control effectiveness increases. Therefore, the elevator control effectiveness is a key factor in determining the forward-most CG limit, which is option C."
