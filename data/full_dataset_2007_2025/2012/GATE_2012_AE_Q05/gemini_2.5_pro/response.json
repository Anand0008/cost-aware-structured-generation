When such an airfoil is at zero angle of attack (i.e., its chord line is aligned parallel to the incoming free stream velocity), the flow over the upper and lower surfaces is perfectly symmetrical. This symmetry results in identical pressure distributions above and below the airfoil, leading to no net vertical force. Therefore, the lift generated is zero, and consequently, the lift coefficient ($\\text{C}_L$) is also zero. This is a fundamental principle of aerodynamics, as explicitly stated in multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (Chunks 1, 3, 5, 6)."

The flow is perfectly symmetrical.",

There is no differential pressure between the top and bottom surfaces that would create a net vertical force.",
