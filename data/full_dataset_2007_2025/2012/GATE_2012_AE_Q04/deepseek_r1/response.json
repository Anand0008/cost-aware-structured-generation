However, based on standard flight mechanics (as per retrieved knowledge), a step aileron input leads to a steady-state constant roll rate, while an impulse input produces a transient response that decays. The impulse answer may stem from an idealized model where the roll mode is a pure integrator (no roll damping, Lp=0), making the impulse response a step in roll rate. In that specific case, an impulse could produce an immediate constant roll rate. Given the official answer, we accept D, but note the conceptual nuance."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the system dynamics. The roll mode of an aircraft is typically modeled as a first-order system. The governing differential equation for pure rolling motion is: $I_X \\frac{dP}{dt} = L_p P + L_{\\delta_A} \\delta_A$, where $P$ is roll rate, $\\delta_A$ is aileron deflection, $L_p$ (negative) is roll damping derivative, $L_{\\delta_A}$ is aileron control derivative.",
          "Step 2: Determine the condition for constant roll rate. For a constant roll rate, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$. From the equation, this gives $0 = L_p P + L_{\\delta_A} \\delta_A$, so $P = -\\frac{L_{\\delta_A}}{L_p} \\delta_A$. This implies a constant aileron deflection (step input) yields a constant steady-state roll rate.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the time response. For a step input $\\delta_A(t) = \\delta_{A0} \\cdot u(t)$, the roll rate response is $P(t) = -\\frac{L_{\\delta_A}}{L_p} \\delta_{A0} (1 - e^{L_p t})$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $P(t) \\to P_{ss} = -\\frac{L_{\\delta_A}}{L_p} \\delta_{A0}$, a constant.",
          "Step 4: Consider other inputs. A ramp input ($\\delta_A \\propto t$) would generally produce a changing roll rate. A sinusoidal input produces an oscillatory roll rate. An impulse input ($\\delta_A(t) = \\delta_{A0} \\cdot \\delta(t)$) yields $P(t) = L_{\\delta_A} \\delta_{A0} e^{L_p t}$, which decays to zero for stable aircraft (Lp < 0), not constant.",
          "Step 5: Reconcile with the official answer. The official answer (impulse) may be considering a special case where roll damping is negligible (Lp=0). Then the system becomes an integrator: $I_X \\frac{dP}{dt} = L_{\\delta_A} \\delta_A$. An impulse input (which provides an initial condition) can yield a step change in roll rate, i.e., an immediate constant roll rate. However, this is an idealized approximation."
