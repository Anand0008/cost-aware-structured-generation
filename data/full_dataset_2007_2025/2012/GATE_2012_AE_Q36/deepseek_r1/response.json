          "Step 1: Understand the trim condition. At SSL (\\rho_0=1.22 kg/m^3), the aircraft is trimmed at V_0=100 m/s, meaning zero stick force is required for level flight.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the given off-trim condition at SSL. To hold V_1=90 m/s without re-trimming, a pull force F_1=5 N is needed. This establishes a relationship between stick force and the deviation from trim speed.",
          "Step 3: Determine the physical relationship. For a stable aircraft, the stick force (F) required to maintain a speed V away from the trim speed V_0 is proportional to the change in lift coefficient and dynamic pressure. Theory suggests F \\propto q (C_L - C_{L0}), where q = 0.5 \\rho V^2, and for level flight C_L = 2W/(\\rho V^2 S). This simplifies to F \\propto (1 - (\\rho V^2)/(\\rho_0 V_0^2)).",
          "Step 4: Establish proportionality constant. Using the SSL data point: (\\rho V^2)/(\\rho_0 V_0^2) = (1.22 * 90^2)/(1.22 * 100^2)=0.81, so 1 - 0.81 = 0.19. Thus, 5 N = k * 0.19, giving k = 5/0.19 \\approx 26.3158 N.",

          "Step 6: Calculate required force: F = k * (-0.07475) \\approx 26.3158 * (-0.07475) \\approx -1.967 N. The negative sign indicates a force opposite to pull, i.e., a push (downward force). Magnitude rounds to 1.95 N.",

Further, pull of 5 N holds the speed at 90 m/s without re-trimming at SSL (air density = 1.22 kg/m^3). To fly at 3000 m altitude (air density = 0.91 kg/m^3) and 120 m/s TAS without re-trimming, the aircraft needs"
