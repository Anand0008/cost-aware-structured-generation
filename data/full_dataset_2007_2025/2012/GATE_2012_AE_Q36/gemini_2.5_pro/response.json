        "reasoning": "The problem describes a scenario where an aircraft is trimmed at a specific speed and then flown at different speeds and altitudes 'without re-trimming'. This implies that the control surface (elevator) position is fixed to the initial trim setting. Any deviation from the trim speed will result in a pitching moment imbalance, which must be counteracted by a control force (stick force). The stick force is proportional to this pitching moment imbalance, which in turn is proportional to the change in dynamic pressure from the trim condition.\n\n1.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure at the initial trim condition (SSL, 100 m/s TAS):**\n    $\\rho_{SL} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $V_{trim} = 100 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_{trim} = 0.5 \\rho_{SL} V_{trim}^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (100)^2 = 6100 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure for the first scenario (SSL, 90 m/s TAS):**\n    $V_1 = 90 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_1 = 0.5 \\rho_{SL} V_1^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (90)^2 = 4941 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the constant of proportionality (C) for the stick force:**\n    A 'pull of 5 N' is required to hold the speed at 90 m/s. For a statically stable aircraft, reducing speed from trim requires a pull (nose-up moment) to counteract the natural nose-down tendency. This means the force is proportional to $(q_{trim} - q)$.\n    $F_s = C (q_{trim} - q)$\n    $5 \\text{ N} = C (6100 - 4941) = C (1159)$\n    $C = \\frac{5}{1159} \\approx 0.004314 \\text{ m}^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure for the second scenario (3000 m altitude, 120 m/s TAS):**\n    $\\rho_{alt} = 0.91 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $V_2 = 120 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_2 = 0.5 \\rho_{alt} V_2^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.91 \\times (120)^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.91 \\times 14400 = 6552 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the required control force for the second scenario:**\n    $F_s = C (q_{trim} - q_2) = 0.004314 \\times (6100 - 6552)$\n    $F_s = 0.004314 \\times (-452) \\approx -1.950 \\text{ N}$\n\n6.  **Interpret the sign of the force:**\n    Since a positive force (5 N) was defined as a 'pull' (upward force), a negative force ($-1.95 \\text{ N}$) implies a 'push' (downward force).\n    Therefore, the aircraft needs a 1.95 N downward force.\n\nThis matches option B."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of 'without re-trimming'. This implies that the elevator position (and thus the aerodynamic configuration related to pitching moment) is fixed to the initial trim condition. Any deviation from the trim speed will result in a non-zero pitching moment, requiring a control force to maintain the new speed.",
          "Step 2: Recognize that the stick force required to maintain a specific speed (different from trim speed) is proportional to the pitching moment imbalance. For a statically stable aircraft, this force is proportional to the difference between the trim dynamic pressure and the current dynamic pressure, i.e., $F_s = C(q_{trim} - q)$, where $C$ is a constant and a positive $F_s$ indicates a 'pull' (nose-up moment).",
          "Step 3: Calculate the dynamic pressure at the initial trim condition. Given true airspeed (TAS) of $100 \\text{ m/s}$ at standard sea level (SSL) with air density $\\rho_{SL} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. Use the dynamic pressure formula $q = 0.5 \\rho V^2$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the dynamic pressure for the first scenario where a control force is given. At SSL, TAS is $90 \\text{ m/s}$. Use the same dynamic pressure formula.",
          "Step 5: Use the given control force ($5 \\text{ N}$ pull) and the calculated dynamic pressures from Steps 3 and 4 to determine the constant of proportionality, $C$. A 'pull' corresponds to a positive force in our chosen convention.",

          "Step 7: Apply the determined constant $C$ and the dynamic pressures from Steps 3 and 6 to calculate the required control force for the second scenario.",
          "Step 8: Interpret the sign of the calculated force. If the force is positive, it's a 'pull' (upward force). If negative, it's a 'push' (downward force), based on the convention established in Step 5."

However, the RAG did not directly cover the concept of stick force gradient or the specific proportionality between control force and deviation from trim dynamic pressure, which was a critical component of the solution. This part relied on internal model knowledge of flight mechanics principles."
