        "reasoning": "1) At standard sea level (SSL), the aircraft is trimmed (zero stick force) at TAS V1 = 100 m/s. 2) When the pilot pulls with 5 N to hold 90 m/s without re-trimming, that 5 N is the stick force corresponding to a change in dynamic pressure from the trim condition: q1 - q2, where q = \\tfrac12 \\rho V^2. Thus stick force is proportional to (V^2 - V_{trim}^2) at fixed density. 3) The same aircraft, without re-trimming, flying at a different altitude but same configuration, will have stick force proportional to dynamic pressure difference from the original trim condition at SSL, i.e. proportional to (\\rho V^2 - \\rho_{SL} V_{trim}^2). 4) Using the known 5 N at SSL between 100 m/s and 90 m/s, we first find the proportionality constant k between stick force and dynamic-pressure difference: 5 = k [q(100) - q(90)] = k \\tfrac12 \\rho_{SL} (100^2 - 90^2). 5) At 3000 m, with \\rho = 0.91 kg/m^3 and V = 120 m/s, the stick force (taking upward as positive when speed is below trim and downward when above) is F = k [q(120, 0.91) - q(100, 1.22)]. 6) Substituting k from step 4 and simplifying gives F = 5 \\dfrac{0.91\\cdot 120^2 - 1.22\\cdot 100^2}{1.22(100^2 - 90^2)}. Numerically, 0.91\\cdot 120^2 = 13104, 1.22\\cdot 100^2 = 12200, difference = 904; denominator 1.22(100^2 - 90^2) = 1.22(10000 - 8100) = 1.22\\cdot 1900 = 2318. So F = 5 \\times 904/2318 \\approx 1.95 N. Since the dynamic pressure at the new condition is higher than at trim, the elevator must be pushed (nose-down) to reduce lift, which corresponds to a downward stick force. Therefore the correct option is 1.95 N downward force, i.e. option B."

          "Step 3: At 3000 m, \\rho_3 = 0.91 kg/m^3, V_3 = 120 m/s, with the same trim setting. The stick force is F_3 = k [q(120, 0.91) - q(100, 1.22)] = k [\\tfrac12 (0.91\\cdot 120^2 - 1.22\\cdot 100^2)].",

          "Step 5: Compute numerically: 0.91\\cdot 120^2 = 13104, 1.22\\cdot 100^2 = 12200, so numerator = 904. Denominator: 100^2 - 90^2 = 10000 - 8100 = 1900, so 1.22\\cdot 1900 = 2318. Hence F_3 = 5 \\times 904/2318 \\approx 1.95 N.",
          "Step 6: Interpret the sign: At 90 m/s (< 100 m/s), the pilot had to pull (upward force) to increase lift, so positive force corresponds to speed below trim. At 120 m/s and higher dynamic pressure than trim, the pilot must push (downward force) to reduce lift. Therefore the required force is 1.95 N downward, matching option B."
