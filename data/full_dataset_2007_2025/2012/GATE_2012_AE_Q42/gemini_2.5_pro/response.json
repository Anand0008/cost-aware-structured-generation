        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the fuel tank volume. This involves several sequential steps:\n1.  **Convert Units:** Ensure all given values are in consistent SI units. Chamber pressure $P_c = 40 \\text{ bar} = 40 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}$. Nozzle throat diameter $D_t = 50 \\text{ mm} = 0.05 \\text{ m}$. Burn time $t_b = 8 \\text{ minutes} = 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ s}$.\n2.  **Calculate Nozzle Throat Area ($A_t$):** $A_t = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D_t^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (0.05 \\text{ m})^2 = 0.0019635 \\text{ m}^2$.\n3.  **Calculate Total Propellant Mass Flow Rate ($\\dot{m}_{total}$):** Using the definition of characteristic velocity $c^* = \\frac{P_c A_t}{\\dot{m}_{total}}$, we can find $\\dot{m}_{total} = \\frac{P_c A_t}{c^*} = \\frac{(40 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}) \\times (0.0019635 \\text{ m}^2)}{1540 \\text{ m/s}} = 5.100 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n4.  **Determine Fuel Mass Flow Rate ($\\dot{m}_f$):** The fuel-oxidizer ratio is given as $f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_o} = 1.8$. Also, $\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_f + \\dot{m}_o$. Substituting $\\dot{m}_f = 1.8 \\dot{m}_o$ into the total mass flow rate equation: $\\dot{m}_{total} = 1.8 \\dot{m}_o + \\dot{m}_o = 2.8 \\dot{m}_o$. Therefore, $\\dot{m}_o = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{total}}{2.8} = \\frac{5.100 \\text{ kg/s}}{2.8} = 1.8214 \\text{ kg/s}$. Then, $\\dot{m}_f = 1.8 \\times \\dot{m}_o = 1.8 \\times 1.8214 \\text{ kg/s} = 3.2785 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n5.  **Calculate Total Fuel Mass ($M_f$):** $M_f = \\dot{m}_f \\times t_b = 3.2785 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 480 \\text{ s} = 1573.68 \\text{ kg}$.\n6.  **Calculate Minimum Fuel Tank Volume ($V_f$):** $V_f = \\frac{M_f}{\\rho_f} = \\frac{1573.68 \\text{ kg}}{900 \\text{ kg/m}^3} = 1.7485 \\text{ m}^3$. Rounding to two decimal places, the volume is $1.75 \\text{ m}^3$, which matches option B."

However, the core formula for characteristic velocity ($c^* = P_c A_t / \\dot{m}_{total}$) was not explicitly present in the provided RAG context, requiring reliance on internal knowledge for this specific formula."
