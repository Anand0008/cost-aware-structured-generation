However, for most common engineering materials, especially metals, it is positive. Retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2 and 6) states that 'Most common engineering materials have a positive Poisson's ratio, typically between 0.25 and 0.35'. Chunk 4 further specifies that 'For most metals, $\\mu$ (Poisson's ratio) typically varies between 0.25 and 0.5'. Considering these ranges, option C (0.2 $\\le \\nu \\le$ 0.4) is the most accurate representation for typical aircraft grade metallic alloys, as it encompasses the 'typically 0.25 to 0.35' range and is a reasonable practical range for metals."

These bounds are derived from the requirement that elastic moduli (Young's modulus E, Shear modulus G, Bulk modulus K) must be positive. The theoretical range is $-1 < \\nu < 0.5$.",

          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options against these typical ranges. Option A ($-1 \\le \\nu \\le 0$) includes negative values, which are characteristic of auxetic materials, not typical metallic alloys. Option B (0 $\\le \\nu \\le$ 0.2) is generally too low for most metals. Option D (0.4 $\\le \\nu \\le$ 0.5) is at the higher end, representing materials closer to incompressible (like rubber, where $\\nu \\approx 0.5$), but not typical for the majority of metals. Option C (0.2 $\\le \\nu \\le$ 0.4) best fits the 'typically 0.25 to 0.35' range and is a widely accepted practical range for most metallic alloys used in aerospace applications (e.g., aluminum alloys, steel, titanium alloys often fall in this range)."
