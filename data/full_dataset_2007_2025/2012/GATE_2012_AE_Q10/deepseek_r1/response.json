        "reasoning": "The theoretical range for Poisson's ratio (ν) for stable, isotropic, linear elastic materials is -1 < ν < 0.5. For most common engineering metals, ν is positive. Aircraft structures primarily use aluminum and titanium alloys. As per standard engineering knowledge (corroborated by RAG chunks 2 & 6), these metallic alloys typically have ν values between 0.25 and 0.35. The provided answer key (C) correctly identifies this common range (0.2 ≤ ν ≤ 0.4). Options A and B are too low/negative (characteristic of auxetic or highly specialized materials, not common metals). Option D (0.4 ≤ ν ≤ 0.5) is too high, approaching the incompressible limit (ν = 0.5), which is typical for rubbers, polymers, and fluids, not structural metals."

          "Step 1: Understand the question. It asks for the typical range of Poisson's ratio (ν) for 'aircraft grade metallic alloys'. This implies we need knowledge of standard material properties for structural aerospace metals like aluminum and titanium alloys.",

          "Step 3: Identify the typical values for common engineering metals. Most metals used in structural applications (steel, aluminum, titanium) have a positive Poisson's ratio, usually between 0.25 and 0.35. Auxetic materials (ν < 0) are rare and engineered, not standard aircraft metals. A value of 0.5 indicates incompressibility, typical of rubbers and fluids.",
          "Step 4: Apply this knowledge to 'aircraft grade' metals. The primary structural materials in aircraft are aluminum alloys and titanium alloys (see RAG chunks 1 & 3). These are standard metallic alloys, so their ν falls within the typical metal range.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options against this knowledge. Option A (-1 ≤ ν ≤ 0) is for auxetic materials. Option B (0 ≤ ν ≤ 0.2) is too low; common metals start around 0.25. Option D (0.4 ≤ ν ≤ 0.5) is too high, approaching incompressibility. Option C (0.2 ≤ ν ≤ 0.4) correctly encompasses the typical range of 0.25-0.35 for aircraft metals."
