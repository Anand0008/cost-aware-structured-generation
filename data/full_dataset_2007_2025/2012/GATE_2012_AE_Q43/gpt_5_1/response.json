For an impulsive (instantaneous) burn in vacuum/constant g, the rocket gets an initial upward velocity given by the ideal rocket equation without gravity loss: v_0 = c \\ln(m_0/m_f). With c = 3000 m/s, v_0 = 3000 \\ln(2.5) ≈ 3000 × 0.9163 ≈ 2749 m/s. After the impulse, the payload coasts upward under gravity alone. Using energy (or constant deceleration) for vertical motion: h = v_0^2 / (2 g). Thus h = 2749^2 / (2 × 9.81) ≈ 7.56×10^6 / 19.62 ≈ 3.86×10^5 m ≈ 386 km. Among the options, 385 km (option D) is the closest and matches the official key. This is consistent with standard rocket performance analysis for an impulsive burn, and differs from the finite-burn vertical case in the RAG example where gravity losses during burn reduce burnout velocity and altitude."
