        "notes": "RAG chunks (1 and 2) provide worked examples for vertical launch with finite burn time, including formulas for burnout velocity and altitude with gravity loss. These are not directly applicable because the question specifies 'instantaneous' expenditure (t_b=0). However, the rocket equation part is used. The coasting altitude formula was not in RAG; internal knowledge was used. Chunks 3-6 were about different aspects (solid motor design, multi-stage) and less relevant."

If all of it is expended instantaneously at an equivalent exhaust velocity of 3000 m/s, what would be the altitude attained by the payload when launched vertically? [Neglect drag and assume acceleration due to gravity to be constant at 9.81 m/s^2.]"
