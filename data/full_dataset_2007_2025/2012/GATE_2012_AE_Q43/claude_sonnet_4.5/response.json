Substituting the given values:\nu_b = 3000 * ln(1 / 0.4) - 9.81 * t_b\nu_b = 3000 * 0.9163 - 58.86 = 2748.9 m/s\n\nThe burnout altitude can then be calculated as:\nh_b = c * t_b * [1 - (ln(m_0 / m_f)) / ((m_0 / m_f) - 1)] - 0.5 * g_0 * t_b^2\nSolving this equation gives h_b ≈ 385 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 385 km."
