The maximum altitude is reached when its vertical velocity becomes zero. Using the kinematic equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$:\nHere, final velocity $v = 0$, initial velocity $u = \\Delta V$, acceleration $a = -g_0$ (acting downwards).\n$0^2 = (\\Delta V)^2 + 2(-g_0)h$\n$h = \\frac{(\\Delta V)^2}{2g_0}$\nGiven $g_0 = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n$h = \\frac{(2748.8721 \\text{ m/s})^2}{2 \\cdot 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}$\n$h = \\frac{7556298.5 \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2}{19.62 \\text{ m/s}^2}$\n$h = 385132.44 \\text{ m}$\nConverting to kilometers: $h = 385.132 \\text{ km}$.\nThis value is closest to option D (385 km)."
