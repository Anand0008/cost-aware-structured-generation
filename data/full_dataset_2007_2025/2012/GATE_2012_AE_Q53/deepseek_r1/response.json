        "notes": "RAG context provided general compressor performance examples (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6) but focused on centrifugal compressors and overall performance, not specifically axial compressor stage velocity triangles. Chunks 2 and 5 discussed component matching, which is less relevant. Thus, internal knowledge was primarily used for velocity triangle analysis. RAG relevance is moderate as it confirms power calculation methods."
