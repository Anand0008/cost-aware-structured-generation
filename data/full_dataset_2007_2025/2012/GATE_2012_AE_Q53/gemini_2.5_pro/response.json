        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the power consumed by an axial compressor stage. This is determined by the mass flow rate and the specific work done on the fluid, which can be found using the Euler turbomachinery equation. This equation relates the specific work to the blade speed and the change in tangential components of the absolute velocity across the rotor.\n\n1.  **Calculate axial and tangential components of absolute inlet velocity ($C_{a1}$, $C_{t1}$):**\n    Given absolute inlet velocity $C_1 = 120$ m/s and its angle to axial direction $\\alpha_1 = 18^\\circ$.\n    $C_{a1} = C_1 \\cos \\alpha_1 = 120 \\cos(18^\\circ) \\approx 120 \\times 0.951056 = 114.1267$ m/s\n    $C_{t1} = C_1 \\sin \\alpha_1 = 120 \\sin(18^\\circ) \\approx 120 \\times 0.309017 = 37.0820$ m/s\n\n2.  **Calculate the relative inlet blade angle ($\\beta_1$):**\n    Given mean blade speed $U = 200$ m/s.\n    From the inlet velocity triangle, $\\tan \\beta_1 = \\frac{U - C_{t1}}{C_{a1}}$\n    $\\tan \\beta_1 = \\frac{200 - 37.0820}{114.1267} = \\frac{162.918}{114.1267} \\approx 1.4275$\n    $\\beta_1 = \\arctan(1.4275) \\approx 55.00^\\circ$\n    (Note: This value would be the answer to the linked Q52. The options for Q52 do not include this value, which might be why Q53 received 'Marks to All'. However, for Q53, we proceed with this calculated value.)\n\n3.  **Calculate the relative outlet blade angle ($\\beta_2$):**\n    Given rotor turning angle $\\Delta\\beta = 27^\\circ$. The turning angle is defined as $\\Delta\\beta = \\beta_1 - \\beta_2$.\n    $\\beta_2 = \\beta_1 - \\Delta\\beta = 55.00^\\circ - 27^\\circ = 28.00^\\circ$\n\n4.  **Calculate the tangential component of absolute outlet velocity ($C_{t2}$):**\n    The axial velocity is assumed constant through the stage, so $C_{a2} = C_{a1} = 114.1267$ m/s.\n    From the outlet velocity triangle, $\\tan \\beta_2 = \\frac{U - C_{t2}}{C_{a2}}$\n    $C_{t2} = U - C_{a2} \\tan \\beta_2 = 200 - 114.1267 \\tan(28^\\circ)$\n    $C_{t2} \\approx 200 - 114.1267 \\times 0.531709 = 200 - 60.676 = 139.324$ m/s\n\n5.  **Calculate the specific work done on the air ($W_c$):**\n    Using Euler's turbomachinery equation for a compressor:\n    $W_c = U (C_{t2} - C_{t1})$\n    $W_c = 200 \\text{ m/s} \\times (139.324 - 37.082) \\text{ m/s}$\n    $W_c = 200 \\times 102.242 = 20448.4$ J/kg = 20.4484 kJ/kg\n\n6.  **Calculate the power required to drive the compressor ($P_{shaft}$):**\n    Given mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = 1$ kg/s.\n    $P_{shaft} = \\dot{m} \\times W_c$\n    $P_{shaft} = 1 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 20.4484 \\text{ kJ/kg} = 20.4484$ kW\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the power required is approximately 20.5 kW, which matches option D. The 'Marks to All' for this question likely stems from the discrepancy in the options for the linked Q52, which could lead students to incorrect intermediate values for Q53."
