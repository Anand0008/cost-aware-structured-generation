The region is bounded by the line $y=1$ and the semi-circle $y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. The semi-circle equation can be rewritten as $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ for $y \\le 1$, indicating a lower semi-circle centered at $(0,1)$ with radius $1$. \n\nTo find the volume of revolution about the x-axis, the Washer Method is appropriate. The outer radius $R(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the upper boundary, so $R(x) = 1$. The inner radius $r(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the lower boundary, so $r(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. The region spans from $x=-1$ to $x=1$.\n\nThe volume $V$ is given by the integral:\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (R(x))^2 - (r(x))^2 ] dx$$\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (1)^2 - (1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 ] dx$$\nExpand the inner term: $(1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + (1 - x^2) = 2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.\nSubstitute back into the integral:\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ 1 - (2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}) ] dx$$\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ -1 + x^2 + 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} ] dx$$\nSplit the integral into two parts:\n1.  $\\int_{-1}^{1} (x^2 - 1) dx = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3} - x\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - 1\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} + 1\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{3}$.\n2.  $\\int_{-1}^{1} 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$.

          "Step 2: Rewrite the equation of the semi-circle to understand its geometry. $y - 1 = -\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\implies (y-1)^2 = 1 - x^2 \\implies x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. Since $y-1 \\le 0$, this is the lower half of a circle centered at $(0,1)$ with radius $1$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the appropriate method for calculating the volume of revolution. Since the region is bounded by two curves and does not touch the axis of rotation, the Washer Method is used.",
          "Step 4: Define the outer radius $R(x)$ and inner radius $r(x)$. For rotation about the x-axis, $R(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the upper curve ($y=1$), so $R(x) = 1$. The inner radius $r(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the lower curve ($y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$), so $r(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.",
          "Step 5: Determine the limits of integration for $x$. The semi-circle $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ exists for $x$ values from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, the limits are $a=-1$ and $b=1$.",
          "Step 6: Set up the definite integral using the Washer Method formula: $V = \\pi \\int_a^b [ (R(x))^2 - (r(x))^2 ] dx$. Substitute the radii and limits: $V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (1)^2 - (1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 ] dx$.",
          "Step 7: Simplify the integrand algebraically. Expand $(1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + (1 - x^2) = 2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. Then, $1 - (2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = -1 + x^2 + 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.",
          "Step 8: Evaluate the integral. Split the integral into two parts: $\\int_{-1}^{1} (x^2 - 1) dx$ and $\\int_{-1}^{1} 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$. The first part evaluates to $-4/3$. The second part represents twice the area of a semi-circle of radius 1, which is $2 \\times (\\pi/2) = \\pi$. Combine these to get $V = \\pi [ -4/3 + \\pi ] = \\pi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$."
