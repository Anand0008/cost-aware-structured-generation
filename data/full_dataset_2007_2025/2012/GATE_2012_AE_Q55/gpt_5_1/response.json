So\\n  $$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}[(-\\sigma + \\sigma)^2 + (-\\sigma - 0)^2 + (0 + \\sigma)^2]} = |\\sigma|.$$\\n- Thus the equivalent stress for a given pressure difference $p$ is identical in magnitude to the internal-pressure case.\\n- Therefore yielding (by von Mises) occurs when $|\\sigma| = \\sigma_Y$ at the same pressure difference $p = p_Y$.\\n\\n3) The problem explicitly says to assume elastic stability until yield, so we ignore buckling under external pressure and consider only material yielding. Under that assumption, the yield pressure in external pressure is the same as in internal pressure. Hence option C: \"occurs at about the same pressure $p_Y$\" is correct."
