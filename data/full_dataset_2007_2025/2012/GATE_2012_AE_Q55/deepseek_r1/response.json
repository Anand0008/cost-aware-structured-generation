Under von Mises criterion with σ1 = σ2 = σ and σ3 ≈ 0, the equivalent stress σ_v = |σ|. Yielding occurs when σ_v = σ_Y. Thus, for internal pressure p_Y, σ = p_Y R/(2t) = σ_Y, so p_Y = 2t σ_Y / R. For external pressure, σ is compressive but same magnitude, so the external pressure causing yield is p_ext = 2t σ_Y / R = p_Y. Therefore, yielding occurs at about the same pressure magnitude."

          "Step 1: Recall stress in thin-walled spherical vessel. For a spherical vessel with inner radius R and wall thickness t, under uniform pressure p, the hoop stress (membrane stress) is σ = pR/(2t). This is valid for both internal pressure (p positive, tensile stress) and external pressure (p negative, compressive stress).",
          "Step 2: Identify the stress state. For a thin-walled sphere, the radial stress is negligible compared to hoop stress, so we have a biaxial stress state with σ1 = σ2 = σ (hoop stresses in two perpendicular directions), and σ3 ≈ 0 (radial stress).",
          "Step 3: Apply von Mises yield criterion. The von Mises equivalent stress for principal stresses is σ_v = √(0.5[(σ1-σ2)^2 + (σ2-σ3)^2 + (σ3-σ1)^2]). Substituting σ1 = σ2 = σ, σ3=0, we get σ_v = √(0.5[0^2 + σ^2 + (-σ)^2]) = √(0.5 * 2σ^2) = √(σ^2) = |σ|.",
          "Step 4: Set yielding condition. Yielding occurs when σ_v = σ_Y, where σ_Y is the yield strength in tension/compression (given as 500 MPa). So |σ| = σ_Y.",
          "Step 5: Relate stress to pressure. From Step 1, σ = pR/(2t). For internal pressure at yield, p_Y, we have p_Y R/(2t) = σ_Y, so p_Y = 2t σ_Y / R.",
          "Step 6: For external pressure, p_ext is negative, but stress σ = p_ext R/(2t) is compressive. The magnitude |σ| = |p_ext| R/(2t). Setting |σ| = σ_Y gives |p_ext| = 2t σ_Y / R = p_Y. Hence, the external pressure magnitude for yielding is approximately equal to p_Y."
