        "reasoning": "For a thin-walled spherical vessel, the principal stresses on the outer surface are `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h$` (hoop stress) and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$` (radial stress, neglected for thin walls). The hoop stress `$\\sigma_h$` is `$\\frac{pD}{4t}$` for internal pressure `p` (tensile) and `$-\\frac{pD}{4t}$` for external pressure `p` (compressive). When these principal stresses are substituted into the Von Mises yield criterion, `$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 \\right]}$`, the term `$(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2$` becomes zero because `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$`. This simplifies the Von Mises stress to `$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ (\\sigma_h - 0)^2 + (0 - \\sigma_h)^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ \\sigma_h^2 + \\sigma_h^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_h^2} = |\\sigma_h|$`. Therefore, yielding occurs when `$\\left| \\sigma_h \\right| = \\sigma_Y$`, which means `$\\left| \\frac{pD}{4t} \\right| = \\sigma_Y$`. Since the material's yield strength `$\\sigma_Y$` is given as `500 MPa` in both tension and compression (meaning `$\\left| \\sigma_Y \\right|$` is constant), the magnitude of the pressure required to cause yielding, `$\\left| p \\right| = \\frac{4t \\sigma_Y}{D}$`, is the same whether the pressure is internal or external. Thus, `p_ext_yield = p_Y`."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall the stress state in a thin-walled spherical vessel. For a spherical vessel under pressure `p`, inner diameter `D`, and wall thickness `t`, the principal stresses on the surface are `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h = \\frac{pD}{4t}$` (hoop stress) and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$` (radial stress, neglected for thin walls).",
          "Step 2: Apply the Von Mises yield criterion. The Von Mises equivalent stress `$\\sigma_v$` is given by `$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 \\right]}$`.",
          "Step 3: Substitute the principal stresses for a spherical vessel into the Von Mises criterion. Since `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h$` and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$`, the expression simplifies to `$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ (\\sigma_h - \\sigma_h)^2 + (\\sigma_h - 0)^2 + (0 - \\sigma_h)^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{0.5 \\left[ 0 + \\sigma_h^2 + \\sigma_h^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_h^2} = |\\sigma_h|$`.",
          "Step 4: Determine the yield condition for internal pressure `p_Y` (from Q54 context). For internal pressure, `$\\sigma_h = \\frac{p_Y D}{4t}$` (tensile). Yielding occurs when `$\\sigma_v = \\sigma_Y$`, so `$\\left| \\frac{p_Y D}{4t} \\right| = \\sigma_Y$`. Since `p_Y` is positive, `$\\frac{p_Y D}{4t} = \\sigma_Y$`, which gives `p_Y = \\frac{4t \\sigma_Y}{D}$`.",
          "Step 5: Determine the yield condition for external pressure `p_{ext}` (for the current question). For external pressure, the vessel is evacuated, so internal pressure is 0. The external pressure `p_{ext}` causes compressive hoop stress: `$\\sigma_h = -\\frac{p_{ext} D}{4t}$`. The principal stresses are `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = -\\frac{p_{ext} D}{4t}$` and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$`.",
          "Step 6: Apply the simplified Von Mises criterion for external pressure. `$\\sigma_v = |\\sigma_h| = \\left| -\\frac{p_{ext} D}{4t} \\right| = \\frac{p_{ext} D}{4t}$` (since `p_{ext}` is a positive magnitude).",
          "Step 7: Set the Von Mises stress equal to the yield strength. Yielding occurs when `$\\frac{p_{ext} D}{4t} = \\sigma_Y$`. This gives `p_{ext\\_yield} = \\frac{4t \\sigma_Y}{D}$`.",
          "Step 8: Compare the yield pressures. The expression for `p_Y` (from internal pressure) and `p_{ext\\_yield}` (from external pressure) are identical. Therefore, yielding occurs at about the same pressure `p_Y`."

However, it did not provide the specific formulas for stresses in thin-walled spherical pressure vessels, which had to be recalled from internal knowledge. The video reference for Prof. Nachiketa Tiwari in Chunk 1 lacked a URL, but a relevant video from Prof. S.P. Harsha was available in Chunk 3."
