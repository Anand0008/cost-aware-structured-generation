To maximize one number (let's say $n_5$), the other four numbers ($n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4$) must be as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest possible *different natural numbers* are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nSo, let:\n$n_1 = 1$\n$n_2 = 2$\n$n_3 = 3$\n$n_4 = 4$\n\nNow, substitute these minimum values into the sum equation:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + n_5 = 60$$\n$$10 + n_5 = 60$$\n$$n_5 = 60 - 10$$\n$$n_5 = 50$$\nThus, the largest possible value among the numbers is 50, which corresponds to option C."
