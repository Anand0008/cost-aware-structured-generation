The largest possible value among the numbers can be found by maximizing the sum of the five numbers, subject to the constraint that their arithmetic mean is 12.\n\nLet the five numbers be x, y, z, w, and v. The arithmetic mean is given as 12, so we have:\n(x + y + z + w + v) / 5 = 12\nRearranging, we get:\nx + y + z + w + v = 60\n\nSince the numbers are natural numbers, the largest possible value among them is 50. This is because the sum of the five numbers is 60, and the largest possible value that can be assigned to one of the numbers is 50, with the remaining four numbers being 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value among the five different natural numbers is 50, and the correct answer is C."
