Bernoulli's equation is valid under steady state conditions along a streamline in inviscid flow, and between any two points in potential flow.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Bernoulli's equation is derived under the assumptions of steady, inviscid, and incompressible flow. It is strictly valid only along a streamline in such flows.\n2. In potential flow, which is a special case of inviscid flow where the flow is also irrotational, Bernoulli's equation can be applied between any two points, not just along a streamline.\n3. Options B and C are incorrect because Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied between any two points in inviscid flow in general, only in potential flow.\n4. Option D is incorrect because Bernoulli's equation can be applied between any two points in potential flow, not just along a streamline."
