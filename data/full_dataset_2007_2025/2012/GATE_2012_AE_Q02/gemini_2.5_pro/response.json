To find its general solution, we first form the characteristic equation by replacing $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$ with $m^2$, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ with $m$, and $y$ with $1$. This yields the quadratic equation: $m^2 + m - 2 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(m+2)(m-1) = 0$. The roots are $m_1 = -2$ and $m_2 = 1$. Since these are distinct real roots, the general solution is given by the form $y(t) = A e^{m_1 t} + B e^{m_2 t}$, where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary constants. Substituting the roots, we obtain $y(t) = A e^{-2t} + B e^{1t}$, which simplifies to $y(t) = A e^{-2t} + B e^{t}$. This solution precisely matches option C."
