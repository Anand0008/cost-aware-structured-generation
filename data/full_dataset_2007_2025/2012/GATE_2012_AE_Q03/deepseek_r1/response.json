        "reasoning": "In aircraft stability and control, a trimmed condition signifies equilibrium in pitch. This equilibrium specifically requires that the net pitching moment about the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) is zero. This definition is explicitly stated in retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1: 'An airplane is considered to be trimmed... when the net moment about its center of gravity is zero'). The aerodynamic centre (option A) is a point where the pitching moment coefficient is constant with angle of attack, not necessarily zero. 25% of mean aerodynamic chord (option C) is often the wing's aerodynamic centre, not a point for whole-aircraft trim. 50% of wing root chord (option D) is a geometric reference unrelated to moment equilibrium. Thus, only option B is correct."
