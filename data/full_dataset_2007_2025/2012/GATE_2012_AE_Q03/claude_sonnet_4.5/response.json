This is the correct answer, as the aircraft will be in trim when the total pitching moment about the CG is zero, regardless of the moments about other points like the aerodynamic center or 25% MAC. The explanation provided in the retrieved knowledge supports this, stating that 'An airplane is considered to be trimmed (in equilibrium in pitch) when the net moment about its center of gravity is zero (M_cg = 0)'. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
