        "reasoning": "Fuselage skin buckling is a phenomenon that occurs under compressive stresses. Internal pressure in an aircraft fuselage induces tensile (hoop and axial) stresses in the skin. These tensile stresses counteract any compressive stresses that might arise from bending moments or external aerodynamic loads. By pre-stressing the skin in tension, the effective compressive stress required to initiate buckling is increased, thus delaying buckling. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 & 2) explicitly states that \"Frames are primarily designed to resist the hoop stresses induced by internal pressurization\" and that stringers prevent skin buckling under compressive or shear loads. While stringers are the primary means to resist buckling under axial compression, internal pressure provides an additional, crucial mechanism by putting the skin in tension. Options B, C, and D would all promote buckling: placing stiffeners farther apart increases the unsupported panel width (`$b$`), reducing skin thickness (`$t$`) decreases buckling resistance, and decreasing internal pressure removes the beneficial pre-tensioning effect."

          "Step 1: Understand the phenomenon of buckling. Buckling is a structural instability that occurs when a thin structural element (like fuselage skin) is subjected to compressive loads, causing it to deform out of its original plane.",
          "Step 2: Recall the role of internal pressure in aircraft fuselages. Commercial aircraft fuselages are pressurized to maintain a comfortable cabin environment at high altitudes. This internal pressure creates tensile stresses in the fuselage skin: circumferential (hoop) stress and longitudinal (axial) stress.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of tensile stress on buckling. Buckling is a *compressive* failure mode. When the fuselage skin is already under tension due to internal pressure, it becomes more resistant to any additional compressive forces that might arise from flight loads (e.g., bending moments). The tensile pre-stress effectively increases the critical compressive load required to initiate buckling, thereby delaying it.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.",
          "Step 5: Option A, 'increasing internal pressure', enhances the beneficial tensile pre-stress, making the skin more resistant to buckling. This is correct.",
          "Step 6: Option B, 'placing stiffeners farther apart', increases the unsupported width (`$b$`) of the skin panels. According to plate buckling theory, critical buckling stress is proportional to `$(t/b)^2$`. Increasing `$b$` reduces buckling resistance, making the skin *more* prone to buckling. This is incorrect.",
          "Step 7: Option C, 'reducing skin thickness', decreases `$t$`. This also reduces the critical buckling stress (`$\\propto (t/b)^2$`), making the skin *more* prone to buckling. This is incorrect.",
          "Step 8: Option D, 'placing stiffeners farther and decreasing internal pressure', combines two actions that would both *increase* the likelihood of buckling. This is incorrect."
