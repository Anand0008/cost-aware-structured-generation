        "reasoning": "Buckling is a stability failure under compressive stress. Internal pressurization induces tensile hoop stress in the fuselage skin, which counteracts compressive loads (e.g., from bending or external pressure differential) that cause buckling. This tensile pre-stress stabilizes the skin, delaying the onset of buckling. Options B, C, and D all reduce the skin's buckling resistance: increasing stiffener spacing raises the unsupported panel width, reducing critical buckling stress; reducing skin thickness directly lowers buckling resistance; and decreasing internal pressure removes the beneficial tensile pre-stress."

For a simply supported rectangular plate, the critical buckling stress $\\sigma_{cr}$ is proportional to $(t/b)^2$, where $t$ is skin thickness and $b$ is the unsupported width between supports (stiffeners or frames).",

(A) Increasing internal pressure induces tensile hoop stress, which superimposes a beneficial tensile stress on the skin, counteracting compressive stresses and delaying buckling. (B) Placing stiffeners farther apart increases $b$, decreasing $\\sigma_{cr}$ and promoting buckling. (C) Reducing skin thickness decreases $t$, drastically reducing $\\sigma_{cr}$ (since it depends on $t^2$). (D) This combines two detrimental actions: increasing $b$ and reducing the stabilizing tensile pre-stress.",
