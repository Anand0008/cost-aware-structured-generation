Increasing the internal pressure of the fuselage will increase the hoop stress in the fuselage skin, which helps delay the onset of skin buckling. This is because the hoop stress induced by the internal pressure counteracts the compressive stresses in the skin, making it more resistant to buckling. The other options, B, C, and D, would either decrease the skin's buckling resistance (placing stiffeners farther apart or reducing skin thickness) or have a negative effect on the internal pressure (placing stiffeners farther and decreasing internal pressure)."
