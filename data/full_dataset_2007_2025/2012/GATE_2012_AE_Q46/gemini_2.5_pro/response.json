          "Step 1: Identify the system and type of motion. The system is a viscously damped spring-mass system undergoing harmonic vibration described by $x(t) = X \\cos(\\omega_d t)$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of viscous damping force. The viscous damping force is $F_d = c \\dot{x}$, where $c$ is the viscous damping constant and $\\dot{x}$ is the velocity of the mass.",
          "Step 3: Express the displacement and velocity. Given the displacement $x(t) = X \\cos(\\omega_d t)$, the velocity is obtained by differentiating with respect to time: $\\dot{x}(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = -X \\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t)$.",
          "Step 4: Define energy dissipated per cycle. The energy dissipated per cycle ($W_d$) is the work done by the damping force over one complete cycle of oscillation. Mathematically, $W_d = \\oint F_d dx$. Since $dx = \\dot{x} dt$, this can be written as $W_d = \\int_0^{T} F_d \\dot{x} dt$, where $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_d$ is the period of oscillation.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the expressions for $F_d$ and $\\dot{x}$ into the integral: $W_d = \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_d} (c \\dot{x}) \\dot{x} dt = \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_d} c (-X \\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t))^2 dt$.",
          "Step 6: Simplify and integrate the expression: $W_d = c X^2 \\omega_d^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_d} \\sin^2(\\omega_d t) dt$. To evaluate the integral, use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$. The integral becomes $\\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_d} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\omega_d t)}{2} dt = \\frac{1}{2} [t - \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega_d t)}{2\\omega_d}]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_d}$. Evaluating this from $0$ to $2\\pi/\\omega_d$ yields $\\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_d} - 0) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_d}$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute the result of the integral back into the equation for $W_d$: $W_d = c X^2 \\omega_d^2 (\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_d}) = \\pi c \\omega_d X^2$.",
