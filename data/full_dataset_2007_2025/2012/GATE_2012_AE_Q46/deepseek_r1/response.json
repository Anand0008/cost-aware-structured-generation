Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4 explicitly give the formula $W_d = \\pi c \\omega X^2$. Chunk 5 discusses structural damping (different) and chunk 6 covers damped free vibration (related but not directly). The RAG provided exact derivations and physical intuitions, making it excellent for answering and explaining the question."
