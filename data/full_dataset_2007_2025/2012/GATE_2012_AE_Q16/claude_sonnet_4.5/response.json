This is because to initiate a dive maneuver, the aircraft needs to generate a negative (nose-down) pitch rate, which can be achieved by deflecting the elevator downwards. Reducing the engine thrust alone (option A) or reducing the angle of attack alone (option B) would not be sufficient to initiate a dive. Increasing the engine thrust (option D) would actually generate a nose-up pitching moment, the opposite of what is required to start a dive."
