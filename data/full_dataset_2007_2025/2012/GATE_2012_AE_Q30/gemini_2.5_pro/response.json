        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the maximum amplitude of vibration of the first degree of freedom for an undamped two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) system. The general solution for the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}(t)$ of an undamped MDOF system is a superposition of its normal modes:\n$$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\sin(\\omega_i t) + B_i \\cos(\\omega_i t))$$\nGiven:\n1.  Mode shapes: $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix}$\n2.  Natural frequencies: $\\omega_1 = 0.45 \\text{ Hz}$, $\\omega_2 = 1.2471 \\text{ Hz}$\n3.  Initial displacement: $\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ mm}$\n4.  Initial velocity: $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Apply initial velocity condition:**\n    The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\omega_i \\cos(\\omega_i t) - B_i \\omega_i \\sin(\\omega_i t))$.\n    At $t=0$, $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\omega_i)$.\n    Since $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $\\mathbf{\\phi}_i$ are linearly independent, we must have $A_i \\omega_i = 0$. Since $\\omega_i \\neq 0$, it implies $A_i = 0$ for all modes.\n    Therefore, the general solution simplifies to:\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\mathbf{\\phi}_1 B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\mathbf{\\phi}_2 B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n2.  **Apply initial displacement condition:**\n    At $t=0$, $\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\mathbf{\\phi}_1 B_1 + \\mathbf{\\phi}_2 B_2$.\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} B_1 + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix} B_2$$\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $2 = 1 \\cdot B_1 + 1 \\cdot B_2 \\implies B_1 + B_2 = 2$\n    (2) $1 = 0.5 \\cdot B_1 - 0.675 \\cdot B_2$\n\n3.  **Solve for $B_1$ and $B_2$:**\n    From equation (1), $B_2 = 2 - B_1$.\n    Substitute $B_2$ into equation (2):\n    $1 = 0.5 B_1 - 0.675 (2 - B_1)$\n    $1 = 0.5 B_1 - 1.35 + 0.675 B_1$\n    $1 + 1.35 = (0.5 + 0.675) B_1$\n    $2.35 = 1.175 B_1$\n    $B_1 = \\frac{2.35}{1.175} = 2$\n    Now find $B_2$: $B_2 = 2 - B_1 = 2 - 2 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Write the complete response $\\mathbf{u}(t)$:**\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} (2) \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix} (0) \\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cos(\\omega_1 t)$$\n\n5.  **Determine the maximum amplitude of the first degree of freedom:**\n    The displacement of the first degree of freedom is $u_1(t) = 2 \\cos(\\omega_1 t)$.\n    The maximum amplitude of $u_1(t)$ occurs when $\\cos(\\omega_1 t) = \\pm 1$.\n    Therefore, the maximum amplitude of the first degree of freedom is $2 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nThe calculation is consistent with the provided correct answer."

          "description": "If the mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is provided, the constants $A_i$ and $B_i$ can be found using the orthogonality property of mode shapes: $B_i = (\\mathbf{\\phi}_i^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{u}(0)) / (\\mathbf{\\phi}_i^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i)$ and $A_i = (\\mathbf{\\phi}_i^T \\mathbf{M} \\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0)) / (\\omega_i \\mathbf{\\phi}_i^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i)$. This method is generally more robust for larger systems.",
