The problem statement also confirms it automatically satisfies compatibility (as it's a polynomial of degree 2, which satisfies the biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$).",
          "Step 2: Recall the formulas for deriving stress components from the Airy stress function. These are $\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$, $\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$, and $\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$.",

They provided the definition of the Airy stress function, the formulas for deriving stress components, the biharmonic equation for compatibility, and the context of applying boundary conditions. This information was directly used to solve the problem and construct the explanation. Chunks 4 and 5 were less directly applicable but still related to the broader topic of Airy functions and 2D elasticity."
