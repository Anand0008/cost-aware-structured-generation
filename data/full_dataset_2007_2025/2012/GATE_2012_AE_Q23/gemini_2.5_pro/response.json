        "reasoning": "Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is a standardized measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine. It is defined as the total impulse per unit of propellant weight consumed. The standard formula for specific impulse is $I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m}g_0}$, where $F$ is the thrust, $\\dot{m}$ is the propellant mass flow rate, and $g_0$ is the standard acceleration due to gravity. The inclusion of $g_0$ in the denominator serves to convert the propellant mass flow rate (e.g., kg/s) into a weight flow rate (e.g., N/s), thereby giving specific impulse the unit of seconds (N / (N/s) = s). This $g_0$ is universally defined as the standard acceleration due to gravity at Earth's sea level, approximately $9.80665 \\text{ m/s}^2$. This value is a constant used for standardization, irrespective of the actual local gravitational acceleration at the rocket's operating location (e.g., Mars, or a crater on Mars). Therefore, for consistency and comparability across different environments, specific impulse is always normalized by Earth's standard sea level gravity."

For $I_{sp}$ to have units of seconds, and to serve as a universal metric, the 'g' in the denominator is not the local gravitational acceleration but a standard constant. This constant is universally agreed upon as the standard acceleration due to gravity at Earth's sea level, denoted as $g_0$ (approximately $9.80665 \\text{ m/s}^2$).",
