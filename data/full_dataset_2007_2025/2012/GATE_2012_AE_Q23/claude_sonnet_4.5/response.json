Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, the specific impulse should be normalized by the standard sea-level gravity on Earth (g_0 = 9.80665 m/s^2), as this is the common reference condition used for comparing rocket engine performance. The other options, such as the gravity at the bottom of the crater on Mars or the standard 'sea level' on Mars, would not be the appropriate reference for comparing the rocket's specific impulse to other engines designed for Earth's environment."
