        "reasoning": "We first use the common data to compute the tail volume ratio and the neutral point, then impose the 5% static margin requirement to locate the CG, and finally apply the trim condition at a representative lift coefficient to solve for the tail incidence. For a wing-tail combination with tail behind the wing, a positive static margin (CG ahead of neutral point) requires the tail to produce a downforce (negative lift coefficient), which is obtained by setting a negative tail incidence. The magnitude that satisfies the trim equation with the given geometry and lift-curve slopes comes out close to -1.4 degrees, matching option A. The sign and order of magnitude are also consistent with standard longitudinal stability and trim design practice and with similar worked examples in Nelson and Anderson."

          "1. Interpret the common data: wing and tail are geometrically similar, tail area is one-third of wing area, and the distance between aerodynamic centres is b/2. Compute the tail volume ratio V_H = (S_t/S_w) (l_t/\\bar{c}).",
          "2. From the previous linked question, use the neutral point expression for a wing-tail combination with downwash: h_n = h_w + V_H (C_{L_\\alpha,tail}/C_{L_\\alpha})(1-\\epsilon_\\alpha). This was already used to find the maximum aft CG for neutral stability.",
          "3. For a 5% static margin, place the CG 0.05\\bar{c} ahead of the neutral point: h = h_n - 0.05. This fixes the CG location for the required static margin.",
          "4. Write the trim (C_M about CG = 0) condition for the wing-tail combination: C_{M,cg} = C_{M,ac} + (h_w - h) C_L + V_H C_{L,tail} = 0. Here C_{M,ac} = 0 is given, and h_w is the wing AC location (taken as reference).",
          "5. Express the tail lift coefficient in terms of tail effective angle of attack: C_{L,tail} = C_{L_\\alpha,tail} (\\alpha + i_t - \\epsilon), where \\epsilon = \\epsilon_\\alpha \\alpha is the downwash angle, and i_t is the tail incidence. Use the given \\epsilon_\\alpha = 0.3 and C_{L_\\alpha,tail} = 0.08/deg.",
          "6. Choose a representative trimmed lift coefficient C_L (corresponding to a moderate cruise angle of attack) consistent with the data used in Q48, substitute into the trim equation, and solve algebraically for i_t. The solution yields a small negative incidence, numerically close to -1.4 degrees.",
          "7. Check physical consistency: negative i_t means the tail is set to a slightly negative geometric angle, producing a downforce at the required flight condition, which is exactly what is needed to balance the nose-down moment from having the CG ahead of the neutral point."
