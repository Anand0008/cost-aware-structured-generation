This is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that is separable, meaning terms involving `y` and `dy` can be grouped on one side, and terms involving `x` and `dx` on the other.",
          "Step 2: **Separate the variables.** Rewrite the equation by moving all `y` terms to the left side with `dy` and all `x` terms to the right side with `dx`: `$\\frac{dy}{2\\sqrt{y}} = dx$`",

          "Step 4: **Perform the integration.** For the left side, recall that `$\\frac{d}{dy}(\\sqrt{y}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}}$`. Therefore, `$\\int \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}} dy = \\sqrt{y}$`. For the right side, `$\\int 1 dx = x$`. Don't forget the constant of integration, `C'`, which is added to one side (conventionally the `x` side). This yields: `$\\sqrt{y} = x + C'$`",
