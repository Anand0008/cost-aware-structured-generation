        "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) is defined as the ratio of the useful propulsive power (thrust power) to the rate at which kinetic energy is imparted to the exhaust jet. For an ideal jet engine, the propulsive efficiency can be expressed as:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\text{Thrust Power}}{\\text{Kinetic Energy Added to Jet}} = \\frac{F V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e^2 - V_a^2)}$$\nWhere $F$ is the thrust, $V_a$ is the flight speed, $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity, and $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate of the working fluid. For an ideal jet, thrust $F = \\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)$. Substituting this into the efficiency equation:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e^2 - V_a^2)}$$\nUsing the difference of squares identity, $V_e^2 - V_a^2 = (V_e - V_a)(V_e + V_a)$:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)(V_e + V_a)} = \\frac{2V_a}{V_e + V_a}$$\nTo find the ratio of flight speed to exhaust velocity for maximum propulsive efficiency, let $R = V_a / V_e$. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $V_e$:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{2(V_a/V_e)}{(V_e/V_e) + (V_a/V_e)} = \\frac{2R}{1 + R}$$\nTo maximize this function, we can observe its behavior. As $R$ increases, $\\eta_p$ increases. The maximum theoretical value for $\\eta_p$ is 1 (or 100%). This occurs when the numerator equals the denominator in the simplified form, i.e., $2R = 1 + R$, which implies $R = 1$. Therefore, when the flight speed ($V_a$) equals the exhaust velocity ($V_e$), the propulsive efficiency is theoretically 100%. This is also explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Sutton-Biblarz, Ch. 2, §2.4), which confirms that the maximum value of $\\eta_p$ is 1 (or 100%) when $u/c = 1$ (where $u$ is flight speed and $c$ is exhaust velocity)."

          "Step 5: Determine the value of $R$ that maximizes $\\eta_p$. From the formula $\\eta_p = \\frac{2R}{1+R}$, it can be seen that $\\eta_p$ approaches its maximum theoretical value of 1 (or 100%) when $R = 1$. At $R=1$, $\\eta_p = \\frac{2(1)}{1+1} = 1$.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that the ratio of flight speed to exhaust velocity ($V_a/V_e$) for maximum propulsive efficiency is 1.0. This condition implies that the exhaust gases are left stationary relative to the ambient air, which results in zero thrust but maximum theoretical efficiency."
