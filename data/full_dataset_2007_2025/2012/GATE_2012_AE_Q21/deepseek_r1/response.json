        "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency (η_p) is defined as the ratio of thrust power to the rate of kinetic energy increase of the propellant. For both air-breathing and rocket engines, in ideal cases, η_p is expressed as a function of the velocity ratio R = V_a / V_e (flight speed to exhaust velocity). The standard formula is η_p = 2R / (1 + R^2) for jets or similar forms. To find the maximum, differentiate with respect to R and set to zero: dη_p/dR = 0 gives R = 1. Substituting R=1 yields η_p,max = 1 (100%). This is a fundamental result in propulsion theory, confirmed by retrieved knowledge from Sutton (Chunks 2 & 5) stating maximum η_p at u/c=1."
