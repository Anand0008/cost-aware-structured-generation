        "reasoning": "Rate of climb is given at two altitudes, so we assume a linear variation of R/C with altitude between them, as is standard in performance problems and consistent with the RAG example. At sea level (0 m), R/C = 300 m/s; at 2500 m, R/C = 150 m/s. Fit a straight line: R/C(h) = a + b h. Using the two points: 300 = a, and 150 = 300 + b(2500) \\Rightarrow b = -0.06 s^{-1}. Thus R/C(h) = 300 - 0.06 h. Time to climb from 500 m to 3000 m is t = \\int_{500}^{3000} \\frac{dh}{R/C(h)} = \\int_{500}^{3000} \\frac{dh}{300 - 0.06 h}. Integrating gives t = -\\frac{1}{0.06} \\ln|300 - 0.06 h| \\big|_{500}^{3000} = -16.6667 [\\ln(300 - 0.06\\cdot 3000) - \\ln(300 - 0.06\\cdot 500)]. Evaluate: 300 - 0.06\\cdot 3000 = 120; 300 - 0.06\\cdot 500 = 270. So t = -16.6667[\\ln(120) - \\ln(270)] = -16.6667 \\ln(120/270) = -16.6667 \\ln(4/9) \\approx -16.6667(-0.81093) \\approx 13.5 s, which lies in the official range 13 to 14 s."
