        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the time to climb given a varying rate of climb (R/C) with altitude. The fundamental relationship for time to climb is given by $t = \\int_{h_1}^{h_2} \\frac{dh}{R/C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rate of Climb (R/C) function.**\nAssume a linear relationship for R/C with altitude $h$: $R/C = A + Bh$.\nGiven:\n- At sea level ($h=0$ m), $R/C = 300$ m/s.\n- At $h=2500$ m, $R/C = 150$ m/s.\n\nUsing the first condition:\n$300 = A + B(0) \\implies A = 300$\n\nUsing the second condition:\n$150 = A + B(2500)$\n$150 = 300 + B(2500)$\n$B(2500) = 150 - 300 = -150$\n$B = \\frac{-150}{2500} = -0.06$\n\nSo, the R/C function is: $R/C = 300 - 0.06h$ (m/s).\n\n**Step 2: Set up the integral for time to climb.**\nThe aircraft climbs from $h_1 = 500$ m to $h_2 = 3000$ m.\n$t = \\int_{500}^{3000} \\frac{dh}{300 - 0.06h}$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral.**\nLet $u = 300 - 0.06h$.\nThen, $du = -0.06 dh \\implies dh = -\\frac{1}{0.06} du = -\\frac{100}{6} du = -\\frac{50}{3} du$.\n\nChange the limits of integration:\n- When $h = 500$ m, $u_1 = 300 - 0.06(500) = 300 - 30 = 270$.\n- When $h = 3000$ m, $u_2 = 300 - 0.06(3000) = 300 - 180 = 120$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$t = \\int_{270}^{120} \\frac{-50/3}{u} du$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\int_{270}^{120} \\frac{1}{u} du$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} [\\ln|u|]_{270}^{120}$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} (\\ln(120) - \\ln(270))$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{120}{270}\\right)$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{27}\\right)$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)$\n\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)$\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\ln(2.25)$\n\nCalculate the numerical value:\n$\\ln(2.25) \\approx 0.81093$\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\times 0.81093 \\approx 16.6667 \\times 0.81093 \\approx 13.5155$ seconds.\n\nThis value (13.5155 s) falls within the specified correct answer range of 13 to 14 seconds."
