That is, $C_{p,s} = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_1 V_1^2}$.\\nFor an ideal diffuser, assuming incompressible flow (a standard assumption when Mach number is not specified for such problems), Bernoulli's equation states that the total pressure is conserved: $p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$. From this, the static pressure rise can be expressed as $p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)$.\\nSubstituting this into the definition of $C_{p,s}$: $C_{p,s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^2$.\\nFor incompressible flow, the continuity equation is $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$. Therefore, the velocity ratio is $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$.\\nThe given area ratio is $A_2/A_1 = 2.0$. So, $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{1}{2.0} = 0.5$.\\nSubstituting this velocity ratio into the $C_{p,s}$ formula: $C_{p,s} = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\\nAlthough the official GATE answer key for this question is 'Marks to All', which suggests potential ambiguity or a flaw in the question, the derivation for option C (0.75) is straightforward and based on standard ideal incompressible flow assumptions for diffusers."

          "Step 2: Apply the 'ideal' assumption. In the absence of specific Mach number information, 'ideal' for a diffuser often implies isentropic and incompressible flow. For incompressible, ideal flow, Bernoulli's equation states that the total pressure (or stagnation pressure) is conserved: $p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$.",
          "Step 3: Rearrange Bernoulli's equation to express the static pressure rise ($p_2 - p_1$): $p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute this expression for ($p_2 - p_1$) into the definition of $C_{p,s}$: $C_{p,s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2}$.",
          "Step 5: Simplify the expression: $C_{p,s} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^2$.",
          "Step 6: Use the continuity equation for incompressible flow to relate velocities to areas. For steady, incompressible flow in a duct, $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$. This implies $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute the given area ratio. The problem states the area ratio is $A_2/A_1 = 2.0$. Therefore, $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{1}{2.0} = 0.5$. So, $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = 0.5$.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided good foundational context on diffusers, their function, and general ideal/isentropic flow principles (e.g., constant stagnation properties, kinetic to static pressure conversion, area-velocity relationship). However, the specific formula for the ideal static pressure coefficient in terms of area ratio for incompressible flow was not explicitly present in the RAG context. The solution required combining general fluid dynamics principles (Bernoulli, Continuity) with the definition of the coefficient, relying on internal knowledge for the direct derivation."
