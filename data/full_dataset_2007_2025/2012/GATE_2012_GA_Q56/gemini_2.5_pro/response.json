The construction 'would like to have + past participle' is the correct and most natural idiomatic expression for this meaning in English. Therefore, 'I would like to have bought a diamond ring' correctly conveys the speaker's wish that they had bought a diamond ring.

          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A, 'have a liking.' 'I have a liking to have bought...' is grammatically awkward and incorrect. 'Have a liking for' is a common idiom, but not in this construction with a perfect infinitive.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B, 'should have liked.' 'I should have liked to have bought...' is grammatically possible but implies a sense of regret or a missed obligation, and is less idiomatic for a general wish than 'would like.' The double 'have' also makes it sound clunky.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C, 'would like.' 'I would like to have bought a diamond ring.' This is a standard and correct idiomatic expression in English. 'Would like to have + past participle' is used to express a desire for a past action that did not occur.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D, 'may like.' 'I may like to have bought...' implies possibility or permission in the present, which does not align with the past perfect infinitive 'to have bought.' It is grammatically incorrect in this context.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that 'would like' is the most appropriate and grammatically correct choice that conveys the intended meaning."
