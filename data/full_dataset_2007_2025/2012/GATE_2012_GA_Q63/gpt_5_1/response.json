Since the question assumes a prime that leaves remainder 1 when divided by 4, it satisfies p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}, so it can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers. The options mention natural numbers; for primes of this form, we can choose non-zero natural numbers (e.g., 5 = 1^2 + 2^2, 13 = 2^2 + 3^2, 17 = 1^2 + 4^2).
