This leads to a mode shape of the form\n$\\phi(x) = B \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{\\omega x}{c}\\right)$ and the frequency equation $\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{\\omega L}{c}\\right)=0$.\nSo\n$\\dfrac{\\omega L}{c} = \\dfrac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}$, $n=1,2,3,\\dots$\nTherefore\n$\\omega_n^{Ff} = \\dfrac{(2n-1)\\pi c}{2L}$.\nThe fundamental (n=1) is\n$\\omega_1^{Ff} = \\dfrac{\\pi c}{2L}$.\n\n3) Ratio of new to original fundamental frequency:\n$k = \\dfrac{\\omega_1^{Ff}}{\\omega_1^{FF}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\pi c}{2L}}{\\dfrac{\\pi c}{L}} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, when the boundary condition changes from fixed-fixed to fixed-free, the fundamental natural frequency becomes half the original, so $k = 1/2$, which corresponds to option A."
