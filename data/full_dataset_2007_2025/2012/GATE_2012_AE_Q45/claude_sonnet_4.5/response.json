When the boundary condition is changed from fixed-fixed to fixed-free, the effective mass of the system increases, as the free end can now move more freely. According to the formula for the natural frequency of a longitudinally vibrating rod, $\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\sqrt{\\frac{EA}{\\rho A}}$, where $n$ is the mode number, $L$ is the length of the rod, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $\\rho$ is the density, the natural frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the effective mass. Since the effective mass increases when the boundary condition changes from fixed-fixed to fixed-free, the fundamental natural frequency (n=1) will decrease by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, or $k=1/2$."
