        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio 'k' of the fundamental natural frequency of a fixed-free rod to that of a fixed-fixed rod, both undergoing longitudinal vibration. The speed of the longitudinal wave in the rod is $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho_V}$, where $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\rho_V$ is the mass per unit volume.\n\n1.  **Fixed-Fixed Rod (Original Condition):**\n    For a rod of length $L$ fixed at both ends ($x=0$ and $x=L$), the boundary conditions for longitudinal vibration are zero displacement at both ends: $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(L,t) = 0$. The general solution for the mode shape is $\\phi(x) = A \\cos(\\frac{\\omega}{c} x) + B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega}{c} x)$.\n    Applying $\\phi(0) = 0 \\implies A = 0$. So, $\\phi(x) = B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega}{c} x)$.\n    Applying $\\phi(L) = 0 \\implies B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega}{c} L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega}{c} L) = 0$.\n    This implies $\\frac{\\omega}{c} L = n\\pi$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n    The natural frequencies are $\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi c}{L}$.\n    The fundamental natural frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{FF} = \\frac{\\pi c}{L}$.\n\n2.  **Fixed-Free Rod (New Condition):**\n    For a rod of length $L$ fixed at one end ($x=0$) and free at the other ($x=L$), the boundary conditions for longitudinal vibration are zero displacement at the fixed end and zero stress (hence zero strain, or zero slope of displacement) at the free end: $u(0,t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L,t) = 0$.\n    Applying $u(0,t) = 0$ (as above) gives $\\phi(x) = B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega}{c} x)$.\n    The derivative is $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = B \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega}{c} x)$.\n    Applying $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}(L) = 0 \\implies B \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega}{c} L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0, \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\neq 0$), we must have $\\cos(\\frac{\\omega}{c} L) = 0$.\n    This implies $\\frac{\\omega}{c} L = (2n-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ (or $(n+1/2)\\pi$ for $n=0,1,2,...$).\n    The natural frequencies are $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi c}{2L}$.\n    The fundamental natural frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{FC} = \\frac{\\pi c}{2L}$.\n\n3.  **Ratio 'k':**\n    The question states the new frequency is $k$ times the original frequency. So, $k = \\frac{\\omega_{FC}}{\\omega_{FF}}$.\n    $k = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi c}{2L}}{\\frac{\\pi c}{L}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $1/2$."

However, the fixed-fixed longitudinal vibration frequency equation was not directly provided; Chunk 4 discussed fixed-fixed *torsional* vibration, which has a similar mathematical form but different physical constants. I used internal knowledge to confirm the fixed-fixed longitudinal case."
