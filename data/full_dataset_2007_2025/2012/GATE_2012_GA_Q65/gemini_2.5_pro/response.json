The phrase 'taken for granted' directly implies that social scientists 'did not question that progress was a fact.' Let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A. did not question that progress was a fact.** This aligns perfectly with 'Progress was taken for granted.' If something is taken for granted, it is accepted without question.\n*   **B. did not approve of Biology.** The passage says theories were 'inspired less by Biology than by the conviction of social scientists'. This indicates a different primary source of inspiration, not disapproval of Biology itself.\n*   **C. framed the laws of progress.** The passage states they 'attempted to discover its laws and phases.' Attempting to discover is not the same as successfully framing or establishing them as definitive laws.\n*   **D. emphasized Biology over Social Sciences.** This directly contradicts the passage, which states they were 'inspired less by Biology than by the conviction of social scientists'.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most accurate inference that can be drawn directly from the given passage."
