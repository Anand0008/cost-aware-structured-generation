This definition is consistently provided across multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (e.g., Chunk 2, 3, 4, 5). Option A and B are incorrect because $M_{cr}$ is generally a subsonic freestream Mach number, not sonic or supersonic. Option D is incorrect because at $M_{cr}$, only a *local* point reaches Mach 1.0, not the entire airfoil surface; a region of supersonic flow forms only when the freestream Mach number *exceeds* $M_{cr}$."
