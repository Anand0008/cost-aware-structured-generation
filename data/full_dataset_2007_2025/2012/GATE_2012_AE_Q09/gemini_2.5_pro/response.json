        "reasoning": "The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for static transverse deflection under a distributed load `q(x)` is given by the equation `EI \\frac{d^4v}{dx^4} = q(x)`. Let's analyze its properties:\n1.  **Order:** The highest derivative is the fourth derivative (`\\frac{d^4v}{dx^4}`), making it a **4th order** differential equation.\n2.  **Type:** The deflection `v` is a function of only one independent variable, `x` (position along the beam), for static problems. Therefore, it is an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**, not a partial differential equation (PDE).\n3.  **Linearity:** The dependent variable `v` and its derivatives appear only to the first power, and there are no products of `v` or its derivatives. Thus, it is a **linear** differential equation.\n4.  **Homogeneity:** The right-hand side of the equation is `q(x)`, which represents the uniformly distributed load. Since the question specifies an 'uniformly distributed load', `q(x)` is a non-zero constant. An equation is homogenous if its right-hand side is zero. Since `q(x) \\neq 0`, the equation is **non-homogenous**.\n\nCombining these characteristics, the governing equation is a 4th order linear non-homogenous ordinary differential equation. This matches option B."
