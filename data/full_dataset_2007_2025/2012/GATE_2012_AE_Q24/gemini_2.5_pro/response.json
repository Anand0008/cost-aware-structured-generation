        "reasoning": "In a semi-monocoque aircraft wing, both the skin and spar webs play critical roles in resisting various loads:\n\n1.  **Skin:** The wing skin, particularly in conjunction with longitudinal stringers, primarily resists normal (bending) stresses and shear stresses. Crucially, the skin forms the outer surface of the closed section, known as the 'torque box,' which is highly efficient in resisting torsional (twisting) moments by developing shear stresses. It also carries shear stresses due to vertical shear forces.\n2.  **Spar Webs:** Spars are the main longitudinal load-bearing members of the wing. While the spar caps (flanges) are designed to primarily carry normal stresses resulting from bending moments, the spar webs are specifically designed to resist shear forces. They carry vertical shear stresses and, as part of the torque box formed with the skin, contribute significantly to resisting torsional moments by developing shear stresses.\n\nAerodynamic forces acting on the wing generate both vertical forces (lift), which lead to vertical shear forces and bending moments, and pitching/rolling moments, which lead to torsional moments. Therefore, the skin and spar webs collectively act as primary carriers of shear stresses arising from both direct aerodynamic forces (vertical shear) and aerodynamic moment components (torsion). Option D accurately encapsulates this combined load-carrying function. Options A and C are too restrictive by using 'alone,' and option B incorrectly emphasizes normal stresses for spar webs, whose primary role is shear resistance."

          "Step 2: Recall the primary functions of the wing skin. The skin serves as the aerodynamic surface and, in semi-monocoque construction, is a stressed member. It resists both normal (bending) stresses (in conjunction with stringers) and shear stresses (due to torsion and vertical shear forces). It forms the 'closed section' or 'torque box' with the spars.",
          "Step 3: Recall the primary functions of spar webs. Spars are the main longitudinal load-bearing members. While spar caps (flanges) primarily resist bending moments by carrying normal stresses, the spar webs are specifically designed to resist shear forces. They carry vertical shear stresses and contribute to resisting torsional moments as part of the torque box.",
          "Step 4: Consider the types of loads generated by aerodynamic forces. Aerodynamic forces on a wing generate lift (a distributed vertical force) and pitching/rolling moments (distributed moments, leading to torsion).",
          "Step 5: Relate the aerodynamic loads to the component functions. The vertical aerodynamic forces induce vertical shear forces and bending moments along the wing. The aerodynamic moments induce torsional moments. Both vertical shear forces and torsional moments primarily induce shear stresses in the skin and spar webs.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the given options based on the combined understanding. Option D, 'shear stresses due to aerodynamic forces and a moment component,' accurately describes the primary load-carrying role of both the skin and spar webs, encompassing shear due to vertical forces and shear due to torsional moments."

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent and direct information regarding the functions of skin and spar webs in semi-monocoque construction. Specifically, Chunk 1 and Chunk 5 explicitly mentioned the skin and spar webs forming a torque box to resist shear and torsional (moment) loads, which directly supports the correct answer. The video chunks reinforced the conceptual understanding of semi-monocoque structures and component roles. The information was highly relevant and sufficient to confidently answer the question."
