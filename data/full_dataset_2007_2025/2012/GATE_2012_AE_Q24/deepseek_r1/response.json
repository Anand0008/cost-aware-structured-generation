Aerodynamic forces (lift, drag) produce vertical and horizontal shear flows, generating shear stresses. Additionally, aerodynamic moments (e.g., twisting moments due to asymmetric lift or control surface deflection) produce torsion, which is resisted by shear stresses in the closed cell formed by the skin and spar webs. Therefore, skin and spar webs are primary carriers of shear stresses from both aerodynamic forces and moment components. Options A and C are incomplete (ignore forces or moment, respectively). Option B is incorrect because normal (bending) stresses are primarily carried by longitudinal members like stringers and spar caps, not the skin and webs in their primary role."
