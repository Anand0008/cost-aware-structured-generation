Using the formula relating the logarithmic decrement (δ) to the damping ratio (ζ) for a viscously damped SDOF system:\n\nδ = (2πζ) / √(1 - ζ^2)\n\nRearranging this, we get:\n\nζ = δ / (2π) / √(1 + (δ / 2π)^2)\n\nSubstituting δ = 0.125, we get:\n\nζ = 0.125 / (2π) / √(1 + (0.125 / 2π)^2)\nζ ≈ 0.0199 or 1.99%\n\nTherefore, the damping factor closest to 1.99% is 2.0%, which corresponds to option D."
