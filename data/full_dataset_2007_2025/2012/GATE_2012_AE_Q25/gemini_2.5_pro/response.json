        "reasoning": "The logarithmic decrement ($\\delta$) is related to the damping ratio ($\\zeta$) by the formula $\\delta = \\frac{2 \\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}}$. For most engineering systems, especially when the damping ratio is small ($\\zeta \\ll 1$), the term $\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$ can be approximated as 1. This simplifies the formula to $\\delta \\approx 2 \\pi \\zeta$. Given $\\delta = 0.125$, we can calculate $\\zeta = \\frac{\\delta}{2 \\pi}$. Substituting the value, $\\zeta = \\frac{0.125}{2 \\times 3.14159} \\approx \\frac{0.125}{6.28318} \\approx 0.01989$. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: $\\zeta \\% = 0.01989 \\times 100\\% \\approx 1.989\\%$. Comparing this to the given options, $2.0\\%$ is the closest value.
