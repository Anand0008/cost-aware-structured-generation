At the same speed \\( V \\), the aircraft establishes a new equilibrium with a lower climb angle \\( \\gamma_2 \\). Since \\( L = W \\cos(\\gamma) \\), a decrease in \\( \\gamma \\) increases \\( \\cos(\\gamma) \\), thus increasing lift and induced drag. Therefore, drag \\( D_2 > D_1 \\). Consequently, \\( T_2 - D_2 = 0.9 T_1 - D_2 < 0.9 T_1 - D_1 \\). Since \\( T_1 - D_1 = W \\sin(\\gamma_1) \\), we have \\( 0.9 T_1 - D_1 = 0.9 W \\sin(\\gamma_1) - 0.1 D_1 \\). With \\( D_2 > D_1 \\), \\( T_2 - D_2 < 0.9 W \\sin(\\gamma_1) - 0.1 D_1 \\). The drop in \\( T-D \\) is more than 10% of the initial \\( T-D \\), so \\( V_{c2} < 0.9 V_{c1} \\), meaning the rate of climb is lower by more than 10%. Linearization analysis confirms that \\( \\frac{dV_c}{dT} = \\frac{V}{W - 2B \\sin(\\gamma)} > \\frac{V}{W} \\) for positive \\( B \\), indicating a larger sensitivity to thrust changes when drag varies with climb angle."

          "Step 5: Since speed is constant, drag depends on lift coefficient. From \\( L = W \\cos(\\gamma) \\), if \\( \\gamma_2 < \\gamma_1 \\) (thrust decreased), then \\( \\cos(\\gamma_2) > \\cos(\\gamma_1) \\), so lift increases.
