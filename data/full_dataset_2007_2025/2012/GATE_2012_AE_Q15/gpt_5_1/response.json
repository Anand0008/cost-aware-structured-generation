        "reasoning": "For steady climb at speed V, rate of climb (ROC) is related to excess power: $ROC = \\dfrac{P_{excess}}{W} = \\dfrac{(T - D)V}{W}$. At the initial equilibrium climb: $ROC_1 = \\dfrac{(T_1 - D_1)V}{W}$. After a 10% thrust drop, thrust becomes $T_2 = 0.9T_1$. The aircraft is said to reach a new steady equilibrium at the same speed, so drag adjusts to a new value $D_2$ such that $T_2 > D_2$ but with a smaller excess. Importantly, the 10% drop is on total thrust, not on excess thrust. Since excess thrust $T - D$ in climb is typically only a fraction of total thrust, a 10% reduction in T corresponds to a much larger percentage reduction in $(T - D)$.\\n\\nIllustration with representative numbers: suppose initially $T_1 = 1.2D_1$ (20% excess thrust). Then $T_1 - D_1 = 0.2D_1$. A 10% drop gives $T_2 = 0.9T_1 = 1.08D_1$. If drag at same speed remains close to $D_1$ (small change in CL for small change in climb angle), the new excess thrust is about $T_2 - D_1 = 0.08D_1$. The excess thrust has dropped from $0.2D_1$ to $0.08D_1$, i.e., a 60% reduction, far more than 10%. Since $ROC \\propto (T - D)$ at fixed V and W, the rate of climb decreases by more than 10%.\\n\\nMore formally, for small climb angles, $D$ is almost unchanged when thrust changes slightly, so the absolute reduction in excess thrust is approximately $0.1T_1$, while the initial excess is $(T_1 - D)$. Because $(T_1 - D) \\ll T_1$ in typical climbs, the fractional change in ROC, $\\dfrac{\\Delta ROC}{ROC_1} \\approx \\dfrac{-0.1T_1}{T_1 - D}$, has magnitude greater than 0.1. Therefore the new ROC is lower by more than 10%, matching option B."

The specific qualitative sensitivity to thrust loss was not explicitly in RAG but follows straightforwardly from the provided formulas."
