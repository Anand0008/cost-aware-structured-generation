        "reasoning": "The question states that the aircraft experiences a 10% drop in thrust during a steady climb. This means the excess thrust available for climb (T - D) has decreased by 10%. From the rate of climb formula, $V_c = (P_{available} - P_{required}) / W = (T - D) / W$, a 10% decrease in (T - D) will result in a more than 10% decrease in the rate of climb. This is because the rate of climb is directly proportional to the excess thrust available. Therefore, the new rate of climb will be lower by more than 10%, confirming that the correct answer is B."
