        "reasoning": "The rate of climb (R/C) for an aircraft in steady, unaccelerated flight is directly proportional to the excess thrust (Thrust Available, $T_A$ minus Thrust Required, $T_R$ or Drag, $D$) and the flight velocity ($V$), and inversely proportional to its weight ($W$). The fundamental formula is given by $R/C = \\frac{V(T_A - D)}{W}$.\n\nLet's denote the initial conditions with subscript 1 and the new conditions with subscript 2.\nInitial Rate of Climb: $R/C_1 = \\frac{V_1(T_{A1} - D_1)}{W_1}$\n\nThe problem states that the aircraft experiences a 10% drop in thrust, so $T_{A2} = 0.9 \\times T_{A1}$.\nIt also states that a 'new equilibrium is reached at the same speed', which implies $V_2 = V_1$. Since the speed is the same, and assuming the altitude is also effectively the same (or changes negligibly for drag calculation), the drag $D$ will remain approximately constant, so $D_2 = D_1 = D$. The weight $W$ also remains constant, $W_2 = W_1 = W$.\n\nNew Rate of Climb: $R/C_2 = \\frac{V(T_{A2} - D)}{W} = \\frac{V(0.9 T_{A1} - D)}{W}$\n\nTo compare the new rate of climb with the old, we take the ratio:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{\\frac{V(0.9 T_{A1} - D)}{W}}{\\frac{V(T_{A1} - D)}{W}} = \\frac{0.9 T_{A1} - D}{T_{A1} - D}$\n\nLet $X = T_{A1} - D$. Since the aircraft is in a steady climb, $T_{A1}$ must be greater than $D$, so $X > 0$. Also, $D > 0$.\nWe can rewrite $T_{A1} = X + D$.\n\nSubstitute this into the ratio:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{0.9(X + D) - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X + 0.9D - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X - 0.1D}{X}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = 0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$\n\nSince $D > 0$ and $X > 0$, the term $\\frac{0.1D}{X}$ is a positive value. Therefore, $\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} < 0.9$.\n\nThis means that the new rate of climb ($R/C_2$) is less than 90% of the original rate of climb ($R/C_1$). A drop of exactly 10% would mean $R/C_2 = 0.9 \\times R/C_1$. Since $R/C_2$ is even smaller than $0.9 \\times R/C_1$, the new rate of climb is lower by *more than* 10%."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the fundamental principle of Rate of Climb (R/C).** The R/C for an aircraft in steady, unaccelerated flight is determined by the excess power, which is the difference between power available ($P_A$) and power required ($P_R$). In terms of thrust, this translates to excess thrust ($T_A - D$) multiplied by velocity ($V$).",
          "**Step 2: Write down the governing equation for R/C.** The formula is $R/C = \\frac{V(T_A - D)}{W}$, where $T_A$ is thrust available, $D$ is drag (thrust required), $V$ is flight velocity, and $W$ is aircraft weight.",
          "**Step 3: Define the initial conditions.** Let the initial thrust be $T_{A1}$, initial drag $D_1$, initial speed $V_1$, and initial weight $W_1$. So, $R/C_1 = \\frac{V_1(T_{A1} - D_1)}{W_1}$.",
          "**Step 4: Define the new conditions after the perturbation.** The thrust drops by 10%, so $T_{A2} = 0.9 \\times T_{A1}$. The problem states 'at the same speed', so $V_2 = V_1$. Assuming constant speed and altitude, the drag $D$ remains constant ($D_2 = D_1 = D$). The aircraft's weight $W$ also remains constant ($W_2 = W_1 = W$).",
          "**Step 5: Formulate the equation for the new R/C.** Using the new conditions, $R/C_2 = \\frac{V(0.9 T_{A1} - D)}{W}$.",
          "**Step 6: Compare the new R/C to the initial R/C by taking their ratio.** $\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{0.9 T_{A1} - D}{T_{A1} - D}$.",
          "**Step 7: Analyze the ratio algebraically.** Let $X = T_{A1} - D$. Since the aircraft is climbing, $T_{A1} > D$, so $X$ is a positive value. The ratio can be rewritten as $\\frac{0.9(X + D) - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X + 0.9D - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X - 0.1D}{X} = 0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$.",
          "**Step 8: Conclude based on the analysis.** Since $D > 0$ and $X > 0$, the term $\\frac{0.1D}{X}$ is positive. Therefore, $0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$ must be less than $0.9$. This implies $R/C_2 < 0.9 \\times R/C_1$, meaning the new rate of climb is lower by more than 10%."
