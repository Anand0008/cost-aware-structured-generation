All given parameters are directly used in this mass balance equation. The key steps are correct unit conversions (Pascals for pressure, m/s for burning rate, m^2 for area) and accurate calculation of the burning rate using the power law, followed by solving for the throat area and then diameter. The calculated diameter of approximately 37.65 mm rounds to 38 mm, matching option B."
