        "reasoning": "The aircraft range is governed by the Breguet Range Equation. For a given aircraft, in steady, level flight, the range ($R$) can be expressed as:\n$$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_0}{W_f}\\right)$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant that depends on aerodynamic efficiency ($L/D$), propulsive efficiency (or overall efficiency), and specific fuel consumption (or heat of combustion). $W_0$ is the initial aircraft weight (empty weight + fuel weight), and $W_f$ is the final aircraft weight (empty weight).\n\nTo analyze the effect of fuel reduction, it's often convenient to express the range in terms of the fuel mass fraction, $f_m$. The fuel mass fraction is defined as the ratio of fuel weight to initial aircraft weight:\n$$f_m = \\frac{W_{fuel}}{W_0} = \\frac{W_0 - W_f}{W_0}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the weight ratio $W_0/W_f$ as:\n$$\\frac{W_0}{W_f} = \\frac{1}{1 - f_m}$$\nSubstituting this into the Breguet Range Equation:\n$$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - f_m}\\right) = -K \\ln(1 - f_m)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the function $g(f_m) = -K \\ln(1 - f_m)$ for $0 < f_m < 1$ (since fuel mass fraction must be positive and less than 1). To understand how a change in $f_m$ affects $R$, we examine the second derivative of $g(f_m)$:\n$$g'(f_m) = -K \\left(\\frac{-1}{1 - f_m}\\right) = \\frac{K}{1 - f_m}$$\n$$g''(f_m) = K \\frac{1}{(1 - f_m)^2}$$\nSince $K$ is a positive constant and $(1 - f_m)^2$ is always positive for $f_m \\neq 1$, $g''(f_m)$ is always positive. This indicates that the function $R(f_m)$ is a **convex function**.\n\nA property of convex functions is that for a given percentage decrease in the input variable, the output variable decreases by a *larger* percentage. Conversely, for a given percentage increase in the input, the output increases by a *smaller* percentage.\n\nIn this question, the aircraft takes off with \"10% less fuel\". Interpreting this as a 10% reduction in the fuel mass fraction ($f_m$), i.e., $f_{m,new} = 0.9 f_{m,std}$:\nSince $R(f_m)$ is a convex function, a 10% decrease in $f_m$ will result in a decrease in range $R$ that is **more than 10%**.\n\n**Example:** Let $f_{m,std} = 0.5$ (a common fuel fraction for long-range aircraft, meaning fuel weight equals empty weight). Let $K=1$ for simplicity.\n$R_{std} = -\\ln(1 - 0.5) = -\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$\nIf fuel is reduced by 10%, $f_{m,new} = 0.9 \\times 0.5 = 0.45$.\n$R_{new} = -\\ln(1 - 0.45) = -\\ln(0.55) = \\ln(1/0.55) \\approx 0.592$\nPercentage decrease in range $= \\frac{R_{std} - R_{new}}{R_{std}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.693 - 0.592}{0.693} \\times 100\\% \\approx 14.57\\%$.\nSince $14.57\\% > 10\\%$, the range is lower by more than 10%."

          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle for aircraft range, which is the Breguet Range Equation.",

          "Step 3: Introduce the fuel mass fraction, $f_m = (W_0 - W_f)/W_0$, which represents the proportion of the initial aircraft weight that is fuel. Rearrange this to express the weight ratio $W_0/W_f$ in terms of $f_m$, yielding $W_0/W_f = 1/(1-f_m)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute this expression for the weight ratio back into the Breguet Range Equation: $R = K \\ln(1/(1-f_m)) = -K \\ln(1-f_m)$.",

          "Step 6: Determine the convexity or concavity of the function. Since $g''(x) > 0$ for $0 < x < 1$ (as $K>0$), the function $R(f_m)$ is convex.",
