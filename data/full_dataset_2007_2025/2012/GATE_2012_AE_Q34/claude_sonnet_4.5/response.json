        "reasoning": "The Breguet range equation shows that range is proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio of initial to final aircraft weight (W0/W1). Since the aircraft takes off with 10% less fuel, the initial weight (W0) will be lower by 10%, but the final weight (W1) after fuel consumption will also be lower by 10%. This means the ratio W0/W1 will decrease by more than 10%, leading to a range reduction of more than 10%."

          "Recognize that if the aircraft takes off with 10% less fuel, the initial weight $W_0$ will be 10% lower.",
          "However, the final weight $W_1$ will also be 10% lower since less fuel is consumed.",
          "Substituting the reduced $W_0$ and $W_1$ into the Breguet equation shows that the range will decrease by more than 10%, as the ratio $W_0/W_1$ will decrease by more than 10%.",
