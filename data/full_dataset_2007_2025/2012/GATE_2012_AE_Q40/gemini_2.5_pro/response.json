We need to find the fuel-to-air ratio ($f$).",

For a steady-flow, adiabatic combustion chamber, the energy balance is given by: $\\dot{m}_a h_{03} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) h_{04}$. Using $h_0 = c_p T_0$, this becomes: $\\dot{m}_a c_{p,a} T_{03} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$.",
          "Step 3: Define the fuel-to-air ratio ($f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$) and divide the energy balance equation by $\\dot{m}_a$ to express it in terms of $f$: $c_{p,a} T_{03} + f Q_R = (1 + f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$.",

Chunks 4, 5, and 6 were less directly applicable to this specific calculation but provided general background on stagnation properties and gas dynamics."
