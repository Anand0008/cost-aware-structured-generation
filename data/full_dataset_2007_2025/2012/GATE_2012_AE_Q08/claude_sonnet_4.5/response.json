This is because the Hohmann transfer is designed to be tangent to both the initial and final circular orbits, with the apogee of the transfer ellipse aligned with the higher orbit (Mars) and the perigee aligned with the lower orbit (Earth). This minimizes the required velocity changes for the transfer."
