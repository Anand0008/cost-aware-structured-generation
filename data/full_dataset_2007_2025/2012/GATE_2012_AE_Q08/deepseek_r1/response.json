        "reasoning": "A Hohmann transfer is an elliptical orbit used to move between two circular, coplanar orbits around a primary body (here, the Sun) with the minimum energy (delta-V). The transfer ellipse is tangential to both orbits. For a transfer from an inner circular orbit (Earth) to an outer circular orbit (Mars), the spacecraft departs from the inner orbit at the transfer ellipse's periapsis (closest point to the Sun) and arrives at the outer orbit at the ellipse's apoapsis (farthest point from the Sun). Therefore, the transfer ellipse has its perigee (perihelion in heliocentric terms) at Earth's orbital radius and its apogee (aphelion) at Mars's orbital radius. This is a fundamental and standard definition."

          "Step 2: Recall the definition of a Hohmann transfer orbit. It is an elliptical orbit used for the minimum-energy transfer between two coplanar circular orbits. The ellipse is tangent to both circles.",
          "Step 3: Visualize the geometry. The smaller circle (Earth's orbit) touches the ellipse at its point of closest approach to the Sun (periapsis/ perihelion). The larger circle (Mars's orbit) touches the ellipse at its point of farthest distance from the Sun (apoapsis/ aphelion).",
          "Step 4: Apply the terminology. In orbital mechanics, 'perigee' and 'apogee' are often used generically for the closest and farthest points in an orbit, even when the central body is not Earth. The question uses these terms relative to the Sun for the transfer ellipse. Thus, 'perigee' corresponds to the inner orbital radius (Earth) and 'apogee' to the outer orbital radius (Mars).",
          "Step 5: Match the conclusion to the options. The correct description is 'apogee at Mars and perigee at earth.'"
