        "reasoning": "A Hohmann transfer is the most fuel-efficient two-impulse maneuver used to transfer a spacecraft between two coplanar circular orbits. When transferring from an inner orbit to an outer orbit (e.g., from Earth's orbit around the Sun to Mars' orbit around the Sun), the transfer ellipse must be tangential to both the initial and final circular orbits. For the transfer ellipse to be tangential to the inner orbit (Earth's orbit), its perigee (the point closest to the central body, which is the Sun in this case) must coincide with the radius of Earth's orbit. Similarly, for the transfer ellipse to be tangential to the outer orbit (Mars' orbit), its apogee (the point farthest from the central body) must coincide with the radius of Mars' orbit. Therefore, the Hohmann ellipse for an Earth-Mars transfer has its perigee at Earth and its apogee at Mars."

          "Step 2: Identify the central body and the initial/final orbits for an Earth-Mars transfer. The central body is the Sun. Earth is in an inner, smaller circular orbit, and Mars is in an outer, larger circular orbit.",
          "Step 3: Recall the definitions of perigee and apogee in an elliptical orbit. Perigee (or periapsis) is the point in an orbit where the spacecraft is closest to the central body. Apogee (or apoapsis) is the point where it is farthest from the central body.",
          "Step 4: Apply the tangency condition for a Hohmann transfer from an inner to an outer orbit. For the transfer ellipse to be tangential to the initial, inner orbit (Earth's orbit), its perigee must be at the radius of Earth's orbit. This is where the first impulse is applied.",
          "Step 5: For the transfer ellipse to be tangential to the final, outer orbit (Mars' orbit), its apogee must be at the radius of Mars' orbit. This is where the second impulse is applied to circularize the orbit at Mars' radius.",
          "Step 6: Conclude based on these conditions. The Hohmann ellipse for an Earth-Mars transfer will have its perigee at Earth's orbit and its apogee at Mars' orbit."
