        "reasoning": "The given information states that the thin-walled spherical vessel has a diameter of 1 m and a wall thickness of 10 mm, and the material has a yield strength of 500 MPa in both tension and compression. Using the Von Mises yield criterion, the internal pressure at which the vessel will yield can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. The principal stresses for a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel are:\n   - Major principal stress: $\\sigma_1 = \\frac{p_i r}{t}$\n   - Minor principal stresses: $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = \\frac{p_i r}{2t}$\n\n2. Applying the Von Mises yield criterion:\n   $\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2}{2}} = \\sigma_Y$\n\n3. Substituting the given values:\n   $\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.005} - \\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.01})^2 + (\\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.01} - \\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.01})^2 + (\\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.01} - \\frac{p_i \\times 0.5}{0.005})^2}{2}} = 500 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n4. Solving for the internal pressure $p_i$:\n   $p_i = \\frac{2 \\times 500 \\text{ MPa} \\times 0.005 \\text{ m}}{0.5 \\text{ m}} = 20 \\text{ MPa}$\n\nTherefore, the internal pressure at which the vessel will yield, based on the Von Mises yield criterion, is approximately 20 MPa, which matches the correct answer choice D."
