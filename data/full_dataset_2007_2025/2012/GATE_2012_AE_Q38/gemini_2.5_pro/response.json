        "reasoning": "The question addresses the 'starting difficulty' in a supersonic wind tunnel with a C-D nozzle and a C-D diffuser. During startup, a normal shock wave forms. The key principles are:\n\n1.  **Stagnation Pressure Loss across a Normal Shock:** A normal shock wave causes a significant loss in stagnation pressure. This means the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock (`P_{0,diffuser}`) is lower than the stagnation pressure upstream (`P_{0,nozzle}`). (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4)\n2.  **Choked Mass Flow Rate:** The maximum mass flow rate through a choked throat is proportional to the stagnation pressure upstream of that throat and its area (`$\\dot{m}_{choked} \\propto P_0 A_{throat} / \\sqrt{T_0}$`). (RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4)\n3.  **Mass Flow Matching for Startup:** For the tunnel to start and the shock to be 'swallowed', the mass flow rate that the nozzle throat can pass must be equal to or less than what the diffuser throat can 'swallow'. Since `P_{0,diffuser} < P_{0,nozzle}` due to the shock, to maintain the same mass flow rate (assuming constant stagnation temperature), the diffuser throat area (`A_{throat,diffuser}`) must be larger than the nozzle throat area (`A_{throat,nozzle}`). Specifically, `A_{throat,diffuser} = A_{throat,nozzle} \\times (P_{0,nozzle} / P_{0,diffuser})`. Since `(P_{0,nozzle} / P_{0,diffuser}) > 1`, it implies `A_{throat,diffuser} > A_{throat,nozzle}`. (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)\n4.  **Shock Location for 'Swallowing':** The term 'swallow the starting shock' implies that the shock, which initially forms in the divergent section of the nozzle or test section, must be pushed downstream through the diffuser throat. Once it has passed through the diffuser throat and stable supersonic flow is established in the test section, the shock will reside downstream of the diffuser throat, typically in the divergent section of the diffuser or further downstream, where the flow decelerates subsonically. (RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4)\n\nCombining these points:\n*   The diffuser throat must be **larger than the nozzle throat**.\n*   For the shock to be 'swallowed' and the tunnel to be operating stably, the shock must be located **downstream of the diffuser throat**.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice."

          "Step 1: Understand the 'starting difficulty' in supersonic wind tunnels. This refers to the challenge of establishing stable supersonic flow in the test section due to the formation of a normal shock wave during the startup phase.",
          "Step 2: Identify the primary cause of starting difficulty: the normal shock wave that forms in the flow path. This shock causes a significant loss in stagnation pressure (`$P_0$`).",
          "Step 3: Relate the stagnation pressure loss to the mass flow capacity of the diffuser throat. The maximum mass flow rate through a choked throat is directly proportional to the stagnation pressure upstream of that throat. Since the diffuser throat is downstream of the shock, the stagnation pressure available to drive flow through it (`$P_{0,diffuser}$`) is lower than the stagnation pressure upstream of the nozzle throat (`$P_{0,nozzle}$`).",
          "Step 4: Determine the required relative size of the diffuser throat. To maintain the same mass flow rate through both throats (which is necessary for continuous flow), if `$P_{0,diffuser} < P_{0,nozzle}$`, then the diffuser throat area (`$A_{throat,diffuser}$`) must be larger than the nozzle throat area (`$A_{throat,nozzle}$`) to compensate for the reduced stagnation pressure. This ensures the diffuser can 'swallow' the mass flow supplied by the nozzle.",
          "Step 5: Determine the desired location of the shock for 'swallowing'. For the tunnel to be considered 'started' and the shock 'swallowed', the shock must have successfully passed through the diffuser throat. This means its stable position will be downstream of the diffuser throat, typically in the divergent section of the diffuser or further towards the exhaust, where the flow becomes subsonic."

All key aspects of the question were covered comprehensively by the RAG context."
