        "reasoning": "In a closed-circuit supersonic wind tunnel with a C-D nozzle, test section, and C-D diffuser, the diffuser must be able to swallow the starting normal shock and still pass the mass flow. Across the normal shock, there is a loss in total pressure, so the downstream throat (diffuser throat) must have a larger area than the nozzle throat to pass the same mass flow when choked: $\\dot{m}_{\\text{choked}} \\propto p_0 A_t / \\sqrt{T_0}$. Since $p_{0,\\text{diffuser}} < p_{0,\\text{nozzle}}$ due to shock losses, we need $A_{t,\\text{diffuser}} > A_{t,\\text{nozzle}}$ to keep $\\dot{m}$ the same. For the tunnel to be properly started, the normal shock must be located inside the diffuser, downstream of its throat, so that the test section remains fully supersonic and the diffuser operates as a supersonic-to-subsonic decelerator. If the shock sits at the diffuser throat, the diffuser chokes with the shock sitting there and the tunnel tends to be marginal/unstarted. Therefore, the correct condition is: diffuser throat larger than nozzle throat and shock located downstream of the diffuser throat, which is option B."

          "name": "Quantitative mass flow comparison using choked-flow formula",
          "description": "Instead of purely qualitative reasoning, explicitly write the choked mass flow rate for the nozzle throat and diffuser throat: $\\dot{m}_1 = C p_{0,1} A_{t,1} / \\sqrt{T_{0,1}}$ and $\\dot{m}_2 = C p_{0,2} A_{t,2} / \\sqrt{T_{0,2}}$. Use the normal shock relation to find $p_{0,2}/p_{0,1}$ for a representative Mach number at the shock, then solve for the required ratio $A_{t,2}/A_{t,1}$ to keep $\\dot{m}_1 = \\dot{m}_2$. This shows quantitatively that $A_{t,2} > A_{t,1}$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Gives a concrete numerical sense of how much larger the diffuser throat must be; reinforces choked-flow and shock relations. Cons: More time-consuming and not necessary for a conceptual MCQ; requires remembering or looking up normal shock tables.",

          "description": "Use the area–Mach number relation qualitatively: in a C-D nozzle, flow accelerates to supersonic; in a C-D diffuser, supersonic flow must first pass through a converging section to approach Mach 1, then a throat, then a diverging section to become subsonic. Place the normal shock in the diverging part of the diffuser where Mach number is still supersonic but decreasing, ensuring the test section remains supersonic and the diffuser can handle the shock.",
