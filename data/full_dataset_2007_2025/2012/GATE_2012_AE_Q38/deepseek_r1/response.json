        "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. The principle of 'starting difficulty' in a supersonic wind tunnel with a C-D diffuser dictates that the diffuser throat must be larger than the nozzle throat to compensate for the stagnation pressure loss across the starting normal shock. This larger area allows the diffuser to 'swallow' the shock mass flow. Once started, for stable operation, the shock is located downstream of the diffuser throat, typically in the diverging section where it weakens (often becoming an oblique shock system). Options A, C, and D are incorrect because a throat of the same size cannot pass the required mass flow after the shock loss (C, D), and locating the shock at the diffuser throat (A) is an unstable transient condition, not the designed operating state."

For the nozzle throat (upstream of shock) and diffuser throat (downstream of shock), if areas are equal, the mass flow capacity of the diffuser throat is reduced due to lower $P_0$.",
          "Step 4: Determine the design fix - To match mass flows and allow the shock to pass, the diffuser throat area ($A_{t,\\text{diff}}$) must be larger than the nozzle throat area ($A_{t,\\text{noz}}$) to compensate: $A_{t,\\text{diff}} = A_{t,\\text{noz}} \\times (P_{0,\\text{noz}} / P_{0,\\text{diff}})$.",
          "Step 5: Identify the stable operating condition - After 'swallowing', the shock moves downstream of the diffuser throat into the diverging section, where the flow is subsonic and can decelerate further. The shock is not held at the throat in steady operation.",
