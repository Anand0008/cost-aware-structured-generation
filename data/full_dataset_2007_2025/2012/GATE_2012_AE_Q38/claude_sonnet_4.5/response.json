This configuration is necessary to overcome the starting difficulty in a supersonic wind tunnel.\n\nDuring the startup phase, a normal shock wave inevitably forms in the diffuser. The stagnation pressure loss across this shock reduces the effective pressure available to drive flow through the diffuser throat. This creates a mismatch between the maximum mass flow rate that the nozzle throat can pass versus what the diffuser throat (with the shock upstream) can 'swallow'. \n\nTo compensate for this, the diffuser throat area must be larger than the nozzle throat area. This allows the diffuser to 'swallow' the normal shock and establish stable supersonic flow in the test section. If the diffuser throat were the same size as the nozzle throat (option C), or if the shock were located at the diffuser throat (options A and C), the diffuser would not be able to accommodate the mass flow rate from the nozzle, preventing the tunnel from starting."
