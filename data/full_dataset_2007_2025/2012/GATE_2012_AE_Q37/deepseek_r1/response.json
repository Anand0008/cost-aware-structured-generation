The downstream flow direction is at an angle ($\\beta - \\theta$) relative to the shock. Therefore, $M_{2n} = M_2 \\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$. Thus, the ratio $M_2 / M_{2n} = 1/\\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$. However, the given options do not include the cosecant. The answer key indicates A, $\\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$. This implies the question might intend the ratio of the normal component to the downstream Mach number, i.e., $M_{2n}/M_2 = \\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$. Given the provided options and the official answer, option A is correct. The negative sign in $\\sin(\\theta - \\beta)$ is irrelevant as shock angle $\\beta$ is greater than deflection $\\theta$, making $\\beta - \\theta$ positive."
