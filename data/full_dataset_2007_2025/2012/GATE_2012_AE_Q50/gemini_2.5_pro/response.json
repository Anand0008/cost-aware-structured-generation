        "reasoning": "The problem describes fluid emerging radially from a porous pipe, which is a classic example of a two-dimensional (2D) source flow. For an incompressible, irrotational 2D source flow, the radial velocity component ($V_r$) is inversely proportional to the radial distance ($r$) from the source. This relationship is given by the formula $V_r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}$ or, more simply, $V_r = \\frac{C}{r}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the source strength and $C$ is a constant.\n\nGiven data:\n1.  Pipe diameter = 10 mm, so the radius of the pipe (where fluid emerges) is $r_1 = \\frac{10 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 5 \\text{ mm} = 0.005 \\text{ m}$.\n2.  Radial velocity at the pipe surface is $V_{r1} = 1 \\text{ m/s}$.\n3.  We need to find the radial velocity $V_{r2}$ at a radial location $r_2 = 0.5 \\text{ m}$.\n\nUsing the inverse proportionality $V_r \\cdot r = C$ (constant):\n$V_{r1} \\cdot r_1 = V_{r2} \\cdot r_2$\n$1 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.005 \\text{ m} = V_{r2} \\cdot 0.5 \\text{ m}$\n\nSolving for $V_{r2}$:\n$V_{r2} = \\frac{1 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.005 \\text{ m}}{0.5 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{0.005}{0.5} \\text{ m/s} = 0.01 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nThe information about the pipe spinning at 60 rpm is a distractor for the calculation of the *radial* velocity component. In an ideal source flow, the radial velocity field is independent of any tangential motion of the source itself."

          "**Step 4: Determine the constant $C$.** Using the given conditions at the pipe surface ($r_1, V_{r1}$):\n    $C = V_{r1} \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.005 \\text{ m} = 0.005 \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$.",
