        "reasoning": "The question states that the fluid is pumped out of the pipe at a radial velocity of 1 m/s. Since the pipe is spinning at 60 rpm, the tangential velocity of the fluid at the pipe surface is given by the formula $V_\theta = \\omega r$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi \times 60/60 = \\pi$ rad/s and $r = 0.005$ m (half the pipe diameter). Substituting these values, we get $V_\theta = \\pi \times 0.005 = 0.0157$ m/s. \n\nThe radial velocity component $V_r$ is given by the formula $V_r = \\Lambda / (2\\pi r)$, where $\\Lambda$ is the source strength. Since the radial velocity at the pipe surface is 1 m/s, we can solve for $\\Lambda$:\n$1 = \\Lambda / (2\\pi \times 0.005)$\n$\\Lambda = 2\\pi \times 0.005 = 0.0314$ m²/s\n\nNow, to find the radial velocity at a radial location of 0.5 m, we can substitute the values into the formula:\n$V_r = \\Lambda / (2\\pi r) = 0.0314 / (2\\pi \times 0.5) = 0.01$ m/s\n\nTherefore, the radial component of the fluid's velocity at a radial location of 0.5 m from the pipe axis is 0.01 m/s, which matches the correct answer A."
