A schlieren system measures the angular deflection of a light ray, proportional to the first derivative `dn/dy`. A shadowgraph projects displaced rays onto a screen, where the intensity variation results from the convergence/divergence of rays, which is related to the rate of change of deflection, i.e., the second derivative `d^2n/dy^2`.",
