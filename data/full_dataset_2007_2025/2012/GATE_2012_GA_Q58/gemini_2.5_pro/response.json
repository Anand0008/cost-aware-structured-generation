This implies that the existing measures are already in a state where adding another negative one won't significantly worsen the situation or public perception. Let's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. reflective:** Means thoughtful or considering. This does not fit the context of 'unreasonable measure' or the idea that 'one more would hardly make a difference.'\n*   **B. utopian:** Means idealistic or perfect. This is the opposite of what is implied by 'unreasonable measure.'\n*   **C. luxuriant:** Means rich, abundant, or lush. This word is completely out of context for describing administrative measures.\n*   **D. unpopular:** Means disliked by many. If the measures are already unpopular, adding 'yet another unreasonable measure' would indeed 'hardly make a difference' to their existing unpopularity. This option perfectly fits the logical flow and implied meaning of the sentence."

          "Step 3: Analyze the phrase 'one more would hardly make a difference.' This phrase suggests that the current state of the measures is already negative or undesirable to the point where an additional negative measure won't significantly alter the perception or impact.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each option in the context of the sentence:\n    *   'reflective' (thoughtful) does not align with 'unreasonable measure' or the idea of not making a difference.\n    *   'utopian' (idealistic) contradicts 'unreasonable measure.'\n    *   'luxuriant' (abundant/lush) is semantically irrelevant.\n    *   'unpopular' (disliked by many) fits perfectly. If measures are already unpopular, adding another unreasonable one would indeed 'hardly make a difference' to their already negative reception.",
          "Step 5: Select the option that logically and semantically completes the sentence, making it coherent and consistent with the implied meaning. Option D, 'unpopular,' is the most appropriate choice."
