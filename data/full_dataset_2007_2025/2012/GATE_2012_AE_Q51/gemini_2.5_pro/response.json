Based on standard inviscid fluid dynamics principles (conservation of angular momentum for a free vortex outside the pipe), the tangential velocity at $r = 0.5$ m is calculated as $0.0001\\pi \\approx 0.000314$ m/s. This value is not among the given options. However, if the question implicitly intended to ask for the tangential velocity *at the pipe surface* ($r = R_{pipe}$), then $V_{\\theta}(R_{pipe}) = \\omega R_{pipe} = 0.01\\pi \\approx 0.0314$ m/s, which is very close to Option B (0.03 m/s). Given the 'Marks to All' status, it's highly probable that the question was ambiguous or the options were incorrect for the stated radial location, but Option B might have been the intended answer based on a partial or misinterpreted calculation."
