Mass conservation gives V_r(r) = V_r(R) * (R/r). Angular momentum conservation (rV_θ constant) gives V_θ(r) = ωR² / r. Substituting r = 0.5 m yields V_θ ≈ 0.000314 m/s. This value is not among the options (0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.31 m/s), likely due to a possible unit misinterpretation or typo in the problem, leading to the 'Marks to All' decision."

          "Step 2: Determine radial velocity component V_r at r = 0.5 m using mass conservation for steady, incompressible, axisymmetric flow. Mass flow rate through any cylindrical surface is constant: ρ(2πrL)V_r = constant. At pipe surface (r = R), V_r(R) = 1 m/s (given, absolute radial velocity). Thus, V_r(r) = V_r(R) × (R/r) = 1 × (0.005/0.5) = 0.01 m/s. (This answers linked Q50.)",
          "Step 3: Determine tangential velocity component V_θ at the pipe surface. Since fluid emerges radially relative to the pipe surface (no relative tangential velocity), in the absolute frame, it acquires the tangential velocity of the pipe due to no-slip. Thus, at r = R, V_θ(R) = ωR = 2π × 0.005 ≈ 0.03142 m/s.",
          "Step 4: Apply conservation of angular momentum for inviscid flow (no external torques). The angular momentum per unit mass (rV_θ) remains constant along a streamline. Thus, r V_θ(r) = R V_θ(R) = ωR².",
          "Step 5: Compute V_θ at r = 0.5 m: V_θ = (ωR²) / r = (2π × (0.005)²) / 0.5 = (2π × 2.5e-5) / 0.5 = 5πe-5 / 0.5 = 10πe-5 ≈ 3.1416e-4 m/s = 0.00031416 m/s.",
          "Step 6: Compare with given options: A (0.01 m/s), B (0.03 m/s), C (0.10 m/s), D (0.31 m/s). The calculated value is orders of magnitude smaller, suggesting a possible error in problem interpretation or units. The official answer 'Marks to All' indicates all options were accepted, likely due to this discrepancy."
