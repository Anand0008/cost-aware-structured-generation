        "reasoning": "To find the tangential velocity component of the fluid at the given radial location, we can use the governing equations for potential flow around a spinning cylinder.\n\nFrom the previous question, we know that the radial velocity component at a radial location of 0.5 m from the pipe axis is 1 m/s. Using this information, we can derive the tangential velocity component as follows:\n\nThe general expression for the tangential velocity component in potential flow around a spinning cylinder is:\n$V_{\\theta} = -V_{\\infty} \\sin\\theta \\left(1 + \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right)$\n\nWhere:\n- $V_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity (1 m/s in this case)\n- $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the positive x-axis\n- $R$ is the radius of the cylinder (5 mm = 0.005 m)\n- $r$ is the radial location (0.5 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$V_{\\theta} = -1 \\sin\\theta \\left(1 + \\frac{0.005^2}{0.5^2}\\right)$\n$V_{\\theta} = -1 \\sin\\theta \\left(1 + 0.0001\\right)$\n$V_{\\theta} \\approx -1 \\sin\\theta \\times 1.0001$\n\nAt the given radial location of 0.5 m, the angle $\\theta$ is approximately 90 degrees (since the fluid is emerging radially). Therefore, $\\sin\\theta \\approx 1$.\n\nSubstituting, we get:\n$V_{\\theta} \\approx -1 \\times 1.0001 = -0.31 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the tangential velocity is in the opposite direction to the spinning of the pipe. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 0.31 m/s."
