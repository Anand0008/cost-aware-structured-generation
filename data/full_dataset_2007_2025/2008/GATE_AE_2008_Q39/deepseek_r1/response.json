Under the assumption of steady, level flight ($L=W$), the velocity $V$ is related to the lift coefficient $C_L$. For a parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, the condition for maximum range is achieved by flying at the velocity that maximizes the ratio $C_L^{1/2}/C_D$, which corresponds to a specific $C_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{D0}}{3K}}$. This is a standard result in aircraft performance, explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5). Option A ($C_L/C_D$) is the condition for maximum endurance for a jet, not range. Options C and D correspond to conditions for propeller aircraft (max endurance and max range, respectively)."
