        "reasoning": "In a cruise-climb (also known as optimal cruise-climb for jet aircraft), the aircraft climbs gradually as fuel burns to maintain maximum range. The standard flight condition for maximum range of a jet aircraft is to hold equivalent airspeed (EAS) and lift coefficient (C_L) constant. This is derived from the Breguet range equation for jets, where flying at constant C_L (corresponding to maximum lift-to-drag ratio) and constant EAS minimizes fuel consumption per unit distance. As weight decreases, altitude increases to reduce density, keeping EAS and C_L constant. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: altitude increases, true airspeed changes, and aircraft mass decreases due to fuel burn."

          "Step 1: Understand cruise-climb. It is a flight condition where an aircraft gradually climbs during cruise to maintain optimal performance (maximum range for a jet) as weight decreases due to fuel burn.",

          "Step 3: Define equivalent airspeed: V_e = V * sqrt(\\rho / \\rho_0), where V is true airspeed, \\rho is density at altitude, and \\rho_0 is sea-level density. Holding V_e constant compensates for density changes with altitude.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the lift equation in steady flight: L = W = 0.5 * \\rho * V^2 * S * C_L. Rewrite using V_e: W = 0.5 * \\rho_0 * V_e^2 * S * C_L. For constant V_e and C_L, the right side is constant, but weight W decreases. In cruise-climb, the aircraft is in a shallow climb, so lift approximately equals weight (L ≈ W cos(\\gamma) with small \\gamma). As W decreases, the climb angle \\gamma adjusts to maintain force balance, allowing V_e and C_L to remain constant.",
          "Step 5: Eliminate other options. Altitude changes (so B and C are wrong). Aircraft mass decreases (so D is wrong). True airspeed changes with altitude to keep V_e constant. Thus, only equivalent airspeed and lift coefficient remain constant."
