During a cruise-climb, the aircraft maintains a constant equivalent airspeed (which is related to true airspeed and altitude) and a constant lift coefficient. This is because in a steady, unaccelerated climb, the lift must equal the component of the aircraft's weight perpendicular to the flight path, which is W*cos(gamma), where gamma is the climb angle. The lift coefficient required for this condition is lower than the lift coefficient required for level cruise flight at the same speed, as shown in the formulas derived in the retrieved knowledge."
