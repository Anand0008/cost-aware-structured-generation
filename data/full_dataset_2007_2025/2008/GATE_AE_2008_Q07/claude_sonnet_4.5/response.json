The horizontal component of lift is given by L * sin(φ), where φ is the bank angle.\n\nFrom the definition of load factor, we can write:\n$L = n \\cdot W$\nThe horizontal component of lift is then:\n$L \\cdot \\sin(\\phi) = n \\cdot W \\cdot \\sin(\\phi)$\n\nDividing the horizontal component of lift by the aircraft weight W, we get:\n$\\frac{L \\cdot \\sin(\\phi)}{W} = n \\cdot \\sin(\\phi)$\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\phi) = \\sqrt{{1 - \\cos^2(\\phi)}}$, we can rewrite this as:\n$\\frac{L \\cdot \\sin(\\phi)}{W} = n \\cdot \\sqrt{{1 - \\cos^2(\\phi)}} = \\sqrt{{n^2 - 1}}$\n\nThus, the ratio of the horizontal component of lift to the aircraft weight is $\\sqrt{{n^2 - 1}}$, which matches the correct answer C."
