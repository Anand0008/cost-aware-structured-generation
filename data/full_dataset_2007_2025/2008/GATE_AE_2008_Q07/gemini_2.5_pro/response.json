A vertical component to balance the aircraft's weight (W).\n2.  A horizontal component to provide the centripetal force required for the turn.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be the bank angle.\n\nFrom the vertical force balance (maintaining level flight):\n$L \\cos(\\phi) = W$ (Equation 1)\n\nThe load factor 'n' is defined as the ratio of lift to weight:\n$n = \\frac{L}{W}$ (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express lift as $L = \\frac{W}{\\cos(\\phi)}$.\nSubstituting this into Equation 2:\n$n = \\frac{W / \\cos(\\phi)}{W} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\phi)}$\nTherefore, $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the horizontal component of lift to the aircraft weight.

          "Step 1: Understand the flight condition. The question specifies 'steady, level turning flight'. This means the aircraft is maintaining constant altitude and speed while changing direction. The forces must be balanced in the vertical direction, and a net centripetal force must exist in the horizontal plane.",
          "Step 2: Define Load Factor. The load factor 'n' is given as the ratio of lift (L) to weight (W), i.e., $n = L/W$. This implies $L = nW$.",
          "Step 3: Resolve forces in a level turn. For level flight, the vertical component of lift must balance the weight. If $\\phi$ is the bank angle, then $L \\cos(\\phi) = W$.",
          "Step 4: Relate bank angle to load factor. From $L \\cos(\\phi) = W$ and $L = nW$, substitute $L$ to get $(nW) \\cos(\\phi) = W$. This simplifies to $n \\cos(\\phi) = 1$, or $\\cos(\\phi) = 1/n$.",
          "Step 5: Identify the required ratio. The question asks for the ratio of the horizontal component of lift to the aircraft weight. The horizontal component of lift is $L \\sin(\\phi)$. So, the ratio is $\\frac{L \\sin(\\phi)}{W}$.",
          "Step 6: Express $\\sin(\\phi)$ in terms of 'n'. Use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\phi) = 1$. Substitute $\\cos(\\phi) = 1/n$:\n$\\sin^2(\\phi) = 1 - (1/n)^2 = 1 - 1/n^2 = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2}$\nTaking the square root, $\\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the final ratio. Substitute $L = nW$ and the expression for $\\sin(\\phi)$ into the ratio from Step 5:\nRatio $= \\frac{(nW) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}\\right)}{W} = \\sqrt{n^2 - 1}$.",
