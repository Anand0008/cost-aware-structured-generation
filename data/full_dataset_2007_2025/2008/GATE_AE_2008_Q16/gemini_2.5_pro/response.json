        "reasoning": "Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine, indicating how much thrust is generated per unit of propellant mass flow rate. A higher $I_{sp}$ means more efficient use of propellant. The general trend for common rocket propellants is that high-energy liquid propellants, especially those involving hydrogen, offer the highest $I_{sp}$, followed by hydrocarbon-based liquid propellants, and then solid propellants.\n\n1.  **Double Base (DB) Solid Propellant:** Solid propellants generally have the lowest specific impulse among the options due to their inherent chemical composition, lower combustion temperatures, and higher molecular weight of exhaust products compared to liquid propellants. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for solid propellants is in the range of 240-290 s.\n\n2.  **LOX-RP1 (Liquid Oxygen - Kerosene):** This is a widely used liquid bipropellant combination. Kerosene (RP-1) is a hydrocarbon fuel. While offering good density and storability, its combustion products (like $\\text{CO}_2$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{CO}$) have a higher average molecular weight compared to hydrogen-based propellants. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for LOX-RP1 is in the range of 330-360 s (Chunk 1, 2).\n\n3.  **LOX-LH$_2$ (Liquid Oxygen - Liquid Hydrogen):** This combination is known for providing the highest specific impulse among practical chemical propellants. Liquid hydrogen is the lightest element, and its combustion with oxygen produces water vapor ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) and sometimes unreacted $\\text{H}_2$ as exhaust products, which have a very low average molecular weight. This low molecular weight, combined with high combustion temperatures, results in very high exhaust velocities and thus high $I_{sp}$. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for LOX-LH$_2$ is in the range of 430-460 s (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 5).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of increasing specific impulse is DB < LOX-RP1 < LOX-LH$_2$."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$) as a primary performance metric for rocket propellants. It represents the thrust generated per unit weight flow rate of propellant, or equivalently, the exhaust velocity divided by standard gravity ($I_{sp} = V_e / g_0$). Higher $I_{sp}$ indicates greater propellant efficiency.",
          "Step 2: Recall the general performance characteristics of different classes of propellants. Solid propellants typically have lower $I_{sp}$ compared to liquid propellants due to factors like lower combustion temperatures and higher average molecular weight of exhaust products.",
          "Step 3: Compare the two liquid bipropellant combinations provided: LOX-RP1 (Liquid Oxygen - Kerosene) and LOX-LH$_2$ (Liquid Oxygen - Liquid Hydrogen). From fundamental principles and common knowledge in aerospace propulsion, hydrogen-oxygen propellants are known to yield the highest $I_{sp}$ among practical chemical propellants.",
          "Step 4: Recognize that LOX-RP1, being a hydrocarbon-based fuel, produces exhaust products with a higher average molecular weight (e.g., $\\text{CO}_2$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{CO}$) compared to LOX-LH$_2$ (primarily $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{H}_2$). Lower molecular weight exhaust products lead to higher exhaust velocities and thus higher $I_{sp}$ (Chunk 1, 2).",
          "Step 5: Based on these comparisons, establish the increasing order of specific impulse: Double Base (solid) < LOX-RP1 (liquid hydrocarbon) < LOX-LH$_2$ (liquid cryogenic hydrogen)."
