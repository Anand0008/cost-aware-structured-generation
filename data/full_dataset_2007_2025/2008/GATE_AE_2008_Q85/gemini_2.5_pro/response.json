Therefore, a direct derivation of the value 5760 N.cm is not possible from the provided information. However, in structural mechanics, torque 'M' (often denoted as 'T') is typically determined by one of the following methods: \\n1.  **Equilibrium of forces and moments**: Summing moments about the longitudinal axis for a given section of a beam or shaft subjected to external loads (concentrated torques, distributed torques). This involves drawing a free body diagram and applying static equilibrium equations ($\\sum M_z = 0$).\\n2.  **Torsion formula**: Using the relationship $T = GJ \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus, $J$ is the torsion constant of the cross-section, and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$ is the rate of twist. This method requires knowing the material properties, cross-sectional geometry, and the deformation (rate of twist).\\n3.  **Integration of distributed torque**: If a distributed torque $T_i(z)$ is applied along the beam, the internal torque $T(z)$ can be found by integrating the differential equilibrium equation $\\frac{dT}{dz} = -T_i(z)$ (as shown in RAG Chunk 1).\\n\\nAssuming a typical problem involving torsion of a structural member, the calculation would involve identifying the applied loads and geometry, then applying the appropriate principle. The correct answer, as per the answer key, is B. 5760 N.cm. This value would be obtained by applying one of the aforementioned principles to the specific (unprovided) problem details."

However, the RAG context did not include the specific problem statement (geometry, loads, material properties) required to calculate the numerical value of 'M'. Therefore, the analysis had to rely on general principles and assumptions about a typical torsion problem."
