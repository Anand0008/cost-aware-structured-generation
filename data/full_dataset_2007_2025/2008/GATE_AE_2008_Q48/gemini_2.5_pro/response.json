        "reasoning": "The RAG context (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6) consistently highlights that the primary advantage of an oblique shock diffuser over a normal shock diffuser in supersonic wind tunnels is its ability to significantly reduce total pressure loss. A single strong normal shock causes the maximum possible total pressure loss for a given Mach number reduction. In contrast, an oblique shock diffuser is designed to decelerate the flow through a series of weaker oblique shocks, followed by a final weak normal shock, which results in much higher stagnation pressure recovery. This reduction in total pressure loss translates directly to lower operating costs and reduced reservoir pressure requirements for the wind tunnel. Options B and C are incorrect because a diffuser's purpose is to decelerate the flow, and oblique shocks achieve this more gradually and efficiently, not more rapidly. Option D is the opposite of the correct principle."
