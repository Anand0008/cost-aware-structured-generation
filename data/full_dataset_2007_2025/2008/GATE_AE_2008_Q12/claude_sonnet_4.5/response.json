Laminar flow airfoils are designed to maintain a laminar boundary layer over a large portion of the airfoil surface at low angles of attack, resulting in reduced skin friction drag. This is supported by the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, which states that laminar-flow airfoils are designed to maintain laminar flow over a large portion of their surface, leading to a characteristic 'drag bucket' with very low drag. As the angle of attack increases, flow separation eventually occurs, increasing pressure drag. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Skin friction drag."
