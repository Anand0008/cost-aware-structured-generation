A laminar boundary layer is characterized by smooth, orderly flow and exhibits significantly lower viscous shear stresses, and thus lower skin friction drag, compared to a turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, the primary purpose of laminar flow airfoils is to reduce skin friction drag. This is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge, particularly Chunk 4 and Chunk 6, which state that 'laminar-flow' airfoils are designed to maintain a laminar boundary layer to achieve very low drag and 'reducing skin-friction drag is critical for improving aerodynamic efficiency' by 'maintaining laminar flow'."

Turbulent boundary layers generally have a steeper velocity gradient at the wall, leading to higher shear stress and thus higher skin friction drag compared to laminar boundary layers at the same Reynolds number.",
