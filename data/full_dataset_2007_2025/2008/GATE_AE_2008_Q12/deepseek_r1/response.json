        "reasoning": "The primary design goal of a laminar flow airfoil is to maintain a laminar boundary layer over a larger portion of the chord compared to conventional airfoils. A laminar boundary layer produces significantly lower shear stress at the wall than a turbulent boundary layer, directly reducing skin friction drag. This is a well-established aerodynamic concept and is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 4, Chunk 6). Trim drag relates to control surface deflection for equilibrium; induced drag is a consequence of lift generation on finite wings and is reduced by high aspect ratio and wingtip devices; wave drag is associated with shock waves in transonic/supersonic flow and is reduced by sweep and area ruling."

(C) Induced drag is related to wing span and lift distribution, not primarily to airfoil shape in 2D. (D) Wave drag is relevant at high Mach numbers and is not the primary target of laminar flow airfoils. (B) Skin friction drag is directly minimized by maintaining a laminar boundary layer."
