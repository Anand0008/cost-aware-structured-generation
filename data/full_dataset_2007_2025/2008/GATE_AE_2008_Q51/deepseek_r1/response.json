Since the shock is attached to the leading edge, a smaller $\\beta$ means the shock wave is rotated closer to the body surface, i.e., it moves closer. This is a direct, textbook application of the shock-polar or $\\theta-\\beta-M$ charts."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the setup. A 2D body (like a wedge) at an angle of attack in supersonic flow creates an attached oblique shock. The body's geometry (specifically, the angle it presents to the flow) fixes the flow deflection angle $\\theta$ required to turn the flow parallel to its surface.",
          "Step 2: Recall the governing relationship. The shock angle $\\beta$ for an attached oblique shock is determined by the freestream Mach number $M_1$ and the deflection angle $\\theta$ via the implicit $\\theta-\\beta-M$ relation: $\\tan \\theta = 2 \\cot \\beta \\frac{M_1^2 \\sin^2 \\beta - 1}{M_1^2 (\\gamma + \\cos 2\\beta) + 2}$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the core principle for a fixed $\\theta$. For a given deflection angle, the relationship shows that as $M_1$ increases, the corresponding weak-shock solution for $\\beta$ decreases. This is a key, well-known trend visible on any $\\theta-\\beta-M$ chart.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the geometric change. The shock wave is a straight line attached to the leading edge. The shock angle $\\beta$ is measured from the upstream flow direction (or the body's surface, depending on convention). A decrease in $\\beta$ means the shock becomes more aligned with the flow direction. In the frame of the body, the shock wave appears to move closer to the body surface (or the surface's extension).",
          "Step 5: Eliminate incorrect options. (B) is the opposite effect. (C) is incorrect because detachment occurs when $\\theta$ exceeds $\\theta_{max}$ for a given $M_1$, or when $M_1$ is *decreased* below the detachment Mach number for a given $\\theta$. Increasing $M_1$ for an already attached shock makes it stay attached. (D) is incorrect because a normal shock corresponds to $\\beta = 90^\\circ$, which occurs at very low supersonic Mach numbers for a given $\\theta$; increasing $M_1$ makes $\\beta$ decrease further from 90$^\\circ$."
