        "reasoning": "The behavior of an attached oblique shock wave is governed by the `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` relationship, where $\\theta$ is the flow deflection angle (determined by the wedge angle, which is fixed in this problem), $\\beta$ is the shock wave angle, and $M_{\\infty}$ is the upstream Mach number. For a fixed flow deflection angle $\\theta$, an increase in the free stream Mach number $M_{\\infty}$ causes the shock wave angle $\\beta$ to decrease. A smaller shock angle $\\beta$ means the shock wave is less inclined with respect to the incoming flow direction, making it 'flatter' and thus moving it closer to the body surface. This is a fundamental characteristic of oblique shocks, often visualized using `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` diagrams. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1 and Chunk 6) explicitly supports this: 'For a fixed deflection angle, increasing $M_1$ causes the shock angle $\\beta$ to decrease' (Chunk 1) and 'The higher the Mach number, the more the flow is compressed and the closer the shock wave adheres to the body' (Chunk 6)."

          "Step 1: Understand the setup. The question describes a 2-D body (a wedge, as shown in the image) in supersonic flow with an attached oblique shock. The body's geometry dictates a fixed flow deflection angle, $\\theta$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental relationship for oblique shocks, known as the `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` relation. This equation (or its graphical representation, the `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` diagram) links the upstream Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$), the shock wave angle ($\\beta$), and the flow deflection angle ($\\theta$).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of increasing $M_{\\infty}$ for a constant $\\theta$. According to the `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` relationship, for a fixed deflection angle $\\theta$, an increase in the upstream Mach number $M_{\\infty}$ results in a decrease in the shock wave angle $\\beta$.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the physical meaning of a decreasing shock angle $\\beta$. A smaller $\\beta$ means the shock wave becomes more aligned with the free stream direction (less steep). Geometrically, this implies that the shock wave moves closer to the surface of the body.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options. Option A, 'move closer to the body,' is consistent with the decrease in $\\beta$. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Moving away from the body would imply an increase in $\\beta$. Detachment typically occurs when $\\theta$ exceeds a maximum value for a given $M_{\\infty}$, or when $M_{\\infty}$ decreases below a critical value. Becoming a normal shock ($\\beta = 90^{\\circ}$) is not the general behavior for an oblique shock with increasing $M_{\\infty}$ at a fixed $\\theta > 0$."
