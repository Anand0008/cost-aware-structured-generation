From Anderson and standard gas-dynamics results, for a fixed \\(\\theta\\), as the upstream Mach number \\(M_\\infty\\) increases, the weak-solution shock angle \\(\\beta\\) decreases and approaches the Mach angle. A smaller \\(\\beta\\) means the shock becomes more inclined to the flow direction and therefore lies closer to the body surface. Geometrically, the distance between the body and the shock (standoff distance) reduces, so the shock appears to move closer to the body. It does not detach (that happens when \\(M_\\infty\\) is too low for the given \\(\\theta\\), or \\(\\theta>\\theta_{\\max}\\)), and it does not become a normal shock; in fact, increasing Mach makes it more oblique, not more normal.
