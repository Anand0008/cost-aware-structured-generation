This implies the function has a minimum value at its vertex, not a maximum value. Therefore, options A and B, which claim a maximum value, are incorrect.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the first derivative of the function, $f'(x)$. The derivative helps determine the slope of the tangent to the curve, which indicates whether the function is increasing or decreasing. $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 5x + 6) = 2x - 5$.",
          "Step 4: Find the critical point(s) by setting the first derivative to zero. This point indicates where the function's slope is zero, which is typically a local maximum or minimum. $2x - 5 = 0 \\implies 2x = 5 \\implies x = 2.5$. This is the x-coordinate of the vertex.",

So, the function is decreasing for $x < 2.5$.\n    - For $x > 2.5$, choose a test value, e.g., $x=3$. $f'(3) = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1 > 0$. So, the function is increasing for $x > 2.5$.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the remaining options based on the analysis. Option C states the function is increasing on $(2.0, 2.5)$. Since this interval is to the left of $x=2.5$, the function is decreasing, making C incorrect. Option D states the function is increasing on $(2.5, 3.0)$. Since this interval is to the right of $x=2.5$, the function is increasing, making D correct."
