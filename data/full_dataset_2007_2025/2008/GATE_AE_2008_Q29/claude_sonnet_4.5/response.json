To find its maximum/minimum, we need to find the critical points by setting the derivative $f'(x) = 2x - 5$ equal to zero and solving for $x$. \n\nThe critical point is $x = 5/2 = 2.5$. To determine if this is a maximum or minimum, we can check the sign of the second derivative $f''(x) = 2$, which is positive. This means the function has a minimum at $x = 2.5$.\n\nTherefore, the function is increasing on the interval $(2.5, \\infty)$, which includes the interval $(2.5, 3.0)$. So, the correct answer is option D."
