On the unit circle (x² + y² = 1), u = y/2, v = -x/2. Circulation Γ = ∮(u dx + v dy) = (1/2)∮(y dx - x dy). Parametrizing the unit circle as x = cos θ, y = sin θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π gives y dx - x dy = -dθ. Then Γ = (1/2)∫₀²π (-dθ) = -π, so the absolute value is π. Alternatively, recognizing ψ = (Γ/(2π)) ln(r) for a potential vortex gives Γ/(2π) = 1/2, so Γ = π. Both methods yield answer D."
