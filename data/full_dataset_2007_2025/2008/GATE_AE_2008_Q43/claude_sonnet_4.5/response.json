To calculate the circulation, we need to evaluate the line integral ∮(x dy - y dx) around the unit circle.\n\nUsing the given stream function, we can find the velocity components:\nu = ∂ψ/∂y = (1/2) * (1/√(x² + y²)) * (x/√(x² + y²)) = x/(x² + y²)\nv = -∂ψ/∂x = -(1/2) * (1/√(x² + y²)) * (y/√(x² + y²)) = -y/(x² + y²)\n\nSubstituting these into the line integral, we get:\n∮(x dy - y dx) = ∮(x * (-y/(x² + y²)) dx - y * (x/(x² + y²)) dy)\n= ∮(-(xy)/(x² + y²) dx - (xy)/(x² + y²) dy)\n= ∮(-(xy)/(x² + y²) d(x² + y²)/2)\n= -∮(xy d(x² + y²))/2(x² + y²)\n\nParameterizing the unit circle as x = cos(t), y = sin(t), we get:\n∮(x dy - y dx) = -∮(cos(t) sin(t) d(cos²(t) + sin²(t)))/2(cos²(t) + sin²(t))\n= -∮(sin(2t) dt)/2\n= -π\n\nTaking the absolute value, the final result is π, which matches the correct answer in the answer key."
