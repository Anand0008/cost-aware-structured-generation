Compute derivatives: \\n\\n\\(\\psi = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\ln r = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\ln (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} = \\tfrac{1}{4} \\ln (x^2 + y^2)\\).\\n\\nThus, \\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2x}{x^2 + y^2} = \\frac{x}{2(x^2 + y^2)}\\),\\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2y}{x^2 + y^2} = \\frac{y}{2(x^2 + y^2)}\\).\\nSo \\(u = \\partial \\psi / \\partial y = \\dfrac{y}{2(x^2 + y^2)}\\), \\(v = -\\partial \\psi / \\partial x = -\\dfrac{x}{2(x^2 + y^2)}\\).\\n\\nOn the unit circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), this simplifies to \\(u = y/2\\), \\(v = -x/2\\).
