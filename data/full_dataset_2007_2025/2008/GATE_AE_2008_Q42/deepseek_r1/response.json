        "reasoning": "At a low angle of attack, aerodynamic behavior is approximately linear. Standard flight dynamics stability derivatives show that yawing motion (yaw rate, r) primarily generates a yawing moment ($N_r$, yaw damping) and also induces a rolling moment ($L_r$, due to differential lift on the wings). This cross-coupling is a fundamental lateral-directional coupling. Rolling motion primarily generates rolling moment ($L_p$) and a small yawing moment ($N_p$), but not a pitching moment. Pitching motion primarily generates pitching moment ($M_q$), with negligible lateral-directional coupling at low angle of attack. Thus, only option C correctly describes a known cross-coupling effect."
