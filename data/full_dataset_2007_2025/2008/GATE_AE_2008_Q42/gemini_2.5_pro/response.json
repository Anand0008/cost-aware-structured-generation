        "reasoning": "The question asks about the moments generated by specific aircraft motions. This relates to aerodynamic stability derivatives, which describe how changes in angular rates (rolling rate P, pitching rate Q, yawing rate R) or angles (angle of attack $\\alpha$, sideslip $\\beta$) generate aerodynamic moments (Rolling moment L, Pitching moment M, Yawing moment N).\n\n1.  **Yawing motion (rate R)**: According to the principles of flight mechanics, a yawing motion (rotation about the Z-axis) generates both a yawing moment and a rolling moment. The yawing moment due to yaw rate ($N_R$) is a damping moment that opposes the yawing motion. The rolling moment due to yaw rate ($L_R$) arises because, during a yaw, the wing advancing into the turn experiences higher airspeed and thus more lift/drag, while the retreating wing experiences lower airspeed. This differential lift/drag creates a rolling moment. This is explicitly supported by CHUNK 6, which states: \"The yaw rate, in turn, can generate additional rolling moments (`L_R`) and yawing moments (`N_R`)\".\n\n2.  **Rolling motion (rate P)**: Rolling motion primarily generates a rolling moment ($L_P$, roll damping). It can also generate a yawing moment ($N_P$, adverse yaw), but generally does not directly generate a significant pitching moment ($M_P$) for a symmetric aircraft at low angle of attack.\n\n3.  **Pitching motion (rate Q)**: Pitching motion primarily generates a pitching moment ($M_Q$, pitch damping). It generally does not directly generate significant yawing ($N_Q$) or rolling ($L_Q$) moments for a symmetric aircraft at low angle of attack.\n\nGiven this, option C is the only statement that accurately describes a common and significant aerodynamic coupling effect for an aircraft flying at a low angle of attack."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the question's focus on how aircraft rotational motions (rolling, pitching, yawing) generate aerodynamic moments (rolling, pitching, yawing moments). This involves understanding aerodynamic coupling and stability derivatives.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definitions of the three primary rotational motions and their corresponding body-fixed axes: Rolling (about X-axis), Pitching (about Y-axis), and Yawing (about Z-axis). Also, recall the moments associated with these axes: Rolling Moment (L), Pitching Moment (M), and Yawing Moment (N). (Refer to CHUNKS 2, 3, 4, 5).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effects of Yawing motion (rate R). A yaw rate generates a yawing moment ($N_R \\cdot R$) which is typically a damping moment. More importantly, it also generates a rolling moment ($L_R \\cdot R$). This is due to the differential velocity experienced by the wings during a yaw, leading to differential lift and drag, and thus a rolling moment. (Refer to CHUNK 6).",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C: \"Yawing motion generates yawing moment and rolling moment.\" Based on Step 3, this statement is true due to the existence of $N_R$ (yaw damping) and $L_R$ (rolling moment due to yaw rate) derivatives.",
          "Step 5: Briefly evaluate other options for completeness. Rolling motion (rate P) primarily generates a rolling moment ($L_P$). Pitching motion (rate Q) primarily generates a pitching moment ($M_Q$). Cross-coupling between longitudinal and lateral-directional motions (e.g., pitching generating yawing/rolling moments, or rolling/yawing generating pitching moments) is generally negligible for a symmetric aircraft at low angle of attack, unless significant inertial coupling (due to $I_{xz}$) is present, which is not the primary focus of this question's phrasing. Therefore, options A, B, and D are generally false in the context of primary aerodynamic effects at low angle of attack."
