At low angles of attack, the aerodynamic coupling between the different aircraft motions is primarily through the lateral-directional dynamics. Specifically, a yawing motion will generate a yawing moment (about the vertical Z-axis) as well as a rolling moment (about the longitudinal X-axis) due to the sideslip angle induced by the yaw. This is described by the stability derivatives `C_N_beta` and `C_L_beta`. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
