        "reasoning": "The standard convention for defining aircraft Euler angles (roll $\\phi$, pitch $\\theta$, and yaw $\\psi$) involves a specific sequence of three successive rotations to transform the inertial (Earth-fixed) frame to the aircraft body frame. This sequence is commonly known as the Z-Y-X sequence, or Yaw-Pitch-Roll. The rotations are performed as follows:\n1.  **First Rotation (Yaw, $\\psi$):** A rotation about the initial (inertial) Z-axis. This sets the heading of the aircraft.\n2.  **Second Rotation (Pitch, $\\theta$):** A rotation about the *intermediate* Y-axis (the Y-axis of the frame after the first rotation). This sets the nose-up or nose-down attitude.\n3.  **Third Rotation (Roll, $\\phi$):** A rotation about the *final* body X-axis (the X-axis of the frame after the second rotation). This sets the bank angle.\n\nOption A correctly describes this standard sequence: \"first $\\psi$ about z axis, second $\\theta$ about y axis, third $\\phi$ about x axis\". The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6) consistently confirms this Z-Y-X sequence as the standard for aircraft Euler angles, emphasizing the crucial order and the axes of rotation (initial Z, intermediate Y, final X)."
