For a general transport aircraft, 100 ft/min is a commonly accepted value, especially in the context of older GATE questions or general definitions where a specific type (propeller/jet) isn't specified, implying the lower, more conservative value. \\n\\nTo verify option D, we convert 100 ft/min to m/s:\\n$1 \\text{ ft} = 0.3048 \\text{ m}$\\n$1 \\text{ min} = 60 \\text{ s}$\\nRate of Climb $= 100 \\frac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{min}} = 100 \\times \\frac{0.3048 \\text{ m}}{60 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{30.48}{60} \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}} = 0.508 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}$.\\n\\nTherefore, option D, which states 'at which its maximum rate of climb is 0.508 m/s', is the correct definition for the service ceiling."
