        "reasoning": "The question pertains to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model, specifically the stratosphere. According to the ISA model:\n\n1.  **Temperature in the Stratosphere:** The stratosphere is typically divided into sub-layers. The lower stratosphere (from the tropopause at approximately 11 km or 36,000 ft up to about 20 km or 65,000 ft) is characterized by an *isothermal* region where the temperature remains constant. Above this, in the middle stratosphere (20 km to 32 km), temperature increases with altitude due to ozone absorption. When 'stratosphere' is mentioned in a general context like this question, it often refers to the initial, isothermal part. Therefore, 'Temperature remains constant' is a correct characteristic for a significant portion of the stratosphere.\n    *   (RAG Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5 support constant temperature in the lower stratosphere).\n\n2.  **Pressure and Density:** Throughout the entire atmosphere, including the stratosphere, both pressure and density *decrease exponentially* with increasing altitude. This is because there is less air mass above to exert weight.\n    *   (RAG Chunks 1, 5 support exponential decrease of pressure and density).\n\n3.  **Dynamic Viscosity:** Dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$) for gases is primarily a function of absolute temperature. For air, it generally increases with temperature. If temperature remains constant (as in the lower stratosphere), dynamic viscosity also remains constant. If temperature increases (as in the middle stratosphere), dynamic viscosity increases.\n\n4.  **Speed of Sound:** The speed of sound ($a$) is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R_s T}$). Therefore, if temperature remains constant, the speed of sound also remains constant. If temperature increases, the speed of sound increases.\n    *   (RAG Chunks 2, 3 provide the formula and explain the dependence on temperature).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. Temperature increases and dynamic viscosity decreases.** Temperature increases in the middle stratosphere, but if temperature increases, dynamic viscosity *increases*, not decreases. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **B. Temperature remains constant and pressure increases.** Temperature remains constant in the lower stratosphere, but pressure *decreases* with altitude, it does not increase. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **C. Temperature decreases and sound speed decreases.** Temperature does not decrease in the stratosphere (it's constant or increases). Consequently, sound speed also does not decrease. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **D. Temperature remains constant and density decreases.** This statement is TRUE for the lower stratosphere. Temperature remains constant, and density always decreases with increasing altitude. This aligns perfectly with the ISA model for the lower stratosphere."

          "Step 1: Understand the question. The question asks about the changes in atmospheric properties as altitude increases specifically in the 'stratosphere' of the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).",
          "Step 2: Recall the characteristics of the ISA model, particularly the stratosphere. The ISA defines the atmosphere in layers with specific temperature profiles. The troposphere (0-11 km) has a decreasing temperature. The lower stratosphere (11-20 km) is an isothermal region where temperature remains constant. The middle stratosphere (20-32 km) sees temperature increasing, and the upper stratosphere (32-47 km) is again isothermal.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the behavior of temperature. In the lower stratosphere, temperature remains constant. This is a key feature of the ISA model often implied when 'stratosphere' is generally referred to.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the behavior of pressure and density. For the entire atmosphere, including the stratosphere, both pressure and density decrease exponentially with increasing altitude due to the decreasing weight of the air column above.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the behavior of dynamic viscosity. Dynamic viscosity of a gas is primarily dependent on its absolute temperature. If temperature is constant (lower stratosphere), dynamic viscosity is also constant. If temperature increases (middle stratosphere), dynamic viscosity increases.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the behavior of the speed of sound. The speed of sound ($a$) is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R_s T}$). Therefore, if temperature is constant, the speed of sound is constant. If temperature increases, the speed of sound increases.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate each option based on these atmospheric properties in the stratosphere (primarily focusing on the lower, isothermal region as it's the first part and most commonly referenced for 'constant temperature').\n    *   A: Temperature increases (true for middle stratosphere) but dynamic viscosity decreases (false, it would increase). Incorrect.\n    *   B: Temperature remains constant (true for lower stratosphere) but pressure increases (false, pressure always decreases). Incorrect.\n    *   C: Temperature decreases (false, it's constant or increases) and sound speed decreases (false). Incorrect.\n    *   D: Temperature remains constant (true for lower stratosphere) and density decreases (true for all altitudes). Correct."
