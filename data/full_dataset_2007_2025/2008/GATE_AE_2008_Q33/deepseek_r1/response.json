        "reasoning": "In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the stratosphere is defined with specific layers. For the lower stratosphere (approximately 11 km to 20 km), the temperature remains constant (isothermal). As altitude increases in this region, pressure and density continue to decrease due to the hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law. Dynamic viscosity for air is primarily a function of temperature; since temperature is constant, viscosity remains constant. Sound speed depends on temperature ($a = \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma R T}$), so if temperature is constant, sound speed is constant. Option D states 'Temperature remains constant and density decreases,' which matches ISA behavior. Option A is false because temperature does not increase in the lower stratosphere (it is constant) and viscosity does not decrease (it is constant). Option B is false because pressure does not increase; it decreases. Option C is false because temperature does not decrease; it is constant, and thus sound speed is constant, not decreasing."
