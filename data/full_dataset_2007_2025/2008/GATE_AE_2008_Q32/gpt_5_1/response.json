Changing elevator deflection \\\\delta_e adds a nearly constant pitching moment across angle of attack, shifting the C_m-\\\\alpha line vertically (changing intercept C_{m0}) but not its slope C_{m_\\\\alpha}. Hence different elevator settings at the same CG produce parallel C_m-\\\\alpha lines. Conversely, moving the CG changes the static stability derivative C_{m_\\\\alpha} (slope) but leaves the basic zero-lift moment about aerodynamic center unchanged, so lines for different CGs at same elevator tend to intersect at a common C_m-axis intercept. In the figure, lines P and Q are parallel, so they correspond to the same CG but different elevator deflections. Lines Q and R share the same intercept on C_m axis, so they correspond to same elevator deflection but different CG locations. Therefore the only correct statement is: Lines P and Q correspond to the same centre of gravity location (Option A)."

          "Step 3: Changing CG location changes the moment arm of lift relative to CG, altering C_{m_\\\\alpha} (slope).

These directly supported the reasoning that elevator changes intercept while CG changes slope. No major gaps for this conceptual question."
