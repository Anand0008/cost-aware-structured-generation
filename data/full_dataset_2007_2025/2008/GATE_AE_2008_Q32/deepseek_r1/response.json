        "reasoning": "The fundamental principle is: (1) The slope of the Cm vs. α curve (or Cm vs. CL) represents the static longitudinal stability and depends primarily on the center of gravity (CG) location. A more forward CG gives a more negative slope (more stable). (2) Elevator deflection (δe) shifts the curve vertically, changing the intercept (Cm0) but not the slope. Therefore, parallel lines (same slope) imply the same CG location. Lines P and Q are parallel, so they correspond to the same CG location (option A). Lines Q and R share the same intercept, which can result from different combinations of CG and elevator deflection, so options B, C, and D cannot be conclusively true."

          "Step 1: Understand the graph. It plots pitching moment coefficient (Cm) vs. angle of attack (α) for three conditions (lines P, Q, R). Each line corresponds to a specific combination of elevator deflection (δe) and CG location.",
          "Step 2: Recall the effect of elevator deflection. From stability theory, deflecting the elevator adds a constant pitching moment increment, shifting the entire Cm vs. α curve vertically without changing its slope. Different δe produce parallel lines.",
          "Step 3: Recall the effect of CG location. Moving the CG changes the aircraft's static longitudinal stability. A forward CG increases the negative slope (more stable), an aft CG reduces the negative slope (less stable). Thus, different CG locations yield lines with different slopes.",
          "Step 4: Analyze given conditions. Lines P and Q are parallel, meaning they have identical slopes. This indicates they have the same CG location (since slope depends on CG). Their vertical shift (different intercepts) is due to different elevator deflections.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the second condition. Lines Q and R have the same intercept on the Cm axis. The intercept is Cm at α=0, which depends on both the inherent airframe moment (Cm0) and the elevator deflection (δe). The same intercept can be achieved with different combinations of CG (affecting Cm0) and δe, so Q and R need not share the same CG or δe.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate options. Option A states P and Q same CG → true due to same slope. Option B states Q and R same CG → not necessarily true (same intercept doesn't imply same CG). Option C states P and Q same δe → false (they are parallel but shifted, so δe differs). Option D states P and R same CG → no information given about their slopes."
