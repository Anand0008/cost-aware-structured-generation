This is Kepler's Second Law, derived from the conservation of angular momentum. Option A is incorrect because kinetic energy varies (speed changes with orbital position). Option B is incorrect: speed (v) times radial distance (r) is not constant; the conserved quantity related to angular momentum is $r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$ or the magnitude of $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}$. Option C is incorrect because the 'center of the orbit' is ambiguous and not the center of force; Kepler's law specifically refers to the radial vector from the center of attraction (focus)."

The product $v \\cdot r$ includes the radial velocity component $\\dot{r}$, which is not constant, so $v \\cdot r$ is not constant.",
