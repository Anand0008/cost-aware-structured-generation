This means that the areal velocity, defined as the rate of change of the area swept out by the radius vector, is constant for a satellite in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. The other options, such as kinetic energy (A) and the product of speed and radial distance (B), do not remain constant for an elliptical orbit."
