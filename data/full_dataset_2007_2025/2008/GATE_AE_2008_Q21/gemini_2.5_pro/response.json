This means the rate at which the area is swept by the radial vector from the center of attraction (Earth) is constant. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum in a central force field. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because: A) Kinetic energy varies in an elliptical orbit (faster at periapsis, slower at apoapsis). B) The product of speed and radial distance (`v*r`) is not a conserved quantity; angular momentum (`m*r*v_tangential`) is conserved, but `v` is the total speed, not just tangential. C) Kepler's Second Law refers to the radial vector from the center of attraction (Earth, which is at a focus), not the geometric center of the orbit."

The constancy of the rate of area swept is a direct consequence of the conservation of specific angular momentum (`h = r^2 * \\dot{\\theta}`) in a central force field. The rate of area swept is `dA/dt = (1/2) * r^2 * \\dot{\\theta} = (1/2)h`, which is constant.",

The product of speed and radial distance (Option B) is not a fundamental conserved quantity. The 'center of the orbit' (Option C) is distinct from the 'center of the Earth' (the focus of the ellipse), making this option incorrect as Kepler's law applies to the focus.
