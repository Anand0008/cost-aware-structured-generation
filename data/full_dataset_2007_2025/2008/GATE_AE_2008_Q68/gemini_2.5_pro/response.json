        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the logarithmic decrement ($\\delta$) given the quality factor (Q) of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with viscous damping. The key is to relate Q to the damping ratio ($\\zeta$), and then relate $\\zeta$ to $\\delta$. \\n\\n1.  **Relationship between Quality Factor (Q) and Damping Ratio ($\\zeta$):**\\n    For an SDOF system, the quality factor Q is inversely related to the damping ratio $\\zeta$ by the formula: \\n    `Q = 1 / (2 * \\zeta)`\\n    Given `Q = 10`, we can find $\\zeta$: \\n    `10 = 1 / (2 * \\zeta)`\\n    `\\zeta = 1 / (2 * 10) = 1 / 20 = 0.05`\\n\\n2.  **Relationship between Logarithmic Decrement ($\\delta$) and Damping Ratio ($\\zeta$):**\\n    The logarithmic decrement $\\delta$ is related to the damping ratio $\\zeta$ by the formula: \\n    `\\delta = (2 * \\pi * \\zeta) / \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}`\\n    Substitute the calculated value of $\\zeta = 0.05$: \\n    `\\delta = (2 * \\pi * 0.05) / \\sqrt{1 - (0.05)^2}`\\n    `\\delta = (0.1 * \\pi) / \\sqrt{1 - 0.0025}`\\n    `\\delta = (0.1 * \\pi) / \\sqrt{0.9975}`\\n\\n3.  **Approximation for Small Damping:**\\n    Since $\\zeta = 0.05$ is a small value (much less than 1), the term $\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$ is approximately equal to 1. \\n    `\\sqrt{1 - (0.05)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0025} = \\sqrt{0.9975} \\approx 0.9987 \\approx 1`\\n    Therefore, the logarithmic decrement can be approximated as: \\n    `\\delta \\approx 2 * \\pi * \\zeta`\\n    `\\delta \\approx 2 * \\pi * 0.05`\\n    `\\delta \\approx 0.1 * \\pi`\\n    `\\delta \\approx \\pi / 10`\\n\\n    Using the full formula, `\\delta = (0.1 * \\pi) / 0.9987 \\approx 0.10013 \\pi`, which is very close to `0.1 \\pi`. For GATE problems, this approximation is generally accepted for small damping ratios.\\n\\nThus, the logarithmic decrement is `\\pi / 10`, which corresponds to option C."

However, the crucial relationship between the Quality Factor (Q) and the damping ratio (zeta) was not explicitly present in the provided RAG context. This required supplementation from the model's internal knowledge. The RAG was moderately helpful for the second part of the problem but missed a key initial step."
