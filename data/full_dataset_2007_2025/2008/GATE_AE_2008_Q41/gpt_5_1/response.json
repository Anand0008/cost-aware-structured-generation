        "reasoning": "Lowering trim speed means increasing lift coefficient at trim, i.e., increasing angle of attack. For a conventional elevator, trailing-edge-up deflection (negative \\(\\delta_e\\)) produces a nose-up moment. The question states that to go to a *lower* trim speed, the elevator must move trailing edge up. That means: as trim speed decreases (\\(V_{trim}\\downarrow\\)), \\(C_{L,trim}\\uparrow\\), and the required elevator deflection becomes more negative (more TE-up). So \\(d\\delta_e/dC_{L,trim} < 0\\). From longitudinal trim theory (stick-fixed): \\(\\frac{d\\delta_e}{dC_{L,trim}} = -\\frac{dC_m/dC_L}{C_{m_{\\delta_e}}}\\). For a conventional elevator, \\(C_{m_{\\delta_e}}<0\\). Thus, if \\(d\\delta_e/dC_{L,trim}<0\\), the numerator \\(dC_m/dC_L\\) must be positive. A positive \\(dC_m/dC_L\\) means that as lift (or angle of attack) increases, the pitching moment becomes more nose-up, which is statically *unstable*. Therefore the aircraft is statically unstable in stick-fixed sense. This matches option A."

          "Step 1: Interpret the physical situation. Lower trim speed means the aircraft must fly at higher angle of attack to produce the same weight-supporting lift, so the trim lift coefficient C_L,trim increases.",
          "Step 2: Note the control response given: to achieve this new (lower) trim speed, the elevator trailing edge must move upwards. With the usual sign convention, trailing-edge-up elevator is negative delta_e.",
          "Step 3: Therefore, as C_L,trim increases, the required delta_e becomes more negative. This implies the slope d(delta_e)/d(C_L,trim) is negative.",
          "Step 4: Use the standard trim relation for stick-fixed longitudinal stability: d(delta_e)/d(C_L,trim) = - (dC_m/dC_L) / C_{m_{delta_e}}.",
          "Step 5: For a conventional elevator, C_{m_{delta_e}} < 0 (trailing-edge-down elevator gives nose-down moment). Given d(delta_e)/d(C_L,trim) < 0 and C_{m_{delta_e}} < 0, the only way the product can be negative is if dC_m/dC_L > 0.",
          "Step 6: A positive dC_m/dC_L means that when lift (or angle of attack) increases, the pitching moment becomes more nose-up, so disturbances grow. This is the definition of static longitudinal instability. Hence, the aircraft is statically unstable (stick-fixed)."
