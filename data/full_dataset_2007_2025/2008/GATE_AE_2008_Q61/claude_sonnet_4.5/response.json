When the initial propellant temperature increases, the burn rate of the solid propellant increases, leading to a higher mass flow rate and thus higher thrust. However, the burn time decreases due to the faster burn rate. This is because the total impulse (the integral of thrust over time) remains approximately constant, so a higher thrust is delivered over a shorter duration."
