        "reasoning": "According to the official GATE 2008 answer key, the correct answer is D (thrust increases but burn time remains same). However, based on standard propulsion theory and the retrieved knowledge (RAG context), a positive initial temperature sensitivity leads to an increased burn rate. This increases mass flow rate ($\\dot{m} = \\rho_p A_b r$), thus increasing thrust ($F = \\dot{m} I_{sp} g_0$ or $F = P_c A_t C_F$). With fixed propellant mass, a higher burn rate decreases the burn time ($t_b \\approx \\text{propellant mass} / \\dot{m}$). Therefore, the expected physical outcome is thrust increases and burn time decreases (Option A). The official answer D appears to contradict this established principle. This discrepancy should be noted for student awareness."

          "Step 1: Understand the given condition. The 'initial temperature sensitivity of burn rate' is positive. This means the coefficient $s$ or $\\pi_r$ is positive, where $s = \\frac{d(\\ln r)}{dT_i}$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the effect of initial temperature $T_i$ on burn rate $r$. For positive sensitivity, if $T_i$ increases, $r$ increases. The relationship is often $r(T_i) = r_0 \\exp(s (T_i - T_0))$ or $r_2 = r_1 \\exp(\\pi_r (T_2 - T_1))$.",
          "Step 3: Connect burn rate to mass flow rate. The mass flow rate of generated gas is $\\dot{m} = \\rho_p A_b r$, where $\\rho_p$ is propellant density and $A_b$ is burning area (assumed constant for this conceptual question). An increase in $r$ directly increases $\\dot{m}$.",
          "Step 4: Determine thrust change. Thrust $F$ is proportional to mass flow rate for a given specific impulse ($F = \\dot{m} I_{sp} g_0$). Also, from the thrust equation $F = P_c A_t C_F$, an increase in burn rate typically increases chamber pressure $P_c$, thus increasing $F$. Therefore, thrust increases.",
          "Step 5: Determine burn time change. Burn time $t_b$ is approximately the total propellant mass $m_p$ divided by the average mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ ($t_b \\approx m_p / \\dot{m}$). Since $\\dot{m}$ increases and $m_p$ is fixed, $t_b$ decreases.",
          "Step 6: Conclusion: Increased $T_i$ (with positive sensitivity) leads to increased thrust and decreased burn time. This corresponds to Option A."
