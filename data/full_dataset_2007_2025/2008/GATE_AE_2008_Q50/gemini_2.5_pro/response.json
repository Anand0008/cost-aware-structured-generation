        "reasoning": "The correct answer is A. This is directly stated by the Kutta condition, a fundamental principle in potential flow theory for lifting airfoils. The Kutta condition mandates that the flow must leave the trailing edge of an airfoil smoothly. For a sharp trailing edge, this implies that the velocities on the upper and lower surfaces must be equal at the trailing edge. Since the vortex sheet strength $\\gamma$ is defined as the difference in tangential velocities across the sheet ($\\gamma = u_1 - u_2$), a smooth flow condition at the trailing edge requires this difference to be zero, i.e., $\\gamma(\\text{TE}) = 0$. This condition ensures a unique and physically realistic solution for the circulation and thus the lift generated by the airfoil."

Since $\\gamma$ represents the difference in tangential velocities ($u_1 - u_2$), and the Kutta condition requires $u_1 = u_2$ at the trailing edge, it follows that the vortex sheet strength at the trailing edge must be zero ($\\gamma(\\text{TE}) = 0$).",
