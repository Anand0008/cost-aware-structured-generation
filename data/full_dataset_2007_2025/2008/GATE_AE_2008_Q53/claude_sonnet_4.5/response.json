Based on the information provided in the RAG context, a split flap (option A) is the correct answer.\n\nThe RAG explains that leading-edge devices like slats and Krueger flaps primarily delay flow separation and extend the lift curve to higher angles of attack, thereby increasing the maximum lift coefficient (CL_max) and stall angle. In contrast, trailing-edge flaps like Fowler and plain flaps primarily increase camber and wing area, which also increases CL_max but does not directly impact the stall angle as significantly as leading-edge devices.\n\nTherefore, a split flap, which is a type of leading-edge flap, would result in a higher stalling angle compared to the other options presented."
