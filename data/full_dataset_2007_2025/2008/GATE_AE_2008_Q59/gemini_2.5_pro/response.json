        "reasoning": "The problem specifies a convergent nozzle with choked flow at the exit. This implies that the flow Mach number at the nozzle exit ($M_e$) is 1. For isentropic flow, the ratio of static pressure at the exit ($P_e$) to the stagnation pressure in the chamber ($P_c$) when $M_e=1$ (i.e., the critical pressure ratio) is given by:\n$$\\frac{P_e}{P_c} = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$$\nThe ideal jet exit velocity ($V_e$) for isentropic expansion from chamber conditions ($P_c, T_c$) to exit pressure ($P_e$) is:\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{P_e}{P_c}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right]}$$\nSubstitute the critical pressure ratio into the velocity equation:\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\left(\\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right]}$$\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right]}$$\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[\\frac{\\gamma+1 - 2}{\\gamma+1}\\right]}$$\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1}\\right]}$$\n$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma+1}}$$\nThe specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is related to the effective exhaust velocity ($V_e$) by $I_{sp} = \\frac{V_e}{g_0}$, where $g_0$ is the standard acceleration due to gravity. Since the options do not include $g_0$ and are in units of velocity, the question is effectively asking for the effective exhaust velocity, $V_e$. Thus, option D is the correct answer. The condition \"nozzle exhaust static pressure is equal to ambient static pressure\" ($P_e = P_a$) implies that the nozzle is perfectly expanded, which is consistent with the exit pressure being the critical pressure if $P_a = P^*$. This means there is no pressure thrust term."

          "Step 1: Identify the given conditions. The problem states a 'convergent nozzle' and 'flow at the exit of this nozzle is choked'. This is a critical piece of information, implying that the flow Mach number at the nozzle exit ($M_e$) is 1.",
          "Step 2: Recall the isentropic flow relation for the critical pressure ratio. For an ideal gas undergoing isentropic flow, when the Mach number is 1 (choked condition), the ratio of static pressure at the throat (which is the exit for a choked convergent nozzle) to the stagnation pressure in the chamber ($P_c$) is given by: $\\frac{P_e}{P_c} = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$.",
          "Step 3: Write down the general formula for the ideal jet exit velocity ($V_e$). This formula describes the velocity achieved by isentropic expansion from chamber stagnation conditions ($P_c, T_c$) to the nozzle exit static pressure ($P_e$): $V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{P_e}{P_c}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right]}$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the critical pressure ratio from Step 2 into the ideal jet exit velocity formula from Step 3. This replaces the $\\left(\\frac{P_e}{P_c}\\right)$ term with the expression for choked flow.",
          "Step 5: Simplify the resulting algebraic expression. The terms involving exponents will cancel out, leading to a simpler expression inside the square root. Perform the subtraction of fractions to arrive at the final simplified formula for $V_e$.",
          "Step 6: Interpret the question's request for 'specific impulse'. While specific impulse is strictly $I_{sp} = V_e/g_0$, the options provided are in units of velocity and do not include $g_0$. Therefore, the question is effectively asking for the effective exhaust velocity, $V_e$."

The critical pressure ratio formula, while not explicitly stated in the RAG, is a fundamental isentropic flow relation that is a prerequisite for understanding choked flow, which was mentioned. The RAG was highly relevant and helpful for constructing the solution."
