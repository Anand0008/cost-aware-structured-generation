        "reasoning": "Specific impulse for a rocket with zero flight speed and exit pressure equal to ambient is simply the exhaust velocity divided by g0; since g0 is common to all options, we effectively compare exhaust velocities. For a convergent-only nozzle with choked exit, the exit Mach number is 1. Using isentropic relations with chamber stagnation temperature T_c and Mach 1 at the exit, the static exit temperature is T_e = T_c \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}. The ideal exhaust velocity is V_e = \\sqrt{2 c_p (T_c - T_e)} with c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}. Substituting T_e and simplifying gives V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma+1}}.
