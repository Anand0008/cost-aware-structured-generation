        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. An irrotational and inviscid flow can become rotational on passing through a curved shock wave. This is because the strength of a curved shock varies along its surface, leading to a non-uniform entropy increase across different streamlines. The resulting entropy gradient perpendicular to the streamlines generates vorticity in the flow field downstream of the curved shock, making the flow rotational. This is in contrast to a straight oblique shock, where the flow can remain irrotational if the upstream flow is uniform and irrotational. The key principle is that Crocco's theorem relates entropy gradients to the generation of vorticity in compressible, adiabatic flows."
