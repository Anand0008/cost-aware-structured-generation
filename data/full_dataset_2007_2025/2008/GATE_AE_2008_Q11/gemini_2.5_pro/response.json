        "reasoning": "The flow behind a curved shock wave is inherently rotational, even if the upstream flow is irrotational and inviscid. This is due to the varying strength of the curved shock along its surface. Different streamlines passing through different parts of the curved shock experience different increases in entropy. This non-uniform entropy distribution creates an entropy gradient perpendicular to the streamlines. According to Crocco's Theorem, for steady, inviscid, adiabatic flow, an entropy gradient perpendicular to streamlines directly generates vorticity, making the flow rotational. In contrast, a straight normal shock or a straight oblique shock, if uniform, can produce uniform flow properties behind them, and thus, if the upstream flow is irrotational, the downstream flow can remain irrotational (especially for weak oblique shocks). A Mach wave is an infinitesimally weak oblique shock and is considered an isentropic process, therefore it does not generate vorticity."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the concept of irrotational flow, which means the vorticity (local rotation of fluid elements) is zero, i.e., $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V} = 0$.",
          "Step 2: Recall Crocco's Theorem, which relates entropy gradients to vorticity. For steady, inviscid, adiabatic flow in the absence of body forces, it states: $T \\nabla s = \\mathbf{V} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) + \\nabla H_0$. For flow through a stationary shock, stagnation enthalpy $H_0$ is conserved along streamlines, so $\\nabla H_0$ in the direction normal to streamlines can be considered zero. The theorem simplifies to $T \\nabla s = \\mathbf{V} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V})$.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of different shock types on entropy. All shock waves cause an increase in entropy. However, the key factor for generating rotationality is a *gradient* in entropy across streamlines.",
          "Step 4: Consider a normal shock wave. While it increases entropy, if the upstream flow is uniform and irrotational, the flow behind a uniform normal shock will also be uniform and can remain irrotational, as there is no entropy gradient perpendicular to the streamlines.",
          "Step 5: Consider a straight oblique shock wave. Similar to a normal shock, if the upstream flow is uniform and irrotational, the flow behind a straight oblique shock can also be uniform and irrotational, especially for weak shocks, as the entropy increase is uniform across the streamlines.",
          "Step 6: Consider a Mach wave. A Mach wave is an infinitesimally weak oblique shock. It is an isentropic process, meaning there is no significant entropy increase, and thus no entropy gradient to generate vorticity.",
          "Step 7: Consider a curved shock wave (like a bow shock ahead of a blunt body). The strength of a curved shock varies along its surface. Streamlines passing through different portions of the curved shock experience different shock strengths and, consequently, different amounts of entropy increase. This creates a non-uniform entropy distribution, or an entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$) perpendicular to the streamlines behind the shock.",
          "Step 8: Apply Crocco's Theorem: Since a curved shock creates an entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$), the vorticity ($\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}$) must be non-zero. Therefore, the flow behind a curved shock becomes rotational."
