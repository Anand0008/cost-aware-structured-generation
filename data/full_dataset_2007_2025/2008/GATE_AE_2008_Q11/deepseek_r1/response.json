        "reasoning": "An initially irrotational and inviscid flow possesses zero vorticity ($\\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$). According to Crocco's theorem for steady, adiabatic, inviscid flow with no body forces: $T \\nabla s - \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla h_0$. For a shock wave, stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is conserved, so $\\nabla h_0 = 0$ in the direction normal to streamlines. The equation simplifies to $T \\nabla s = \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega}$. This shows that vorticity ($\\vec{\\omega}$) is generated if and only if there is an entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$) perpendicular to streamlines. A curved shock wave (like a detached bow shock) has varying strength along its surface, leading to non-uniform entropy increases for different streamlines, thereby creating an entropy gradient. In contrast, straight shocks (normal or oblique) with uniform upstream flow produce a constant entropy jump across the shock front ($\\nabla s = 0$), so the flow remains irrotational. A Mach wave is an isentropic compression wave ($\\Delta s \\approx 0$), so it cannot generate vorticity. Therefore, only a curved shock wave can make the flow rotational."

From fundamental fluid dynamics, vorticity can be generated by density gradients (baroclinic torque) or entropy gradients (via Crocco's theorem). For shocks, the key mechanism is the entropy gradient.",
          "Step 3: Recall Crocco's theorem for steady, adiabatic, inviscid flow: $T \\nabla s - \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla h_0$. Across a stationary shock, stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ is constant, so $\\nabla h_0 = 0$ in the cross-stream direction.",

          "Step 5: Analyze each shock type. A normal shock wave is straight and normal to a uniform flow; the entropy increase is constant across the shock front, so $\\nabla s = 0$ downstream, and flow remains irrotational.",
