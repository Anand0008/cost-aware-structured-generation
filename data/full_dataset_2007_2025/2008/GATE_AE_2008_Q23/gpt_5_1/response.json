The gradient is \\(\\nabla f = (x y^2 z^2, x^2 y z^2, x^2 y^2 z)\\), which is clearly nonzero except at the coordinate planes, so A is false. The divergence of the gradient (scalar Laplacian) is \\(\\nabla^2 f = 2 y^2 z^2 + 2 x^2 z^2 + 2 x^2 y^2\\), which is not identically zero, so B is false.

Chunks on gradient, curl, and the conservative nature of grad(phi) fields were particularly useful. No propulsion- or structures-specific material was needed."
