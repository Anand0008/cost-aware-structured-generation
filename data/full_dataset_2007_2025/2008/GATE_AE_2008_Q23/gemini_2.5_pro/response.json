This is not identically zero (e.g., it's non-zero for `x=y=z=1`). According to CHUNK 3, `grad f = 0` if and only if `f` is a constant, which `f(x,y,z)` is not. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\\n\\n**Option B: `div(grad f) = 0`**\\n`div(grad f)` is the Laplacian of `f`, denoted as `\\nabla^2 f`.\\n`\\nabla^2 f = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}`\\n`\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy^2z^2) = y^2z^2`\\n`\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2yz^2) = x^2z^2`\\n`\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2y^2z) = x^2y^2`\\nSo, `div(grad f) = y^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + x^2y^2`. This is not identically zero (e.g., it's non-zero for `x=y=z=1`). According to CHUNK 2, `div(grad f) = 0` is Laplace's equation, which `f(x,y,z)` does not satisfy. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\\n\\n**Option C: `curl(grad f) = 0`**\\n`curl(grad f) = \\nabla \\times (\\nabla f)`. This is a fundamental vector identity. As stated in CHUNK 1 and CHUNK 2, the curl of the gradient of any continuously differentiable scalar function `f` is always the zero vector. Since `f(x, y, z) = (1/2)x²y²z²` is continuously differentiable, this identity holds true.\\n`curl(grad f) = \\vec{0}`. Thus, Option C is correct.\\n\\n**Option D: `grad(div(grad f)) = 0`**\\nThis is `grad(\\nabla^2 f)`. From Option B, we found `\\nabla^2 f = y^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + x^2y^2`. Let `g = \\nabla^2 f`. We need to calculate `grad g`.\\n`grad g = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\hat{j} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}`\\n`\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + x^2y^2) = 2xz^2 + 2xy^2`\\n`\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + x^2y^2) = 2yz^2 + 2x^2y`\\n`\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(y^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + x^2y^2) = 2yz^2 + 2x^2z`\\nSo, `grad(div(grad f)) = (2xz^2 + 2xy^2)\\hat{i} + (2yz^2 + 2x^2y)\\hat{j} + (2yz^2 + 2x^2z)\\hat{k}`.
