        "reasoning": "The correct answer is B, which states that 'Wing dihedral increases roll stability while a low wing reduces roll stability'. This is consistent with the explanations provided in the retrieved knowledge:\n\n- Wing dihedral creates a restoring rolling moment during sideslip, which enhances lateral (roll) stability. This is because the wing facing the oncoming wind experiences a higher angle of attack, generating more lift and creating a rolling moment that opposes the sideslip.\n- A low-wing aircraft design generally reduces roll stability compared to a high-wing or mid-wing design, as the low wing position makes the aircraft more susceptible to rolling motions during sideslip.\n\nTherefore, the statements in option B accurately describe the effects of wing dihedral and wing position on an aircraft's roll stability."
