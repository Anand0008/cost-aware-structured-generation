        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge and standard aircraft stability theory confirm that wing dihedral increases lateral (roll) stability by generating a restoring rolling moment during sideslip (Cl_beta < 0). Conversely, a low-wing placement (center of mass above the wing) reduces inherent lateral stability compared to a high-wing configuration (which has a pendulum stabilizing effect). Therefore, dihedral increases stability, and a low wing decreases it. This aligns exactly with option B."

          "Step 2: Recall the effect of dihedral. When an aircraft sideslips, the windward wing experiences a higher effective angle of attack than the leeward wing due to dihedral geometry. This creates a differential lift, producing a rolling moment that rolls the aircraft back towards level flight. Thus, dihedral increases roll stability (makes Cl_beta negative).",
          "Step 3: Recall the effect of wing vertical placement. A high-wing aircraft has its center of gravity below the wing, creating a pendulum effect that stabilizes roll. A low-wing aircraft has its center of gravity above the wing, which reduces this pendulum effect and can be destabilizing. Therefore, a low wing, by itself, reduces roll stability compared to a mid or high wing.",
