        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge consistently states that wing dihedral enhances lateral static stability (roll stability). When an aircraft with dihedral experiences a sideslip, the wing into the wind experiences an increased effective angle of attack, generating more lift, while the other wing experiences a decreased angle of attack and less lift. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment that brings the aircraft back to a level attitude. This is quantified by a negative `C_L_beta` contribution from dihedral (Chunks 1, 2, 4). Regarding wing position, the RAG context (Chunks 3, 5) explicitly mentions that 'A low-wing design requires more dihedral than a mid-wing or high-wing design to achieve the same level of lateral stability.' This implies that a low-wing configuration inherently *reduces* lateral stability, thus necessitating more dihedral to compensate for this destabilizing effect. Therefore, wing dihedral increases roll stability, while a low wing reduces roll stability, making statement B true."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the concept of roll stability (also known as lateral stability). It refers to an aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after being disturbed in roll.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect of wing dihedral. Dihedral is the upward angle of the wings relative to the horizontal. When an aircraft with dihedral experiences a sideslip (e.g., slips to the right), the wing on the side of the slip (right wing) has a reduced effective angle of attack, and the opposite wing (left wing) has an increased effective angle of attack. This creates a differential lift, generating a restoring rolling moment that tends to roll the aircraft back to level. Thus, wing dihedral increases roll stability.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of a low-wing configuration. A low-wing configuration places the wing below the aircraft's center of gravity. When the aircraft rolls, the fuselage acts as a pendulum below the wing, which generally has a stabilizing effect. However, the RAG context (Chunks 3, 5) indicates that a low-wing design requires *more* dihedral to achieve the same level of lateral stability compared to mid-wing or high-wing designs. This implies that the low-wing configuration itself has a destabilizing or less stabilizing effect on roll stability, requiring compensation. The primary reason for this is often related to the keel effect of the fuselage and the interaction of the wing's downwash with the fuselage, which can create a rolling moment that opposes the restoring moment from dihedral or even contribute to instability. Therefore, a low wing generally reduces roll stability.",
          "Step 4: Combine the findings to evaluate the options. Based on Step 2, wing dihedral increases roll stability. Based on Step 3, a low wing reduces roll stability. Option B correctly states both these effects."
