        "reasoning": "To transfer a satellite from an elliptical orbit to a circular orbit at the apogee distance of the elliptical orbit, the maneuver must occur at the apogee. We need to compare the velocity of the satellite at the apogee of the elliptical orbit ($v_{elliptical, apogee}$) with the velocity required for a circular orbit at that same radius ($v_{circular, target}$). \\n\\n1.  **Velocity in an elliptical orbit (Vis-viva equation):** The speed $v$ at any radial distance $r$ in an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a_{ellipse}$ is given by: \\n    $v^2 = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a_{ellipse}} \\right)$ \\n    At the apogee, $r = r_a$. Also, for an ellipse, the semi-major axis is $a_{ellipse} = \\frac{r_p + r_a}{2}$, where $r_p$ is the perigee radius and $r_a$ is the apogee radius. \\n    Substituting $a_{ellipse}$: \\n    $v_{elliptical, apogee}^2 = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{(r_p + r_a)/2} \\right) = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{2}{r_p + r_a} \\right)$ \\n\\n2.  **Velocity in a circular orbit:** The speed $v_c$ for a circular orbit of radius $r$ is given by: \\n    $v_c^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{r}$ \\n    For the target circular orbit, the radius is $r_a$. So, the required circular velocity is: \\n    $v_{circular, target}^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{r_a}$ \\n\\n3.  **Comparison:** We compare the terms inside the square root for $v_{elliptical, apogee}^2$ and $v_{circular, target}^2$: \\n    Compare $\\left( \\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{2}{r_p + r_a} \\right)$ with $\\left( \\frac{1}{r_a} \\right)$. \\n    Let's simplify the elliptical term: \\n    $\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{2}{r_p + r_a} = \\frac{2(r_p + r_a) - 2r_a}{r_a(r_p + r_a)} = \\frac{2r_p + 2r_a - 2r_a}{r_a(r_p + r_a)} = \\frac{2r_p}{r_a(r_p + r_a)}$ \\n    Now, we compare $\\frac{2r_p}{r_a(r_p + r_a)}$ with $\\frac{1}{r_a}$. \\n    Since $r_a > 0$, we can multiply both sides by $r_a$: \\n    Compare $\\frac{2r_p}{r_p + r_a}$ with $1$. \\n    For an elliptical orbit, $r_a > r_p$. Therefore, $r_p + r_a > 2r_p$. \\n    This implies $\\frac{2r_p}{r_p + r_a} < 1$. \\n\\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since $\\frac{2r_p}{r_p + r_a} < 1$, it follows that $v_{elliptical, apogee}^2 < v_{circular, target}^2$. \\n    Therefore, $v_{elliptical, apogee} < v_{circular, target}$. \\n    To achieve the target circular orbit, the speed of the satellite must be **increased** at the apogee. This corresponds to option A."

          "Step 2: Identify the maneuver point. Since the target circular orbit's radius is $r_a$, the maneuver must be performed at the apogee of the elliptical orbit to make the transfer tangential and efficient.",
          "Step 3: Recall the relevant velocity formulas. For an elliptical orbit, the velocity at any point $r$ is given by the Vis-viva equation: $v = \\sqrt{\\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)}$. For a circular orbit of radius $r$, the velocity is $v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$.",

          "Step 5: Calculate the velocity of the satellite at the apogee of its elliptical orbit ($v_{elliptical, apogee}$) and the required velocity for the target circular orbit ($v_{circular, target}$) at radius $r_a$. Substitute $r=r_a$ and $a=a_{ellipse}$ into the Vis-viva equation for the elliptical velocity. For the circular velocity, use $r=r_a$.",
          "Step 6: Compare $v_{elliptical, apogee}$ and $v_{circular, target}$. By comparing the terms under the square root, it is found that $v_{elliptical, apogee} < v_{circular, target}$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude the required action. Since the current speed at apogee is less than the speed required for the circular orbit, the speed must be increased."
