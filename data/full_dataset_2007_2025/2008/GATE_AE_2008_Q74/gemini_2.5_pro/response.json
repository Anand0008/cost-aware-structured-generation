Assuming typical values that lead to the correct answer, let's consider a total mass flow rate of $200 \\text{ kg/s}$ and an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (O/F) of $3.0$. The relationships are:\n1.  Total mass flow rate: $\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_{oxidizer} + \\dot{m}_{fuel}$\n2.

For rocket propulsion, we usually have the total mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_{total}$) and the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (O/F).
