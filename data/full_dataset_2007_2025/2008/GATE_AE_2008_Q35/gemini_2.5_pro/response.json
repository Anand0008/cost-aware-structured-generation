The lower boundary of this diagram, representing the stall limit, is a parabolic curve. This curve defines the maximum load factor an aircraft can achieve at a given speed before stalling (i.e., reaching its maximum lift coefficient, $C_{L,max}$). The relationship between load factor ($n$), current speed ($V$), and stall speed ($V_{stall}$) is given by: $n = \\frac{V^2}{V_{stall}^2}$.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum speed at which the aircraft should be designed to withstand a maximum vertical load factor of 9. This corresponds to the point on the V-n diagram where the aerodynamic stall limit (the parabolic curve) intersects the structural load factor limit (a horizontal line at $n=9$). At this specific speed, often called the maneuvering speed ($V_A$), the aircraft can achieve its maximum structural load factor by utilizing its maximum lift capability without exceeding structural limits or stalling.\n\nGiven:\n*   Stalling speed ($V_{stall}$) = 60 m/s EAS\n*   Maximum vertical load factor ($n$) = 9\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n$9 = \\frac{V^2}{(60)^2}$\n\nSolve for $V$:\n$V^2 = 9 \\times (60)^2$\n$V = \\sqrt{9 \\times (60)^2}$\n$V = 3 \\times 60$\n$V = 180$ m/s\n\nTherefore, the minimum speed at which the aircraft should be designed to withstand a maximum vertical load factor of 9 is 180 m/s."
