For the same true airspeed ($V$), air density ($\\rho$), and wing area ($S$), the required lift coefficient $C_L = 2L/(\\rho V^2 S)$ is lower than that for steady level flight where $L = W$. Since induced drag is proportional to $C_L^2$, it is lower in climb. Parasitic (zero-lift) drag remains approximately constant at the same speed. Therefore, total aerodynamic drag is lower in a steady climb compared to steady level flight at the same forward speed."
