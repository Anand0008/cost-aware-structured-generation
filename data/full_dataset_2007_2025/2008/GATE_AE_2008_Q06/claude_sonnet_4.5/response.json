        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C, the drag of an aircraft in steady climbing flight at a given forward speed is lower than the drag in steady level flight at the same forward speed. This is because the lift coefficient required during the climb is lower than the lift coefficient in level flight at the same speed, as the lift force needed to support the aircraft's weight is reduced by the cosine of the climb angle. The lower lift coefficient results in a reduction in the induced drag component, which is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient. While the parasite drag may be slightly higher due to the different flow conditions, the overall drag is lower during the climb compared to level flight at the same speed."
