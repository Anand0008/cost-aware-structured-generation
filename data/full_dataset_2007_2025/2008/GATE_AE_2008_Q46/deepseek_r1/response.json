        "reasoning": "The given critical pressure coefficient $C_{p,cr} = -0.78$ at $M_\\infty = 0.7$ is the threshold value at which the local flow becomes sonic ($M_{local}=1$). The minimum pressure coefficient in incompressible flow is $C_{p0,min} = -0.6$. For $M_\\infty = 0.7$, the compressibility-corrected pressure coefficient at the same point is given by the Prandtl-Glauert rule: $C_p = C_{p0} / \\sqrt{1 - M_\\infty^2}$. Calculating: $C_p = -0.6 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.7^2} = -0.6 / \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx -0.84$. Since $|C_p| > |C_{p,cr}|$ (i.e., $-0.84 < -0.78$), the actual pressure coefficient is more negative than the critical value. This means the local pressure is lower than the pressure required for sonic flow, so the local Mach number at that point exceeds 1, indicating a supersonic pocket. However, the freestream Mach number is 0.7 (<1), so the flow is partly subsonic and partly supersonic, characteristic of the transonic regime."

One minor gap: the exact formula for $C_{p,cr}$ was given in a chunk but not directly used as the value was provided. Overall, RAG context was very helpful."
