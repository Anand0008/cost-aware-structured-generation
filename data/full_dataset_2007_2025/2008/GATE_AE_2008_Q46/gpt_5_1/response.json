By definition, C_{p,cr} is the pressure coefficient at which the local Mach number first reaches 1 (sonic) on the airfoil surface. Also given: for this airfoil in incompressible flow, the minimum pressure coefficient is C_{p,min,inc} = -0.6.\\n\\nTo estimate the compressible minimum Cp at M_\\infty = 0.7, we use the Prandtl-Glauert rule for subsonic compressible flow: \\nC_p \\approx \\dfrac{C_{p,inc}}{\\sqrt{1 - M_\\infty^2}}.\\nFor M_\\infty = 0.7, \\sqrt{1 - M_\\infty^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.49} = \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx 0.714. Thus, the compressible minimum pressure coefficient is approximately\\nC_{p,min} \\approx \\dfrac{-0.6}{0.714} \\approx -0.84.\\n\\nCompare this with the critical value: C_{p,min} \\approx -0.84 < C_{p,cr} = -0.78 (more negative). When the actual minimum Cp is more negative than C_{p,cr}, the local flow has expanded enough that somewhere on the surface the local Mach number exceeds 1, creating a pocket of supersonic flow terminated by a shock. The free stream is still subsonic (M_\\infty = 0.7), so the overall flow field is partly subsonic (far field and parts of the surface) and partly supersonic (local region near Cp,min). This is the definition of a transonic-like mixed flow regime. Therefore, the correct qualitative description is \\\"partly subsonic and partly supersonic\\\", which corresponds to option D."
