The minimum pressure coefficient ($C_p$) in incompressible flow is given as -0.6. \n\nAccording to the Prandtl-Glauert rule, the pressure coefficient in compressible flow is related to the incompressible $C_p$ by the factor $1/\\sqrt{1-M_\\infty^2}$. At $M_\\infty = 0.7$, this factor is approximately 1.11.\n\nSince the critical pressure coefficient $C_{p,cr}$ is more negative than the incompressible $C_p$ of -0.6, this means that the local Mach number on the airfoil has reached 1.0 at some point. Therefore, the flow is partly subsonic and partly supersonic, which corresponds to option D."
