If the local pressure coefficient becomes more negative than $C_{p,cr}$, it implies that the local Mach number has exceeded 1.0.\n\nGiven:\n1. Freestream Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$) = 0.7\n2. Critical pressure coefficient ($C_{p,cr}$) = -0.78 (This is the value of $C_p$ at which $M_{local}=1$ for $M_{\\infty}=0.7$)\n3. Minimum pressure coefficient for the airfoil in incompressible flow ($C_{p,min,inc}$) = -0.6\n\nStep 1: Calculate the actual minimum pressure coefficient ($C_{p,min}$) on the airfoil at the given freestream Mach number ($M_{\\infty} = 0.7$) using the Prandtl-Glauert rule. The Prandtl-Glauert rule states:\n$C_p = \\frac{C_{p,inc}}{\\sqrt{1 - M_{\\infty}^2}}$\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given values into the formula:\n$C_{p,min} = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.7)^2}}$\n$C_{p,min} = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.49}}$\n$C_{p,min} = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{0.51}}$\n$C_{p,min} \\approx \\frac{-0.6}{0.71414}$\n$C_{p,min} \\approx -0.840$\n\nStep 3: Compare the calculated actual minimum pressure coefficient ($C_{p,min}$) with the given critical pressure coefficient ($C_{p,cr}$):\nCalculated $C_{p,min} \\approx -0.840$\nGiven $C_{p,cr} = -0.78$\n\nSince $C_{p,min}$ (approximately -0.840) is more negative than $C_{p,cr}$ (-0.78), it means that the pressure at the minimum pressure point on the airfoil has dropped below the critical pressure. A more negative pressure coefficient corresponds to a lower pressure and, consequently, a higher local velocity. Therefore, the local Mach number at this point on the airfoil surface has exceeded 1.0.\n\nStep 4: Determine the flow regime.\nWhen the freestream Mach number is subsonic ($M_{\\infty} = 0.7 < 1.0$) but local regions on the airfoil surface experience supersonic flow ($M_{local} > 1.0$), the flow is characterized as \"partly subsonic and partly supersonic\" or transonic flow.

If the local pressure coefficient becomes more negative than $C_{p,cr}$, it implies the local Mach number has exceeded 1.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent definitions of critical Mach number and critical pressure coefficient, and crucially, the Prandtl-Glauert rule, which was essential for solving the problem. The explanation of transonic flow regimes was also very helpful and directly supported the conclusion."
