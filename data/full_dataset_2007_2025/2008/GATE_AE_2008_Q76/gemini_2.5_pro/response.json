For a single application over the interval $[a, b]$, the rule uses three points: $x_1 = a$, $x_2 = \\frac{a+b}{2}$ (the midpoint), and $x_3 = b$. The step size $h$ for this single application is given by $h = \\frac{b-a}{2}$. The formula for Simpson's 1/3 rule is:\n$$I \\approx \\frac{h}{3} (f(x_1) + 4f(x_2) + f(x_3))$$\nSubstituting $h = \\frac{b-a}{2}$ and the function values $f(x_1) = f(a)$, $f(x_2) = f(\\frac{a+b}{2})$, and $f(x_3) = f(b)$ into the formula:\n$$I \\approx \\frac{(b-a)/2}{3} (f(a) + 4f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + f(b))$$\n$$I \\approx \\frac{b-a}{6} (f(a) + 4f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + f(b))$$\nTo match the format of the options, we can factor out $\\frac{b-a}{2}$:\n$$I \\approx \\frac{b-a}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}f(a) + \\frac{4}{3}f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + \\frac{1}{3}f(b) \\right)$$\nComparing this with the given options:\nOption A: $\\frac{b-a}{2} [f(b) + f(\\frac{a+b}{2})]$ - Incorrect.\nOption B: $\\frac{b-a}{2} [f(a) + \\frac{f(b)}{2} + f(\\frac{a+b}{2})]$ - Incorrect.\nOption C: $\\frac{b-a}{2} [\\frac{f(a)}{3} + \\frac{f(b)}{3} + \\frac{4}{3} f(\\frac{a+b}{2})]$ - This matches the derived formula.\nOption D: $\\frac{b-a}{2} [f(a) + \\frac{f(b)}{3} + \\frac{4}{3} f(\\frac{a+b}{3})]$ - Incorrect, the midpoint is wrong and coefficients are incorrect."
