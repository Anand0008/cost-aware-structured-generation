        "reasoning": "The question requires matching aircraft dynamic modes with their characteristic properties. Based on fundamental flight mechanics principles and the provided RAG context:\n\n1.  **P. Short period mode:** This mode is characterized by rapid, heavily damped oscillations primarily involving angle of attack and pitch rate, with the forward speed remaining nearly constant. (Refer to CHUNK 1, 3, 6: 'relatively constant forward speed', 'assuming u constant for short period', 'negligible change in airspeed'). This matches Group II, item **4. Speed remains constant**.\n\n2.  **Q. Wing rock:** This is a lateral-directional phenomenon, often observed at high angles of attack, characterized by sustained or limit-cycle **roll oscillations**. This matches Group II, item **3. Roll oscillations**.\n\n3.  **R. Phugoid mode:** This mode is a slow, lightly damped oscillation involving exchanges between kinetic (speed) and potential (altitude) energy, during which the **angle of attack remains nearly constant**. (Refer to CHUNK 1, 3, 6: 'angle of attack (alpha) remains nearly constant', 'assuming alpha constant for phugoid', 'typically at a nearly constant angle of attack'). This matches Group II, item **2. Angle of attack remains constant**.\n\n4.  **S. Dutch roll:** This is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode involving **coupled roll-yaw oscillations** and sideslip. (Refer to CHUNK 2, 4, 5: 'oscillatory motion involving roll, yaw, and sideslip', 'coupled roll-yaw oscillations'). This matches Group II, item **1.
