So P must match \"Speed remains constant\" (4).\n\n2) Wing rock: This is a lateral phenomenon characterized by rolling oscillations of the wings (rocking from side to side). So Q must match \"Roll oscillations\" (3).\n\n3) Phugoid mode: A long-period longitudinal oscillation where kinetic and potential energy exchange; the angle of attack remains nearly constant while speed and altitude vary. So R must match \"Angle of attack remains constant\" (2).\n\n4) Dutch roll: A coupled lateral-directional oscillation involving roll and yaw. So S must match \"Coupled roll-yaw oscillations\" (1).\n\nThus the correct mapping is: P-4, Q-3, R-2, S-1, which corresponds to option B. This matches standard textbook and RAG descriptions of short period, phugoid, wing rock, and Dutch roll."

This was highly relevant for confirming which variable remains nearly constant in each longitudinal mode and the nature of Dutch roll. Wing rock was not explicitly covered in RAG, but is standard knowledge in flight dynamics."
