The matches are: Short Period (P) - Speed remains constant (4); Wing Rock (Q) - Roll oscillations (3); Phugoid (R) - Angle of attack remains constant (2); Dutch Roll (S) - Coupled roll-yaw oscillations (1). This is corroborated by the retrieved knowledge which states that in the short period mode, forward speed is relatively constant (Chunk 1), while angle of attack remains nearly constant in the phugoid mode (Chunk 1, 3, 6). Dutch roll is described as a coupled roll-yaw oscillation (Chunks 2, 5).
