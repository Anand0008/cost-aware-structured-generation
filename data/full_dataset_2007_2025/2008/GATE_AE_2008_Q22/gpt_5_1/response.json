Thus: slowest at distance r_1 implies r_1 = r_a (apocenter), and fastest at distance r_2 implies r_2 = r_p (pericenter). For an ellipse with semi-major axis a and eccentricity e, the pericenter and apocenter distances are r_p = a(1 - e) and r_a = a(1 + e). Identifying r_a = r_1 and r_p = r_2, we have r_1 = a(1 + e), r_2 = a(1 - e). Subtracting and adding: r_1 - r_2 = a[(1 + e) - (1 - e)] = 2ae, and r_1 + r_2 = a[(1 + e) + (1 - e)] = 2a.
