Therefore:\n*   $r_1$ corresponds to the apocenter distance, $r_a$.\n*   $r_2$ corresponds to the pericenter distance, $r_p$.\n\nFrom orbital mechanics (RAG Chunk 2), the formulas for apocenter and pericenter distances in an elliptical orbit are:\n*   $r_a = a(1 + e)$  (Equation 1)\n*   $r_p = a(1 - e)$  (Equation 2)\n\nWhere $a$ is the semi-major axis and $e$ is the eccentricity.\n\nSubstitute $r_1$ for $r_a$ and $r_2$ for $r_p$:\n*   $r_1 = a(1 + e)$\n*   $r_2 = a(1 - e)$\n\nWe need to find $e$. We can eliminate $a$ by dividing the two equations or by solving for $a$ and substituting.\n\nMethod 1: Division\n$\\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{a(1 + e)}{a(1 - e)} = \\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}$\n$r_1(1 - e) = r_2(1 + e)$\n$r_1 - r_1 e = r_2 + r_2 e$\n$r_1 - r_2 = r_1 e + r_2 e$\n$r_1 - r_2 = e(r_1 + r_2)$\n$e = \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{r_1 + r_2}$\n\nThis matches option B."
