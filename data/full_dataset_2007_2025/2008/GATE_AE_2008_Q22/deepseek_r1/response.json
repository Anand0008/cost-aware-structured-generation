Therefore, given distances r1 (slowest) and r2 (fastest), we have r1 = r_a (apocenter distance) and r2 = r_p (pericenter distance). The standard formulas are r_p = a(1 - e) and r_a = a(1 + e), where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'e' is eccentricity. Solving these simultaneously yields e = (r_a - r_p) / (r_a + r_p).

Therefore, distance r1 (at slowest) is the apocenter distance (r_a), and distance r2 (at fastest) is the pericenter distance (r_p).",
