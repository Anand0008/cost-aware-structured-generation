From the given information:\n- The top booms have an area of 0.2 cm^2 each\n- The bottom boom has an area of 0.1 cm^2\n- The bending moment My is acting on the cross-section\nFor a given bending moment, the normal stress is proportional to the distance from the neutral axis and inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. Since the top and bottom booms are equidistant from the neutral axis, the ratio of their normal stresses will be equal to the ratio of their areas. \nThe ratio of the top boom area to the bottom boom area is 0.2 cm^2 / 0.1 cm^2 = 2. \nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of normal stress in the top booms to that of the bottom boom is 2/1 = 5/2."
