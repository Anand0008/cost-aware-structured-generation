        "reasoning": "The symmetry of the stress tensor ($\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$) is a fundamental result in continuum mechanics. It is derived by applying the principle of balance of angular momentum (i.e., moment equilibrium) to an infinitesimal material element. For rotational equilibrium, the sum of moments about any axis must be zero. This condition forces complementary shear stresses to be equal (e.g., $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$). Force equilibrium (linear momentum balance) yields the stress equilibrium equations but does not impose symmetry. Linear stress-strain relations (Hooke's Law) define material behavior but are not the source of stress tensor symmetry. Compatibility conditions ensure strain field continuity and are unrelated to stress symmetry derivation."

          "Step 3: Consider the equilibrium of an infinitesimal cubical element within a deformable body. For the element to be in complete static equilibrium, both linear and angular momentum balances must be satisfied.",
          "Step 4: Apply the balance of angular momentum (moment equilibrium). Take moments about the center of the cube. The moments are primarily due to shear stresses on the faces. Body forces and inertial terms contribute moments of higher order (proportional to volume * length) and vanish in the limit as the element size goes to zero, especially in the absence of body moments.",
          "Step 5: Derive the equality. For example, considering moments about the z-axis, shear stresses $\\tau_{xy}$ and $\\tau_{yx}$ create opposing moments. Setting the net moment to zero yields $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$. Repeating for other axes gives $\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{zx}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = \\tau_{zy}$.",
