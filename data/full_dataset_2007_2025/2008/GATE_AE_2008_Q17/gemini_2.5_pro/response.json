        "reasoning": "The symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor, which implies the equality of complementary shear stresses (e.g., $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$), is a direct consequence of the moment equilibrium (or rotational equilibrium/balance of angular momentum) of an infinitesimal element within a continuum. If the shear stresses were not equal, the element would experience an unbalanced moment and undergo angular acceleration, violating the condition of equilibrium. Force equilibrium conditions (balance of linear momentum) lead to the differential equations of equilibrium but do not, by themselves, prove the symmetry of the stress tensor. Linear relations between stresses and strains (constitutive laws like Hooke's Law) and compatibility conditions (kinematic relations ensuring continuous deformation) are separate principles in continuum mechanics and do not derive stress tensor symmetry. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 3, 4, 5, and 6) explicitly confirms that moment equilibrium is the basis for stress tensor symmetry."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the Stress Tensor and its Symmetry.** The stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ describes the state of stress at a point. Its symmetry means that $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, which is particularly important for shear stress components (e.g., $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$).",
          "**Step 2: Recall Fundamental Equilibrium Principles.** In continuum mechanics, for any body or infinitesimal element to be in equilibrium (static or dynamic without angular acceleration), two fundamental conditions must be met: force equilibrium (balance of linear momentum) and moment equilibrium (balance of angular momentum).",
          "**Step 3: Analyze Force Equilibrium.** Force equilibrium ensures that the net force on an element is zero. This leads to the differential equations of equilibrium (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} + X = 0$). These equations relate stress gradients to body forces but do not inherently require the equality of complementary shear stresses ($\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$).",
          "**Step 4: Analyze Moment Equilibrium.** Moment equilibrium (rotational equilibrium) ensures that the net moment (torque) on an element is zero. Consider an infinitesimal cubic element. If we sum the moments about an axis (e.g., the z-axis) passing through its center, the moments generated by the complementary shear stresses (e.g., $\\tau_{xy}$ and $\\tau_{yx}$) must balance each other. For this balance to occur, the magnitudes of these complementary shear stresses must be equal.",
          "**Step 5: Conclude the Derivation Source.** Therefore, the symmetry of the stress tensor, specifically the equality of complementary shear stresses, is a direct consequence of satisfying the moment equilibrium conditions for an infinitesimal element.",
          "**Step 6: Evaluate Other Options.** Linear relations between stresses and strains (constitutive laws) describe material behavior. Compatibility conditions ensure that strains are physically possible and lead to a continuous deformation field. Neither of these principles directly derives the symmetry of the stress tensor."
