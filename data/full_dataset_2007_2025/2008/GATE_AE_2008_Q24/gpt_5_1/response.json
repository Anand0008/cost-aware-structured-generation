Options A, B, C can be falsified by simple counterexamples, while D is a known vector identity.\n\n1) Test A: \\(\\vec p \\times \\vec q + \\vec q \\times \\vec r + \\vec r \\times \\vec p = 0\\)?\nTake \\(\\vec p = \\hat i, \\vec q = \\hat j, \\vec r = \\hat k\\).\n\\(\\vec p \\times \\vec q = \\hat k\\), \\(\\vec q \\times \\vec r = \\hat i\\), \\(\\vec r \\times \\vec p = \\hat j\\).\nSum = \\(\\hat i + \\hat j + \\hat k \\neq 0\\). So A is false.\n\n2) Test B: \\((\\vec p \\cdot \\vec q)\\vec r + (\\vec q \\cdot \\vec r)\\vec p + (\\vec r \\cdot \\vec p)\\vec q = 0\\)?\nUse same \\(\\hat i, \\hat j, \\hat k\\). All dot products are zero, so expression is zero for this case, but we must hold for all vectors. Take \\(\\vec p = \\vec q = \\vec r = \\hat i\\). Then each dot product is 1, so expression = \\(1\\cdot \\hat i + 1\\cdot \\hat i + 1\\cdot \\hat i = 3\\hat i \\neq 0\\). So B is false.\n\n3) Test C: \\(\\vec p \\cdot (\\vec q \\times \\vec r) + \\vec q \\cdot (\\vec r \\times \\vec p) + \\vec r \\cdot (\\vec p \\times \\vec q) = 0\\)?\nEach term is a scalar triple product. But the scalar triple product is cyclically invariant: \\(\\vec p \\cdot (\\vec q \\times \\vec r) = \\vec q \\cdot (\\vec r \\times \\vec p) = \\vec r \\cdot (\\vec p \\times \\vec q)\\). So the sum is \\(3\\,\\vec p \\cdot (\\vec q \\times \\vec r)\\), which is not always zero. For \\(\\vec p = \\hat i, \\vec q = \\hat j, \\vec r = \\hat k\\), each term is 1, so sum = 3, not 0. So C is false.\n\n4) Option D: \\(\\vec p \\times (\\vec q \\times \\vec r) + \\vec q \\times (\\vec r \\times \\vec p) + \\vec r \\times (\\vec p \\times \\vec q) = 0\\).\nUse the vector triple product identity: \\(\\vec a \\times (\\vec b \\times \\vec c) = \\vec b (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c) - \\vec c (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)\\).\nApply to each term:\n\\(\\vec p \\times (\\vec q \\times \\vec r) = \\vec q (\\vec p \\cdot \\vec r) - \\vec r (\\vec p \\cdot \\vec q)\\).\n\\(\\vec q \\times (\\vec r \\times \\vec p) = \\vec r (\\vec q \\cdot \\vec p) - \\vec p (\\vec q \\cdot \\vec r)\\).\n\\(\\vec r \\times (\\vec p \\times \\vec q) = \\vec p (\\vec r \\cdot \\vec q) - \\vec q (\\vec r \\cdot \\vec p)\\).\nSum all three: coefficients of each vector cancel pairwise because dot products are symmetric (\\(\\vec p \\cdot \\vec q = \\vec q \\cdot \\vec p\\), etc.). The total is \\(\\vec 0\\) for all \\(\\vec p, \\vec q, \\vec r\\). Hence D is always true and is the correct choice."
