        "reasoning": "The question describes a steady, inviscid flow in a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle with a normal shock in the divergent portion. According to compressible flow theory and as supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):\n\n1.  **Normal Shock Properties:** When a normal shock occurs in a supersonic flow (which is the case in the divergent section of a choked CD nozzle before the shock), the flow abruptly transitions from supersonic to subsonic. Across the shock, there is a sudden increase in static pressure, temperature, and density, and a decrease in Mach number and stagnation pressure.\n\n2.  **Flow Downstream of Shock:** Immediately downstream of the normal shock, the flow is subsonic (`M < 1`).\n\n3.  **Subsonic Flow in a Divergent Section:** For subsonic flow, a divergent area acts as a diffuser. In a diffuser, as the flow area increases, the velocity decreases, and consequently, the static pressure increases. This is a fundamental principle of compressible flow (derived from the continuity, momentum, and energy equations, or simply from the area-velocity relation for subsonic flow).\n\n4.  **Isentropic Assumption:** While the normal shock itself is a non-isentropic process (entropy increases, stagnation pressure decreases), the flow *after* the shock, in the remaining divergent section up to the exit, can be considered isentropic if no further shocks or significant frictional losses are assumed. Therefore, the pressure increase in this subsonic diffuser-like section is an isentropic process.\n\nCombining these points, the static pressure along the nozzle downstream of the normal shock (where the flow is subsonic) will increase isentropically towards the static pressure at the nozzle exit. This matches option B."

          "Step 3: Analyze the flow regime downstream of the shock. Since the flow is now subsonic and continues through the divergent section of the nozzle, this section acts as a diffuser for the subsonic flow.",
          "Step 4: Understand the behavior of subsonic flow in a diffuser. For subsonic flow, an increasing area (divergent section) leads to a decrease in velocity and a corresponding increase in static pressure. This is consistent with the area-velocity relation for compressible flow.",
          "Step 5: Consider the 'isentropic' aspect. While the shock itself is non-isentropic, the flow *after* the shock, assuming no further losses or shocks, can be treated as isentropic as it continues to expand/diffuse to the exit pressure. Thus, the pressure increase is considered isentropic.",
