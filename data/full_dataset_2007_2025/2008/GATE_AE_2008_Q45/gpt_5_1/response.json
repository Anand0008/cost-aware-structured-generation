        "reasoning": "Upstream of the normal shock, the flow in the divergent section is supersonic and (by assumption) isentropic. Across the normal shock, there is a sudden non-isentropic jump: pressure increases, Mach number drops to subsonic, and stagnation pressure decreases. The question, however, asks specifically about the static pressure *downstream of the normal shock* along the nozzle. In the divergent portion downstream of the shock, the flow is subsonic and, under the given assumptions (steady, inviscid, and no further shocks), it again behaves as a quasi-one-dimensional isentropic flow. For subsonic flow in a diverging duct, area increases cause deceleration and hence an increase in static pressure. Therefore, from the shock location to the nozzle exit, the static pressure increases smoothly and isentropically up to the exit static pressure. This matches option B. Options A and C contradict the basic area–Mach number relation for subsonic flow in a diverging passage, and D is incorrect because the *trend* (increase) is fixed; only the magnitude depends on exit conditions."
