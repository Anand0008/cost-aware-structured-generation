This is because the compressibility effects become more significant at higher Mach numbers, leading to changes in the fluid properties within the boundary layer, such as density and viscosity. The reference temperature method is used to account for these compressibility effects, which show that the skin friction coefficient decreases more rapidly for turbulent flows compared to laminar flows as the Mach number increases."
