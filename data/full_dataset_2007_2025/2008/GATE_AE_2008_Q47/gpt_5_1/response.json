        "reasoning": "For a turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate, the incompressible local or average skin-friction coefficient scales approximately as $C_f \\propto Re^{-1/5}$, independent of Mach number. In compressible flow, however, $C_f$ becomes a function of both Reynolds number and Mach number. Anderson (Intro to Aerodynamics, Ch. 19; Introduction to Flight, Ch. 4, \\S4.18) states that for a given Reynolds number, increasing the free-stream Mach number causes the skin-friction coefficient to decrease, and this reduction is more pronounced for turbulent boundary layers. Physically, at higher Mach numbers, strong viscous heating within the boundary layer raises the temperature, which alters density and viscosity distributions; when these effects are accounted for (e.g., via reference temperature methods), the effective skin-friction coefficient referenced to free-stream conditions is lower. The question explicitly fixes Reynolds number and asks how $C_f$ changes with Mach number in a turbulent boundary layer, so the correct qualitative trend is that $C_f$ decreases. Hence option A is consistent with standard compressible turbulent boundary-layer theory and the given RAG sources."
