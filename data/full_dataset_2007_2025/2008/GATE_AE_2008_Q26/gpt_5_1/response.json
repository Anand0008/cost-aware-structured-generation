Option A is exactly of this form with $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$, so it must be a solution. For completeness, direct substitution confirms this: for $y = e^{-x} + x e^{-x}$, we get $y' = -x e^{-x}$ and $y'' = (x-1)e^{-x}$. Then $y'' + 2y' + y = (x-1)e^{-x} + 2(-x e^{-x}) + (e^{-x} + x e^{-x}) = 0$. Other options do not match the general solution form and will not satisfy the ODE."
