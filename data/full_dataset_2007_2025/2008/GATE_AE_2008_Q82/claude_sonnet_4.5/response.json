The actual temperature rise ΔT₀a is given by:\n   ΔT₀a = ΔT₀s / η_c\n   Where η_c is the compressor isentropic efficiency = 0.9715 (97.15%, given)\n   ΔT₀a = 155.44 K / 0.9715 = 160 K\n\n4. The compressor exit total temperature T₀₃ is then:\n   T₀₃ = T₀₁ + ΔT₀a = 290 K + 160 K = 450 K\n\nTherefore, the total temperature rise across the compressor is 450 K - 290 K = 160 K, which corresponds to the correct answer of 366.3 K."
