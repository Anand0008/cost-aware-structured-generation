The actual total temperature rise $\\Delta T_{0a} = T_{02} - T_{01}$ is what the question asks for. In a real compressor, $\\Delta T_{0a} = \\Delta T_{0s} / \\eta_c$. However, without the full problem statement (e.g., inlet conditions, pressure ratio, efficiency), we cannot independently verify the calculation.
