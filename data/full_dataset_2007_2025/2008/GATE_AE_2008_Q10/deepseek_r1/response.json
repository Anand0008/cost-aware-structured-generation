Applying Bernoulli's equation from the freestream to a stagnation point (where $V=0$) gives $p_0 = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2$. Substituting $p_0$ for $p$ yields $C_p = (p_0 - p_\\infty) / (\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2) = 1$. This is the maximum attainable pressure in incompressible flow, as Bernoulli's equation dictates that pressure increases only at the expense of kinetic energy; the stagnation point represents the complete conversion of dynamic pressure to static pressure. Higher values would violate the conservation of energy for an incompressible fluid."
