To find the maximum possible value of $C_p$, the term $\\left(\\frac{V}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2$ must be minimized. Since velocity $V$ cannot be negative, its minimum possible value is $0$. This condition occurs at a stagnation point, where the fluid comes to a complete stop relative to the body. Substituting $V=0$ into the formula yields $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2 = 1 - 0 = 1$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $C_p$ in incompressible flow is 1.
