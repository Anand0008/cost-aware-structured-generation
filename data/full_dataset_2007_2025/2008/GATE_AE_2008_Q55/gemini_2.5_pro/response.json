        "reasoning": "When an afterburner is switched on, additional fuel is injected and burned in the exhaust stream downstream of the turbine. This process significantly increases the stagnation temperature of the exhaust gases before they enter the nozzle (as described in RAG Chunks 4, 5, 6). A higher exhaust gas temperature leads to a higher exhaust velocity, which directly results in a substantial increase in engine thrust (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6). However, this thrust augmentation comes at a significant cost to fuel efficiency. The afterburner burns fuel at a lower pressure and temperature compared to the main combustor, making the process thermodynamically less efficient (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4). Consequently, a large amount of additional fuel is consumed for the thrust increase, leading to a disproportionately higher increase in the specific fuel consumption (SFC), which is defined as the fuel mass flow rate per unit thrust (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, both thrust and SFC increase."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of an afterburner. An afterburner is a component in a turbojet engine that injects and burns additional fuel in the hot, oxygen-rich exhaust gases exiting the turbine, before they enter the nozzle (RAG Chunks 4, 5, 6).",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect of afterburning on exhaust gas properties. The combustion of additional fuel in the afterburner significantly increases the total temperature of the exhaust gases (RAG Chunks 4, 5, 6).",
          "Step 3: Determine the impact on thrust. An increase in exhaust gas temperature and, consequently, exhaust velocity directly leads to a substantial increase in the engine's thrust (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6). This thrust augmentation can be 30-100% depending on the design and operating conditions.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the effect on fuel consumption. Activating the afterburner requires injecting a large amount of additional fuel, which dramatically increases the total fuel mass flow rate of the engine (RAG Chunks 4, 5, 6).",
          "Step 5: Assess the change in specific fuel consumption (SFC). SFC is defined as the fuel mass flow rate divided by the thrust ($SFC = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$). Although thrust increases, the fuel consumption increases even more significantly due to the inefficient burning process in the afterburner (heat addition at lower pressure and temperature). This results in a substantial increase in SFC (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).",
          "Step 6: Conclude the combined effect. Based on the analysis, both thrust and specific fuel consumption increase when the afterburner is switched on."
