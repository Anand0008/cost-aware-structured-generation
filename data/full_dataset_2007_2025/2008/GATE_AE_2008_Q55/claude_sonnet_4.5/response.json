This increases the stagnation temperature (T05) and velocity (V7) of the exhaust, leading to a significant increase in thrust. However, the additional fuel consumption also dramatically increases the specific fuel consumption (SFC).\n\nThe key principles are:\n1. Afterburning increases the exhaust temperature and velocity, augmenting thrust.\n2. Afterburning requires significantly more fuel, leading to a higher SFC.\nThus, both thrust and SFC increase when the afterburner is switched on, as the thrust boost comes at the cost of much higher fuel consumption."
