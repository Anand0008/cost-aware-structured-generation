        "reasoning": "Activating an afterburner involves burning additional fuel in the exhaust nozzle, increasing the exhaust temperature and thus exit velocity. Thrust is directly proportional to the change in momentum (mass flow * (V_exit - V_inlet)). Higher exit velocity increases thrust. Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) is fuel flow rate per unit thrust. The additional fuel flow rate for the afterburner is significant and is burned at a lower thermodynamic efficiency (due to lower pressure), leading to a proportionally larger increase in fuel flow than the increase in thrust. Therefore, SFC increases. This fundamental trade-off is well-documented in propulsion textbooks and is explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge chunks (1, 2, 4, 5, 6)."

          "Step 3: Relate temperature to thrust. The nozzle converts this increased thermal energy to kinetic energy, resulting in a higher exhaust jet velocity (V_e). Thrust F = ṁ_a * (V_e - V_0) + (P_e - P_0)*A_e. For simplified ideal case, thrust increases with V_e.",
          "Step 4: Identify the effect on fuel flow. Activating the afterburner adds a substantial secondary fuel flow (ṁ_f_AB) to the existing main combustor fuel flow (ṁ_f_main). Total fuel flow increases significantly.",
          "Step 5: Define Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). SFC = ṁ_f_total / F. It is a measure of fuel efficiency (lower is better).",
          "Step 6: Analyze the trade-off. The percentage increase in thrust due to afterburning (typically 60-80%) is outweighed by the percentage increase in total fuel flow (can be >100%). Therefore, the ratio SFC = ṁ_f_total / F increases.",
