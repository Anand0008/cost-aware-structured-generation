This is a standard property.\n\n2.  **Laplace Transform of $t \\cdot y(t)$:** The Laplace transform of a function $y(t)$ multiplied by $t$ is given by the property:\n    $L\\{t \\cdot y(t)\\} = -\\frac{d}{ds}Y(s)$\n    This property is explicitly mentioned in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 5 and Chunk 6).\n\nComparing these derived properties with the given options:\n*   Option A: $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = \\frac{dY}{ds}$, $L\\{t y(t)\\} = sY(s)$ (Incorrect)\n*   Option B: $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = sY(s)$, $L\\{t y(t)\\} = -\\frac{dY}{ds}$ (Matches our derivation)\n*   Option C: $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = \\frac{dY}{ds}$, $L\\{t y(t)\\} = Y(s-1)$ (Incorrect)\n*   Option D: $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = sY(s)$, $L\\{t y(t)\\} = e^{as}Y(s)$ (Incorrect)\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.
