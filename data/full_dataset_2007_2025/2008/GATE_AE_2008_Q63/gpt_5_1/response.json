        "reasoning": "The parallelogram plate has two pairs of opposite, parallel sides: top and bottom (length a) loaded by normal stress \\(\\sigma_1\\), and left and right (length b) loaded by normal stress \\(\\sigma_2\\). Each side is subjected to a uniform normal stress acting outward normal to that side. For global equilibrium of the free body, the vector sum of all external forces must be zero. Consider the pair of opposite sides carrying \\(\\sigma_1\\): their outward normals are opposite, so their resultant force is zero for any \\(\\sigma_1\\). Similarly, the pair of sides carrying \\(\\sigma_2\\) also balance each other. However, because the normals of the \\(\\sigma_1\\)-sides are not collinear with the normals of the \\(\\sigma_2\\)-sides (the plate is a parallelogram with angle \\(\\theta\\)), the forces from \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) produce a net couple (moment) unless their magnitudes are equal. The magnitude of the force on each side is stress times area: for unit thickness, \\(F_1 = \\sigma_1 a\\) on each of the two horizontal sides and \\(F_2 = \\sigma_2 b\\) on each of the two inclined sides. These four forces form a closed force polygon only if \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\); otherwise, a non-zero net moment exists about the plate’s centroid. More directly, for a homogeneous state of stress in a body with no body forces, the traction vector on any plane must be derivable from a single stress tensor. For a 2D state with principal stresses aligned with the plate axes, equal normal stresses on all boundaries correspond to a hydrostatic (isotropic) stress state, which is self-equilibrated for any shape. Thus the plate is in equilibrium only when \\(\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_1\\), i.e., option D."

          "Step 2: For static equilibrium, both the net force and the net moment on the plate must be zero.",

          "Step 4: However, because the normals of the \\(\\sigma_1\\)-sides and \\(\\sigma_2\\)-sides are not collinear (they are inclined by angle \\(\\theta\\)), the four boundary forces can form a net couple unless their magnitudes are matched appropriately.",
          "Step 5: For a uniform stress state in a body without body forces, the traction on any boundary must be consistent with a single stress tensor. If all boundary tractions are equal in magnitude and direction-independent (hydrostatic stress), any shape is in self-equilibrium.",
