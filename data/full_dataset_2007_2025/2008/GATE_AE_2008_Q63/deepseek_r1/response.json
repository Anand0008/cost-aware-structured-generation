However, moment equilibrium about any point yields a net moment proportional to (σ₁ - σ₂)abt cosθ. For general θ (θ ≠ 90°), setting this moment to zero requires σ₁ = σ₂. This matches option D. If θ = 90° (rectangle), cosθ = 0 and any σ₁, σ₂ satisfy equilibrium, but the problem likely implies a general parallelogram (θ not 90°), so D is the correct condition."

          "Step 1: Identify geometry and loading. The parallelogram has sides a (horizontal) and b (inclined at angle θ). Normal stress σ₁ acts uniformly on the two sides of length a (top and bottom), and σ₂ acts uniformly on the two sides of length b (left and right). Thickness t is uniform.",
          "Step 2: Determine resultant forces on each side. Forces are: on bottom side (length a): F₁ = σ₁ a t downward at midpoint; on top side: F₃ = σ₁ a t upward at midpoint; on right side (length b): F₂ = σ₂ b t directed outward perpendicular to that side (components: σ₂ b t sinθ in +x, -σ₂ b t cosθ in -y) at its midpoint; on left side: F₄ = σ₂ b t directed outward perpendicular (components: -σ₂ b t sinθ in -x, σ₂ b t cosθ in +y) at its midpoint.",
          "Step 3: Check force equilibrium. Sum forces in x-direction: σ₂ b t sinθ - σ₂ b t sinθ = 0. Sum forces in y-direction: -σ₁ a t - σ₂ b t cosθ + σ₁ a t + σ₂ b t cosθ = 0. So net force is zero for any σ₁, σ₂.",
          "Step 4: Check moment equilibrium about a point (e.g., origin at bottom-left corner). Compute moments due to each force. After simplification, the net moment is M_total = a b t cosθ (σ₁ - σ₂).",
          "Step 5: For equilibrium, M_total must be zero. Assuming a, b, t, and cosθ are nonzero (i.e., θ ≠ 90°), this requires σ₁ = σ₂. If θ = 90° (rectangle), cosθ = 0 and moment is zero automatically, but the problem implies a general parallelogram, so σ₁ = σ₂ is the necessary condition."
