The problem statement here is incomplete because the stress state or relation involving c is missing (likely in a preceding linked sub-question or a figure). However, the method is clear: compute the von Mises equivalent stress as a function of c, set it equal to the yield stress divided by factor of safety (or directly to yield stress if no FoS is specified), and solve for c. Since the numerical details (stress components, yield strength) are not provided in this prompt, I cannot independently recompute the exact numeric value, but the procedure is standard and consistent with the RAG context on von Mises criterion.
