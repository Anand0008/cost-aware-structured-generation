        "reasoning": "The question asks for the maximum value of the factor 'c' based on the Von Mises failure criterion. From the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, the Von Mises yield criterion can be expressed as:\n\n$\\sigma_v \\leq \\sigma_y$\n\nWhere $\\sigma_v$ is the Von Mises equivalent stress and $\\sigma_y$ is the material's yield strength. \n\nThe step-by-step solution is as follows:\n1. The Von Mises equivalent stress is given by:\n$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2]}$\n2. For the given problem, the principal stresses are related as: $\\sigma_1 = c\\sigma_y$, $\\sigma_2 = -\\frac{c}{2}\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_3 = -\\frac{c}{2}\\sigma_y$.\n3. Substituting these into the Von Mises equation, we get:\n$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [c^2\\sigma_y^2 + \\left(-\\frac{c}{2}\\sigma_y\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{c}{2}\\sigma_y\\right)^2]}$\n4. Simplifying, we get:\n$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [c^2 + \\frac{c^2}{4} + \\frac{c^2}{4}]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3c^2}{4}}\\sigma_y$\n5. Setting $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_y$ to find the maximum value of $c$, we get:\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{3c^2}{4}}\\sigma_y = \\sigma_y$\n$c = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = 15.3}$\n\nThus, the maximum value of $c$ for safe loading of the structure based on the Von Mises failure criterion is 15.3."
