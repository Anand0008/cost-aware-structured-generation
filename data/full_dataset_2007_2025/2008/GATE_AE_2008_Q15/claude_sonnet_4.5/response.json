        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. 2, as the Mach number at the entry to the combustion chamber of a scramjet engine is typically around Mach 2. This is because scramjets are designed to operate at very high flight Mach numbers, typically above Mach 5, and the air entering the combustion chamber needs to be maintained at supersonic speeds to enable efficient supersonic combustion. Decelerating the flow to subsonic speeds before combustion would lead to excessive temperatures and pressures, causing dissociation and ionization, and reducing thrust. The retrieved knowledge from the video lectures and textbook notes consistently indicates that scramjets operate with a Mach number around 2 at the combustion chamber entry."
