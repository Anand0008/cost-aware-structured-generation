For efficient combustion and to prevent thermal choking, the Mach number at combustor entry is typically reduced from the flight Mach number (e.g., >5) but remains supersonic, commonly in the range of 1.5 to 3. Option C (2) falls within this typical range. Options A (0) and B (0.3) represent subsonic flow, characteristic of ramjets, not scramjets.
