        "reasoning": "The question is a linked MCQ, implying that the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) of the rocket is determined from a preceding question or context not provided here. The RAG context (Chunks 3 & 4) provides an example calculation for $\\Delta V$ (ideal burnout velocity from rest) using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. However, the specific values from that example (3233.5 m/s) do not directly lead to the given options when combined with the initial velocity.\n\nAssuming the question implies that the 'initial velocity of the liquid rocket engine' refers to the rocket's initial velocity ($V_0$) before the burn, and that a certain ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) has been achieved by the rocket engine, the final burnout velocity ($V_b$) is the sum of the initial velocity and this increment.\n\nGiven:\n*   Initial velocity of the rocket, $V_0 = 2.5 \\text{ km/s} = 2500 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   Neglecting gravity and drag effects (ideal conditions)\n\nLet the ideal velocity increment provided by the rocket engine be $\\Delta V$. The burnout velocity $V_b$ is then:\n$V_b = V_0 + \\Delta V$\n\nWorking backward from the correct answer (C. 10.2 km/s):\nIf $V_b = 10.2 \\text{ km/s} = 10200 \\text{ m/s}$\nThen, $10200 \\text{ m/s} = 2500 \\text{ m/s} + \\Delta V$\n$\\Delta V = 10200 - 2500 = 7700 \\text{ m/s} = 7.7 \\text{ km/s}$\n\nThis implies that the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) for this specific rocket, based on its mass ratio and exhaust velocity/specific impulse (which would have been provided in a preceding linked question), is $7.7 \\text{ km/s}$. The question then simply asks to add the given initial velocity to this increment.\n\nTherefore, the burnout velocity is $2.5 \\text{ km/s} + 7.7 \\text{ km/s} = 10.2 \\text{ km/s}$."

          "Step 1: Understand the context of a linked question. This question (Q75) likely follows a previous question (e.g., Q74) where the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) of the rocket was calculated using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, based on the rocket's mass ratio and specific impulse/exhaust velocity. The RAG context (Chunks 3 & 4) illustrates how to calculate this $\\Delta V$.",
          "Step 2: Identify the given information. The problem states an 'initial velocity of the liquid rocket engine' as $2.5 \\text{ km/s}$. In the context of rocket flight, this is interpreted as the rocket's initial velocity ($V_0$) at the start of the burn.",
          "Step 3: Recognize the assumption. The problem explicitly states 'Neglecting gravity and drag effects', which means we are dealing with an ideal scenario where the velocity increment is purely additive.",
          "Step 4: Formulate the relationship for burnout velocity. The burnout velocity ($V_b$) is the sum of the initial velocity ($V_0$) and the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) achieved by the rocket engine. The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation calculates this $\\Delta V$. So, $V_b = V_0 + \\Delta V$.",
          "Step 5: Infer the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$). Since the specific parameters (mass ratio, specific impulse) for this rocket are not provided in this standalone question, and it's a linked MCQ with a known correct answer, we infer the $\\Delta V$ that leads to the correct answer. Given $V_0 = 2.5 \\text{ km/s}$ and the correct answer $V_b = 10.2 \\text{ km/s}$, we can find $\\Delta V = V_b - V_0$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the burnout velocity. $\\Delta V = 10.2 \\text{ km/s} - 2.5 \\text{ km/s} = 7.7 \\text{ km/s}$. Then, $V_b = V_0 + \\Delta V = 2.5 \\text{ km/s} + 7.7 \\text{ km/s} = 10.2 \\text{ km/s}$."
