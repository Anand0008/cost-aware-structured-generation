        "reasoning": "The fin (vertical stabilizer) is the fixed part of the vertical tail. Its primary aerodynamic purpose is to provide directional (yaw) static stability, meaning it generates a yawing moment that tends to align the aircraft with the relative wind (weathervane effect). This is a fundamental concept in aircraft stability and is explicitly stated in the RAG context (Chunks 2, 3, 6). While the rudder (a movable part attached to the fin) provides yaw control, the question specifically asks about the 'fin'."
