        "reasoning": "The primary function of the vertical tail (or fin) in an aircraft is to provide directional stability, which allows the aircraft to maintain its heading and resist yawing motions. The vertical tail generates a restoring yawing moment when the aircraft experiences a sideslip, acting as a weathervane to keep the aircraft aligned with the relative wind. This directional stability is crucial for the aircraft's controllability and safe flight. The retrieved knowledge from the video and book notes confirms that the vertical tail's main role is to provide yaw stability, not yaw control (which is the function of the rudder), roll damping, or roll stability. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
