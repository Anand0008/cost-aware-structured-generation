        "reasoning": "The vertical tail, specifically its fixed part known as the fin, is the primary aerodynamic surface responsible for providing directional static stability to an aircraft. This is often referred to as the 'weathervane effect'. When an aircraft experiences a sideslip (a disturbance in yaw), the relative wind strikes the vertical fin, generating a side force. Because the fin is located aft of the aircraft's center of gravity (CG), this side force creates a yawing moment that acts to restore the aircraft to its original heading (zero sideslip). This inherent tendency to return to equilibrium in yaw is precisely what 'yaw stability' means. While the rudder, which is part of the vertical tail, provides 'yaw control' (active manipulation of yaw), the fin's fundamental and primary role is to provide the passive stability that makes the aircraft inherently stable in yaw. Options C and D (roll damping and roll stability) are primarily governed by other aircraft components like wings (dihedral, sweep) and horizontal tail, not the vertical fin."

          "Step 3: Define directional stability. Directional stability is the aircraft's inherent tendency to return to its original heading after being disturbed in yaw (rotation about the vertical axis).",
          "Step 4: Analyze how the vertical fin contributes to directional stability. When an aircraft sideslips (e.g., wind from the right, positive $\\beta$), the vertical fin experiences an angle of attack. This generates a side force on the fin. Since the fin is located behind the center of gravity, this side force creates a restoring yawing moment that turns the nose back into the wind, reducing the sideslip. This is known as the 'weathervane effect'.",
          "Step 5: Differentiate between stability and control. Stability is the passive, inherent tendency to return to equilibrium. Control is the active manipulation by the pilot (e.g., via rudder deflection). While the rudder (part of the vertical tail) provides yaw control, the fin itself primarily provides yaw stability.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the given options. Option B, 'yaw stability', directly corresponds to the primary function of the fin as described in Step 4. Options A (yaw control) is a secondary function enabled by the rudder on the fin. Options C and D (roll damping and roll stability) are functions primarily provided by other aircraft components like wings and horizontal tail."
