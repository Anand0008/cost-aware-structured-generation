        "notes": "RAG chunks provided detailed analysis of diffuser total pressure recovery and stagnation properties (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6), but did not explicitly give the adiabatic efficiency formula in terms of static pressure rise. They emphasized total pressure recovery factor (π_d = Pt2/Pt0). The question requires a different definition. Thus, internal knowledge was used to derive the correct formula and assumption (V2=0). RAG context was partially relevant but not directly applicable."
