Using the formulas and principles from the retrieved knowledge, the adiabatic efficiency can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the stagnation pressure at the diffuser inlet (P0a):\n   P0a = P0 * (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M0^2)^(gamma/(gamma-1))\n   P0a = 95 kPa * (1 + (1.4-1)/2 * 0.8^2)^(1.4/(1.4-1))\n   P0a = 95 kPa * 1.6 = 152 kPa\n\n2. The diffuser exit total pressure (P01) is given as 140 kPa.\n\n3. The adiabatic efficiency of the diffuser is defined as:\n   eta_d = P01 / P0a\n   eta_d = 140 kPa / 152 kPa = 0.915\n\nTherefore, the adiabatic efficiency of the intake (diffuser) is 0.915, which matches the correct answer option B."
