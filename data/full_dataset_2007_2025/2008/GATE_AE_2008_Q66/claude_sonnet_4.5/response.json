        "reasoning": "The shear force diagram for a beam with a concentrated bending moment M at mid-span should be a constant positive value of M/L on the left side of the mid-span, and a constant negative value of -M/L on the right side of the mid-span. This is because the concentrated moment causes a jump in the shear force, but the shear force is otherwise constant along the beam length. The diagram shown in option C matches this expected behavior, so it is the correct answer."

          "Since the moment M is concentrated at mid-span, the shear force V will be constant on either side of the mid-span, with a jump at the mid-span equal to the magnitude of the moment M.",
          "On the left side of mid-span, the shear force will be positive and equal to M/L, as the moment is trying to rotate the beam clockwise. On the right side of mid-span, the shear force will be negative and equal to -M/L, as the moment is trying to rotate the beam counterclockwise.",
