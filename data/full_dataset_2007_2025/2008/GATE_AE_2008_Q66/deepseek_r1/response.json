        "reasoning": "For a simply supported beam with only a concentrated bending moment M at mid-span (and no other transverse loads), the equilibrium conditions yield reaction forces that form a couple: R_A = M/L (upward) and R_B = -M/L (downward). The internal shear force V(x) is equal to the left reaction R_A for any section between the supports (0 < x < L), as there is no other vertical force to change it. Therefore, the shear force is constant and positive (assuming the standard sign convention: upward force on the left face of a section is positive). This matches option C (Constant positive). The RAG context (Chunk 2) explicitly confirms: 'The shear force diagram will be constant across the beam' and 'The lecturer states the shear is constant M/L throughout.'"

          "Step 1: Identify the beam configuration and loading. The beam is simply supported (common assumption for such diagrams) and carries a concentrated bending moment M at its mid-span. No other transverse loads are present.",
          "Step 2: Calculate the support reactions using equilibrium equations. Since only a moment is applied, the net vertical force from reactions must be zero. Taking moments about the right support B: \\sum M_B = 0 => R_A * L - M = 0, which gives R_A = M/L (upward). Vertical force equilibrium: \\sum F_y = 0 => R_A + R_B = 0, giving R_B = -M/L (downward). The reactions form a couple of magnitude M to balance the applied moment.",
          "Step 3: Determine the shear force function V(x). For a section at a distance x from the left support A (with 0 < x < L/2 and L/2 < x < L), the shear force is found by considering the left segment. There is no distributed load (w=0) and no point force between supports. Therefore, V(x) = R_A = M/L (constant) for the entire beam length, except exactly at the point of moment application where it is undefined but the constant value holds on either side. A concentrated moment does NOT cause a jump in the shear force diagram.",
          "Step 4: Conclude the shape of the shear force diagram (SFD). Since V(x) is a constant positive value (M/L) for all x, the SFD is a horizontal line (constant positive) above the x-axis. This corresponds to option C."

        "notes": "RAG chunk 2 (video_note - Beams - BMD and SFD) was highly relevant and directly provided the key concept: 'The shear force diagram will be constant across the beam' for a simply supported beam with a concentrated moment. Other chunks (1,3,5,6) discussed point loads and distributed loads, which were not directly applicable but provided useful context for beam analysis in general. The RAG context was sufficient to answer the question confidently."
