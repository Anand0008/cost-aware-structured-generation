        "reasoning": "The problem describes a simply supported beam of length `L` with a concentrated bending moment `M` applied at its mid-span. To determine the shear force diagram (SFD), we first need to calculate the support reactions.\n\nLet the left support be A (pin) and the right support be B (roller). Assume `R_A` and `R_B` are the vertical reactions at A and B, respectively, with upward as positive. The applied moment `M` is clockwise.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium of Vertical Forces:**\n    `$\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B = 0$`\n    Thus, `R_B = -R_A`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium of Moments about A:**\n    Taking counter-clockwise moments as positive:\n    `$\\sum M_A = 0 \\implies -M + R_B \\times L = 0$`\n    (The applied moment `M` is clockwise, hence negative in this convention).\n    `$R_B = \\frac{M}{L}$`\n\n3.  **Calculate R_A:**\n    From `R_A + R_B = 0`:\n    `$R_A = -R_B = -\\frac{M}{L}$`\n    So, `R_A` is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting downwards, and `R_B` is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting upwards.\n\n4.  **Determine Shear Force V(x):**\n    The shear force `V(x)` at any section `x` is the algebraic sum of the vertical forces to the left of that section. We use the standard sign convention where an upward force on the left section results in positive shear.\n\n    *   **For `0 < x < L/2` (left section, before the applied moment):**\n        The only vertical force to the left of the section is `R_A`, which is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting downwards.\n        `$V(x) = -R_A = -(-\\frac{M}{L}) = \\frac{M}{L}$` (constant positive shear).\n\n    *   **For `L/2 < x < L` (right section, after the applied moment):**\n        Again, the only vertical force to the left of the section is `R_A` (the concentrated moment `M` does not directly contribute to shear force).\n        `$V(x) = -R_A = -(-\\frac{M}{L}) = \\frac{M}{L}$` (constant positive shear).\n\n    Therefore, the shear force is constant and equal to `$\\frac{M}{L}$` throughout the entire length of the beam. This corresponds to Diagram C in the options, which shows a constant positive shear force of magnitude `$\\frac{M}{L}$`."

          "**Step 1: Understand the Beam and Loading.** Identify that it's a simply supported beam of total length `L` with a concentrated clockwise bending moment `M` applied exactly at its mid-span (`L/2`).",
          "**Step 2: Calculate Support Reactions.** Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) of the beam. Apply the equations of static equilibrium: `$\\sum F_y = 0$` (sum of vertical forces is zero) and `$\\sum M = 0$` (sum of moments about any point is zero). For a clockwise moment `M` at mid-span, the reactions will be `R_A = M/L` (downward) at the left support and `R_B = M/L` (upward) at the right support, forming a couple to balance `M`.",
          "**Step 3: Determine Shear Force Equation.** Consider a section `x` from the left support. The shear force `V(x)` at any point `x` is the algebraic sum of all vertical forces acting to the left of that section. Use a consistent sign convention (e.g., upward forces to the left of the cut are positive shear).",
          "**Step 4: Calculate Shear Force for Left Section.** For `0 < x < L/2` (before the applied moment), the only vertical force to the left is the downward reaction `R_A = M/L`. According to the chosen sign convention (upward on left is positive), a downward `R_A` results in a positive internal shear force `V(x) = M/L`.",
          "**Step 5: Calculate Shear Force for Right Section.** For `L/2 < x < L` (after the applied moment), the concentrated moment `M` does not directly contribute to the shear force. Therefore, the shear force remains `V(x) = M/L` (constant positive) in this section as well.",
          "**Step 6: Identify the Correct Diagram.** Since the shear force is constant and positive (`M/L`) throughout the entire beam, the shear force diagram will be a horizontal line above the x-axis. Compare this with the given options to find the matching diagram (Diagram C)."
