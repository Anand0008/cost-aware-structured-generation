        "reasoning": "The line integral `$\\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx)$` can be evaluated using Green's Theorem or by direct parameterization. Both methods yield the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using Green's Theorem**\nGreen's Theorem states that for a simple closed curve `C` enclosing a region `R`, and functions `P(x,y)` and `Q(x,y)` with continuous first-order partial derivatives:\n`$\\oint_C (P \\, dx + Q \\, dy) = \\iint_R \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\right) \\, dA$`\n\n1.  **Identify P and Q:** The given integral is `$\\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx)$`. To match the standard form, we rearrange it as `$\\oint_C (-y \\, dx + x \\, dy)$`. Therefore, `P = -y` and `Q = x`.\n2.  **Calculate Partial Derivatives:**\n    *   `$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x) = 1$`\n    *   `$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-y) = -1$`\n3.  **Apply Green's Theorem:**\n    `$\\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx) = \\iint_R (1 - (-1)) \\, dA = \\iint_R 2 \\, dA$`\n4.  **Evaluate the Double Integral:** The region `R` is a circle of unit radius (`r=1`) centered at the origin, as `C` is a circle of unit radius. The term `$\\iint_R dA$` represents the area of the region `R`. For a unit circle, the area is `$\\pi r^2 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$`.\n    So, `$\\iint_R 2 \\, dA = 2 \\times \\text{Area}(R) = 2 \\times \\pi = 2\\pi$`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for `$(1/2\\pi) \\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx)$`.\n    Substituting the calculated value: `$(1/2\\pi) \\times (2\\pi) = 1$`.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Parameterization (as shown in RAG CHUNK 3)**\n1.  **Parameterize the Curve C:** For a unit circle traversed anticlockwise, we can use `x = \\cos\\theta` and `y = \\sin\\theta`, where `$\\theta$` ranges from `0` to `$\\2\\pi$`.\n2.  **Find Differentials:**\n    *   `$dx = -\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$`\n    *   `$dy = \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$`\n3.  **Substitute into the Integral:**\n    `$\\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\cos\\theta (\\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta) - \\sin\\theta (-\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta))$`\n    `$= \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta$`\n4.  **Simplify and Integrate:** Using the identity `$\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$`:\n    `$= \\int_0^{2\\pi} 1 \\, d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi$`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for `$(1/2\\pi) \\oint_C (x \\, dy - y \\, dx)$`.\n    Substituting the calculated value: `$(1/2\\pi) \\times (2\\pi) = 1$`.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the value of the expression is 1."
