        "reasoning": "For a thin-walled tube of circular cross-section with a central web dividing it into two *symmetric* cells, subjected to a pure torque $M$, the shear flows $q_I$ and $q_{II}$ circulating in each cell must be equal in magnitude due to symmetry. Let $q_I$ be the shear flow in the upper cell and $q_{II}$ in the lower cell. The total torque $M$ is given by $M = 2 A_I q_I + 2 A_{II} q_{II}$. The compatibility condition (equal rate of twist for both cells) dictates that $q_I = q_{II}$ for symmetric cells under pure torsion. The shear flow in the central web is the superposition of the shear flows from Cell I and Cell II. If both $q_I$ and $q_{II}$ circulate in the same direction (e.g., clockwise to produce a clockwise torque $M$), then in the central web, the shear flow from Cell I acts in one direction (e.g., downwards) and the shear flow from Cell II acts in the opposite direction (e.g., upwards). Therefore, the net shear flow in the central web, $q_{web}$, is the difference between $q_I$ and $q_{II}$. Since $q_I = q_{II}$, the shear flow in the central web $q_{web}$ is zero."

        "question_nature": "Derivation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the system and loading.** The problem describes a thin-walled circular tube with mean radius $r$, divided into two symmetric cells by a central web. A pure torque $M$ is applied to this section. The goal is to find the shear flow $q$ in the central web.",
          "**Step 2: Recall principles for multi-cell sections under torsion.** For thin-walled closed sections subjected to torsion, Bredt-Batho theory is applied. For multi-cell sections, this involves two main conditions: (a) Torque equilibrium: The total applied torque is the sum of the torques carried by each cell ($M = \\sum 2 A_i q_i$). (b) Compatibility: The rate of twist ($d\\theta/dz$) must be the same for all cells ($(d\\theta/dz)_i = (d\\theta/dz)_j$).",
          "**Step 3: Define shear flows and cell areas.** Let $q_I$ be the circulating shear flow in the upper cell (Cell I) and $q_{II}$ be the circulating shear flow in the lower cell (Cell II). Due to the circular cross-section and central web, each cell is a semi-circular area. The area enclosed by each cell is $A_I = A_{II} = A = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2$.",
          "**Step 4: Apply compatibility condition for symmetric cells.** Since the two cells are symmetric in geometry and material properties, and the applied load is a pure torque, the resistance offered by each cell to twisting must be identical. This implies that the rate of twist for both cells must be equal. The compatibility equation for equal rates of twist, $(1 / (2A_I G)) \\oint_{Cell I} (q/t) ds = (1 / (2A_{II} G)) \\oint_{Cell II} (q/t) ds$, simplifies significantly for symmetric cells. Given $A_I = A_{II}$ and uniform shear modulus $G$, it means $\\oint_{Cell I} (q/t) ds = \\oint_{Cell II} (q/t) ds$. This condition, combined with the symmetric geometry and loading, leads to the conclusion that the circulating shear flows in the two cells must be equal in magnitude: $q_I = q_{II}$.",
          "**Step 5: Determine shear flow in the central web.** The central web is common to both cells. The shear flow in the web is the superposition of the circulating shear flows from Cell I and Cell II. If $q_I$ circulates clockwise in Cell I and $q_{II}$ circulates clockwise in Cell II (to produce a net clockwise torque $M$), then in the central web, $q_I$ acts in one direction (e.g., downwards) and $q_{II}$ acts in the opposite direction (e.g., upwards). Therefore, the net shear flow in the central web, $q_{web}$, is the difference between $q_I$ and $q_{II}$.",
          "**Step 6: Calculate $q_{web}$.** Since $q_I = q_{II}$, the net shear flow in the central web is $q_{web} = q_I - q_{II} = 0$."
