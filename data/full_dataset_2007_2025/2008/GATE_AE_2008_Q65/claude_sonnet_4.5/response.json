The question asks for the shear flow q in the central web when a torque M is acting on the section. \n\nFrom the given equations, option (B) q = 0 is the correct answer. This is because the central web divides the tube into two symmetric cells, and the shear flow in the central web will be zero due to the symmetry of the cross-section.
