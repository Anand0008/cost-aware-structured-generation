Due to symmetry of the two cells divided by the central web, the shear flows in the cells are equal and opposite in the central web. Therefore, the net shear flow in the central web cancels out, resulting in q=0. This is consistent with the principle that internal webs in symmetric multi-cell sections under pure torque have zero shear flow if the cells are identical and loading is symmetric."
