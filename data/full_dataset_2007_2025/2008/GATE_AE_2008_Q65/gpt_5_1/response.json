        "reasoning": "The cross-section is a thin-walled circular tube with a diametral web that divides it into two identical semicircular cells. The applied torque M is about the center, and the geometry and loading are perfectly symmetric. For thin-walled multi-cell closed sections under pure torque, the shear flow in each cell is uniform and the torque carried by each cell is T_i = 2 A_i q_i, where A_i is the cell area. Because the two cells are identical and the torque is applied through the centroid, equilibrium and compatibility (equal twist) require that the torque is shared equally: M = 2 A q_1 + 2 A q_2 with A_1 = A_2 = A. Symmetry then gives q_1 = q_2. The central web is common to both cells and experiences equal and opposite shear flows from the two cells, so the net shear flow in the web is q_web = q_1 - q_2 = 0. Physically, the diametral web lies along the torque axis and does not contribute to the torsional resistance in a perfectly symmetric circular tube; all torsional shear flow runs around the circular wall. Therefore the correct option is B: q = 0."
