        "reasoning": "The degree of reaction (R) is defined as the ratio of the static enthalpy (or pressure) drop in the rotor to the total static enthalpy (or pressure) drop across the entire turbine stage (stator + rotor). An impulse turbine is characterized by the fact that all the static enthalpy (or pressure) drop occurs in the stator (nozzle) and there is ideally no static enthalpy or pressure drop across the rotor blades. Therefore, the static enthalpy drop in the rotor is zero. According to the definition, if the numerator (static enthalpy drop in rotor) is zero, the degree of reaction (R) must be zero. This is consistently stated across multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (Chunk 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)."

In an ideal impulse turbine, the entire static enthalpy (or pressure) drop, and thus the acceleration of the fluid, occurs in the stationary nozzle (stator) before the fluid enters the rotor. The rotor blades are designed to change the direction of the high-velocity fluid jets without causing a significant static pressure drop across them.",
          "Step 3: Apply the definition of R to an impulse turbine. Since there is ideally no static enthalpy drop (or pressure drop) across the rotor in an impulse turbine, the numerator in the degree of reaction formula (static enthalpy drop in rotor) becomes zero.",
