A supercritical airfoil is specifically designed for transonic flight and is characterized by a relatively flat upper surface to reduce local supersonic flow acceleration, a rounded leading edge (common for subsonic airfoils to prevent flow separation), and a highly cambered aft section to compensate for lift lost due to the flat upper surface and to manage the pressure recovery. Options B, C, and D contain incorrect features like a sharp leading edge (typical of supersonic airfoils), a curved upper surface (characteristic of conventional airfoils), or no camber at the rear (contradicting the key design feature of a supercritical airfoil)."
