        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge consistently describes supercritical airfoils with specific geometrical features. Chunk 1 states: 'A supercritical airfoil is characterized by a relatively flat upper surface, a highly cambered aft section, and a distinct cusp near the trailing edge on the lower surface.' Chunk 2 reiterates: 'An airfoil designed with a distinct shape (often a flattened top and cambered aft section)'. Chunk 3, describing Figure 11.19, mentions the 'characteristic flat upper surface and more cambered rear section'. Chunk 4 also confirms: 'characterized by a relatively flat upper surface, especially over the forward section, and a more highly cambered aft section'. While a 'rounded leading edge' is a general feature of most airfoils (and not explicitly contradicted for supercritical airfoils, whose unique features are primarily on the upper and aft surfaces), the combination of 'flat upper surface' and 'high camber at the rear' is the defining characteristic of a supercritical airfoil, as highlighted in all relevant RAG chunks. Option A perfectly aligns with these descriptions. The other options contain incorrect features like 'sharp leading edge', 'curved upper surface' (for the main part), or 'no camber at the rear', which contradict the design principles of supercritical airfoils."

          "Step 2: Recall the characteristic geometrical features of a supercritical airfoil. The key features are a relatively flat upper surface, especially over the forward section, and a more highly cambered aft (rear) section (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the options provided. Look for the option that correctly combines these defining features.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option A: 'rounded leading edge, flat upper surface and high camber at the rear'. The 'flat upper surface' and 'high camber at the rear' are direct matches to the described characteristics. A 'rounded leading edge' is typical for most airfoils and not a distinguishing feature, but it is not incorrect for a supercritical airfoil.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate other options. Options B, C, and D contain incorrect features such as 'sharp leading edge', 'curved upper surface' (which is characteristic of conventional airfoils, not supercritical ones designed to flatten the pressure distribution), or 'no camber at the rear', all of which contradict the definition of a supercritical airfoil.",
