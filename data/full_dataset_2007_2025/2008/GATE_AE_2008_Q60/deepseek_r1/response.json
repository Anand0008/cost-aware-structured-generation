          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. The fuel-to-air ratio (f) in a combustor is determined by applying the steady-flow energy equation (First Law of Thermodynamics), assuming constant pressure combustion and constant specific heat.",
          "Step 2: Write the exact energy balance equation. The energy added by burning the fuel equals the enthalpy rise of the gas. For a control volume around the combustor: $\\dot{m}_a C_p T_{03} + \\dot{m}_f QR = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_p T_{04}$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is air mass flow, $\\dot{m}_f$ is fuel mass flow, $QR$ is heating value, and $C_p$ is specific heat.",
          "Step 3: Derive the formula for fuel-to-air ratio $f = \\dot{m}_f / \\dot{m}_a$. Divide the entire equation by $\\dot{m}_a$: $C_p T_{03} + f \\cdot QR = (1+f) C_p T_{04}$. Rearrange to solve for f: $f(QR - C_p T_{04}) = C_p (T_{04} - T_{03})$. Therefore, $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{04} - T_{03})}{QR - C_p T_{04}}$.",
          "Step 4: Ensure unit consistency. Convert all parameters to consistent SI units (Joules, kg, Kelvin): $C_p = 1.005 kJ/kg\\cdot K = 1005 J/kg\\cdot K$; $QR = 44 MJ/kg = 44 \\times 10^6 J/kg$; $T_{03} = 500 K$; $T_{04} = 1800 K$.",
          "Step 5: Perform the calculation. First, compute the numerator: $C_p (T_{04} - T_{03}) = 1005 \\times (1800 - 500) = 1005 \\times 1300 = 1,306,500 J/kg$. Next, compute the denominator: $QR - C_p T_{04} = 44 \\times 10^6 - (1005 \\times 1800) = 44,000,000 - 1,809,000 = 42,191,000 J/kg$. Finally, compute f: $f = 1,306,500 / 42,191,000 \\approx 0.03097$.",
          "Step 6: Interpret the result. $f \\approx 0.031$, which corresponds to option C. This means approximately 3.1 kg of fuel is required for every 100 kg of air."

Chunks 2, 3, and 5 (video notes) provided the exact formula and derivation for fuel-air ratio in a combustor, including example calculations with similar numbers. Chunk 1 provided foundational context on property assumptions. Chunks 4 and 6 were less directly relevant as they dealt with full cycle analysis and nozzle calculations. The RAG provided sufficient information to answer the question confidently."
