Using the energy balance equation for the combustor, and assuming constant specific heat capacity (Cp), the fuel-to-air ratio can be derived as:\n\n$f = \\frac{C_p (T_3 - T_2)}{QR - C_p T_3}$\n\nWhere:\n- $T_2 = 500 K$\n- $T_3 = 1800 K$ \n- $C_p = 1.005 kJ/kg-K$\n- $QR = 44 MJ/kg$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n$f = \\frac{1.005 \\times (1800 - 500)}{44 \\times 10^3 - 1.005 \\times 1800}$\n$f = 0.031$\n\nThis matches the correct answer option C.
