        "reasoning": "From the Airy stress function \\(\\phi(x,y) = -\\dfrac{P x y^3}{4c^3} + \\dfrac{3P x y}{4c}\\), we compute stresses using plane stress relations: \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial y^2\\), \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial x^2 = 0\\), and \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial x \\partial y\\). Differentiating: \\n\\(\\partial \\phi/\\partial y = -\\dfrac{3P x y^2}{4c^3} + \\dfrac{3P x}{4c}\\) \\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial y^2 = -\\dfrac{3P x y}{2c^3}\\). \\n\\(\\partial \\phi/\\partial x = -\\dfrac{P y^3}{4c^3} + \\dfrac{3P y}{4c}\\) \\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial x \\partial y = -\\left(-\\dfrac{3P y^2}{4c^3} + \\dfrac{3P}{4c}\\right) = \\dfrac{3P y^2}{4c^3} - \\dfrac{3P}{4c}.\\) \\nSo \\(\\tau_{xy}\\) is independent of \\(x\\): the shear stress distribution is the same at every cross-section along the beam. This corresponds to a constant internal shear force along the length, which is produced by a single end shear load with no distributed loading. Next, evaluate boundary tractions. On the top and bottom surfaces \\(y = \\pm c\\): \\nAt \\(y = c\\): \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\dfrac{3P c^2}{4c^3} - \\dfrac{3P}{4c} = 0\\). \\nAt \\(y = -c\\): \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\dfrac{3P c^2}{4c^3} - \\dfrac{3P}{4c} = 0\\). \\nThus the top and bottom are traction-free, as in a prismatic beam with no surface loads. On the end \\(x = 0\\): \\(\\sigma_x = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\dfrac{3P y^2}{4c^3} - \\dfrac{3P}{4c}\\). The shear traction varies parabolically over the depth and integrates to a resultant shear force \\(P\\) (this is the standard shear stress distribution in a rectangular section under shear force P). Therefore, the end \\(x=0\\) carries a shear load \\(P\\). On the other end \\(x=L\\), the same internal stress state exists but the boundary is clamped (zero displacement and rotation), not free; the Airy function describes internal stresses, not directly the displacement boundary. The only configuration consistent with: (i) plane stress, (ii) no distributed load, (iii) a single shear load \\(P\\) applied at one end, and (iv) the other end fixed, is a cantilever clamped at \\(x=L\\) with a shear load \\(P\\) at \\(x=0\\).
