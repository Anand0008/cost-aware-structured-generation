        "reasoning": "The problem provides an Airy stress function `$\\phi(x, y)$` and asks to identify the corresponding loading condition for a beam. The solution involves calculating the stress components `$\\sigma_x$`, `$\\sigma_y$`, and `$\\tau_{xy}$` from the given Airy function, and then relating these stresses to the internal bending moment `M(x)` and shear force `V(x)` using elementary beam theory. Finally, the derived `M(x)` and `V(x)` are used to deduce the boundary conditions and applied loads.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate stress components from the Airy stress function.**\nGiven `$\\phi(x, y) = -\\frac{Pxy^3}{4c^3} + \\frac{3Pxy}{4c}$`\n\n1.  **Normal stress `$\\sigma_x$`:**\n    `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`\n    First derivative with respect to `y`:\n    `$\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{P x (3y^2)}{4c^3} + \\frac{3Px}{4c} = -\\frac{3Pxy^2}{4c^3} + \\frac{3Px}{4c}$`\n    Second derivative with respect to `y`:\n    `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{3Px (2y)}{4c^3} = -\\frac{6Pxy}{4c^3} = -\\frac{3Pxy}{2c^3}$`\n\n2.  **Normal stress `$\\sigma_y$`:**\n    `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`\n    First derivative with respect to `x`:\n    `$\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{Py^3}{4c^3} + \\frac{3Py}{4c}$`\n    Second derivative with respect to `x`:\n    `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2} = 0$`\n    (This is consistent with the assumption of plane stress and negligible transverse normal stress in slender beams under bending.)\n\n3.  **Shear stress `$\\tau_{xy}$`:**\n    `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`\n    We already have `$\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{3Pxy^2}{4c^3} + \\frac{3Px}{4c}$`\n    Now, differentiate with respect to `x`:\n    `$\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{3Py^2}{4c^3} + \\frac{3P}{4c}$`\n    Therefore,\n    `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\left( -\\frac{3Py^2}{4c^3} + \\frac{3P}{4c} \\right) = \\frac{3Py^2}{4c^3} - \\frac{3P}{4c} = \\frac{3P}{4c^3}(y^2 - c^2)$`\n\n**Step 2: Relate stresses to bending moment `M(x)` and shear force `V(x)` using beam theory.**\n\nThe beam has a rectangular cross-section with depth `2c` (from `y=-c` to `y=c`) and thickness `b = 0.5 - (-0.5) = 1` (from the given region `$-0.5 \\le z \\le 0.5$`).\n\n1.  **Bending Moment `M(x)` from `$\\sigma_x$`:**\n    From elementary beam theory, `$\\sigma_x = -\\frac{M(x)y}{I}$` (using the convention where positive `M` causes tension in positive `y` direction, and `y` is upward from neutral axis. If `y` is downward as in the image, then `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{M(x)y}{I}$` for positive `M` causing tension below neutral axis). Let's use the standard `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{M(x)y}{I}$` where `y` is measured from the neutral axis, positive upwards. The image shows `y` downwards, so we must be careful with the sign. However, the form `$\\sigma_x = Cxy$` suggests `M(x)` is linear in `x`.\n    Let's use the convention `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{M(x)y}{I}$` where `y` is positive downwards as per the diagram. Then positive `M` (sagging) would cause tension for positive `y` (below neutral axis).\n    Moment of inertia `I = \\frac{b(2c)^3}{12} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 8c^3}{12} = \\frac{2c^3}{3}$`.\n    We have `$\\sigma_x = -\\frac{3Pxy}{2c^3}$`.\n    Comparing this with `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{M(x)y}{I} = \\frac{M(x)y}{(2c^3)/3} = \\frac{3M(x)y}{2c^3}$`:\n    `$-\\frac{3Pxy}{2c^3} = \\frac{3M(x)y}{2c^3}$`\n    This implies `M(x) = -Px`.\n\n2.  **Shear Force `V(x)` from `M(x)`:**\n    `$V(x) = \\frac{dM}{dx} = \\frac{d(-Px)}{dx} = -P$`\n\n3.  **Verify `V(x)` with `$\\tau_{xy}$`:**\n    From elementary beam theory, `$\\tau_{xy} = \\frac{VQ}{Ib}$`.\n    First moment of area `Q = \\int_y^c y' b dy' = b \\left[ \\frac{y'^2}{2} \\right]_y^c = \\frac{b}{2}(c^2 - y^2)$`.\n    With `b=1`, `Q = \\frac{1}{2}(c^2 - y^2)$`.\n    `$\\tau_{xy} = \\frac{V(x) Q}{Ib} = \\frac{(-P) \\frac{1}{2}(c^2 - y^2)}{(\\frac{2c^3}{3}) \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-P(c^2 - y^2)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2c^3} = \\frac{-3P(c^2 - y^2)}{4c^3} = \\frac{3P(y^2 - c^2)}{4c^3}$`\n    This matches the `$\\tau_{xy}$` derived from the Airy function, confirming `V(x) = -P`.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret `M(x)` and `V(x)` to identify the loading condition.**\n\nWe have `M(x) = -Px` and `V(x) = -P` for `0 \\le x \\le L`.\n\n*   **At `x=0`:**\n    `M(0) = -P(0) = 0`. This indicates a free end or a simply supported end (no moment restraint).\n    `V(0) = -P`. This indicates a downward shear force (point load) of magnitude `P` at `x=0`.\n\n*   **At `x=L`:**\n    `M(L) = -PL`. This indicates a non-zero bending moment, which must be provided by a fixed support.\n    `V(L) = -P`. This indicates the shear force is constant throughout the beam, implying no distributed load.\n\nCombining these, the beam has a zero moment and a downward shear load `P` at `x=0`, and a non-zero moment and shear force at `x=L`. This configuration is characteristic of a cantilever beam fixed at `x=L` and subjected to a downward point load `P` at its free end `x=0`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A. simply supported beam carrying a point load P at mid span: Incorrect. `M(x)` and `V(x)` would be different (triangular `M`, piecewise constant `V`).\n*   B. simply supported beam carrying a uniform distributed load of intensity P per unit length: Incorrect. `M(x)` would be parabolic, `V(x)` would be linear.\n*   C. cantilever beam clamped at end `x = L` and carrying a shear load `P` at `x = 0`: This matches our derivation. A downward load `P` at `x=0` on a cantilever fixed at `x=L` would produce `M(x) = -Px` and `V(x) = -P` (assuming `x` is measured from the free end `x=0`).\n*   D. cantilever beam clamped at end `x = 0` and carrying a shear load `P` at `x = L`: Incorrect. For this case, `M(x) = -P(L-x)` and `V(x) = -P` (if `x` is measured from the fixed end `x=0`). This `M(x)` is `Px - PL`, which is different from `M(x) = -Px`."
