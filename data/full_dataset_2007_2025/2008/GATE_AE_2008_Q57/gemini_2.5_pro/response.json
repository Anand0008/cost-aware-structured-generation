        "reasoning": "The thrust per unit mass flow rate for a jet engine is given by the difference between the exhaust velocity and the flight velocity, assuming the exit pressure equals ambient pressure (perfectly expanded nozzle).\n\n1.  **Thrust Equation:** For a perfectly expanded nozzle ($p_e = p_a$), the thrust per unit mass flow rate is:\n    $F/\\dot{m} = V_e - V_a$\n    where $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity and $V_a$ is the flight velocity.\n\n2.  **Velocity in terms of Mach number and temperature:** The velocity of a gas can be expressed as $V = M \\times a$, where $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$ is the speed of sound. Thus, $V = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$.\n\n3.  **Flight Velocity ($V_a$):** The flight Mach number is $M$, and the ambient static temperature is $T_a$. Therefore,\n    $V_a = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$\n\n4.  **Exhaust Velocity ($V_e$):** For an ideal ramjet with a perfectly expanded nozzle ($p_e = p_a$), the exhaust Mach number ($M_e$) is equal to the flight Mach number ($M$) (as stated in RAG Chunk 3). The exhaust static temperature is $T_e$. Therefore,\n    $V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$\n\n5.  **Substitute into Thrust Equation:** Substitute the expressions for $V_e$ and $V_a$ into the thrust equation:\n    $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} - M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$\n\n6.  **Factor and Simplify:** Factor out common terms $M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$:\n    $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}} - 1 \\right)$\n    $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{T_a}} - 1 \\right)$\n\nThis matches option C."

Gas constant R and specific heat ratio γ do not vary through the ramjet. Assuming that nozzle exhaust static pressure is equal to the ambient pressure and fuel air ratio f << 1, the thrust per unit mass flow rate is"
