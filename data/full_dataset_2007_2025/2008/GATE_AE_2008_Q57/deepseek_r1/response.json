    "question_text": "An ideal ramjet engine is flying at a Mach number M. The exhaust gas static temperature at the outlet of the nozzle is T_e. The ambient static temperature is T_a. Gas constant R and specific heat ratio γ do not vary through the ramjet. Assuming that nozzle exhaust static pressure is equal to the ambient pressure and fuel air ratio f << 1, the thrust per unit mass flow rate is"
