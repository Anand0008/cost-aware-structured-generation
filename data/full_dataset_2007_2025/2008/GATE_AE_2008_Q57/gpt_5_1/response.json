The flight (inlet) velocity is V_0 = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}. At the nozzle exit, for an ideal ramjet with M_e = M_0 (from ideal isentropic relations) and constant \\gamma, R, we have V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}. Therefore, \\frac{F}{\\dot{m}} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} - M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{T_a}} - 1 \\right). This matches option C.

Rathakrishnan's worked example (chunk 6) reinforced the use of isentropic relations and temperature changes in ramjets. Internal knowledge was used mainly to tailor the derivation to the exact GATE question format."
