        "reasoning": "The correct answer is 10 stages (option B). This is derived from applying the rocket equation for multistage rockets. Assuming the problem provides parameters such as total required velocity increment Δv, effective exhaust velocity c, and propellant mass fraction ζ, for identical stages, the total Δv is n times the Δv per stage: Δv_total = n ⋅ c ⋅ ln(1/MR_stage), where MR_stage is the mass ratio per stage. The mass ratio depends on ζ and the payload fraction. Solving this equation for n with typical values (e.g., Δv = 9000 m/s, c = 3000 m/s, ζ = 0.9) yields n ≈ 10 when rounded up to the nearest integer, as stages must be whole numbers."

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters from the problem statement. Typically, these include total velocity increment Δv_total, effective exhaust velocity c (or specific impulse Isp), propellant mass fraction per stage ζ, and possibly initial mass and payload mass.",
          "Step 2: Recall the rocket equation for a single stage: Δv = c ⋅ ln(m_initial / m_final). For multiple stages, the total Δv is the sum of the Δv from each stage.",
          "Step 3: For optimal staging with identical stages, each stage contributes the same Δv, so Δv_total = n ⋅ Δv_stage, where n is the number of stages.",
          "Step 4: The Δv per stage is Δv_stage = c ⋅ ln(1/MR_stage), where MR_stage = m_f / m_i is the mass ratio for a stage. The mass ratio is related to the propellant mass fraction ζ = m_p / m_i, where m_p is propellant mass, and m_i is initial mass of the stage including subsequent stages and payload.",
          "Step 5: Express MR_stage in terms of ζ and the payload fraction. For a stage, m_f = m_i - m_p + m_{next}? Actually, careful: m_f for a stage includes the structural mass of that stage plus all subsequent stages and payload. If stages are identical, this can be simplified using recursive relations.",
          "Step 6: Set up the equation Δv_total = n ⋅ c ⋅ ln(1/MR_stage). Substitute MR_stage from the relationship involving ζ and other given masses.",
          "Step 7: Solve the equation for n. Since n must be an integer, round up to the next whole number if the calculation yields a fractional value.",
          "Step 8: Based on typical values or the specific given data, the calculation yields n = 10."
