The optimal design has equal mass ratios for each stage.\n\nUsing the formula for the velocity increment of an n-stage rocket:\nΔv_f = n * c * ln(1/MR_stage)\nWhere MR_stage is the mass ratio of each stage.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n5,500 = 3 * 3,300 * ln(1/MR_stage)\nSolving for MR_stage, we get:\nMR_stage = 1.7428\n\nThis means the total mass ratio of the three-stage rocket is (1.7428)^3 = 10.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, 10 stages."
