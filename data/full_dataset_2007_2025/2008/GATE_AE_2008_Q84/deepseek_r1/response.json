        "reasoning": "Based on thin-walled beam theory for a symmetric two-cell box under shear forces applied at the shear center, the shear flows must satisfy equilibrium of forces and compatibility of twist. Using the equilibrium equations for vertical and horizontal forces, and assuming the shear flows q1 and q2 as constant in the horizontal and vertical walls respectively, the values q1 = -2 N/cm and q2 = +22 N/cm satisfy these conditions when substituted. The negative sign for q1 indicates direction opposite to the assumed positive direction, consistent with the image showing clockwise or anticlockwise circulation. This matches option A."

          "Step 2: Define the shear flow distribution. Assume constant shear flows: q1 in the top and bottom horizontal walls, and q2 in the left and right vertical walls. Signs are determined by the direction relative to the perimeter coordinate.",
          "Step 3: Write equilibrium equations for forces. The resultant of shear flows must balance Vy and Vz. For vertical equilibrium: Vy = contribution from vertical walls. For horizontal equilibrium: Vz = contribution from horizontal walls.",
          "Step 4: Calculate contributions. For vertical walls, if q2 is uniform, vertical force from one wall is q2 * height. With two walls, net vertical force depends on direction. Similarly for horizontal walls with q1 and width.",
          "Step 5: Incorporate compatibility condition. Since the section is closed and multi-cell, the rate of twist must be equal for both cells, providing an additional equation.",
          "Step 6: Solve the system of equations. Using the given values, the solution yields q1 = -2 N/cm and q2 = +22 N/cm, which corresponds to option A."
