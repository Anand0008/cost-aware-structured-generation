        "reasoning": "The question asks for the shear flows q1 and q2. The image description for the linked question (Q.85) explicitly states that the shear flows q1 and q2 are given as part of the options for Q.84. The options for Q.84 directly provide values for q1 and q2. Since this is a linked question, the values of q1 and q2 are meant to be used to calculate the torque M in Q.85. The question itself is asking to identify the correct pair of q1 and q2 from the given options. Without further information or a method to derive q1 and q2 from the applied forces (Vy, Vz, M), the question implies that one of the options for q1 and q2 is the correct set that leads to the correct M in Q.85, or that these are simply the given shear flows for the problem statement. Given that Q.84 asks 'The shear flows q1 and q2 are', and provides options, it's asking to select the correct values. The provided solution states 'A' is the correct answer. Therefore, q1 = -2 N/cm and q2 = +22 N/cm are the correct shear flows as per the answer key."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem statement. The problem describes a two-cell symmetric box beam subjected to shear forces and a torque. The question asks to identify the shear flows `q_1` and `q_2` from the given options.",
          "Step 2: Recognize that this question (Q.84) is linked to Q.85, which asks for the torque `M`. Often in linked questions, the answer to the first part is a prerequisite for the second, or the first part asks to identify given parameters. In this specific case, the question 'The shear flows q1 and q2 are' with options providing values for q1 and q2 suggests that these are the shear flows resulting from the applied loads, and we need to pick the correct set.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the image for the given shear flow directions and magnitudes. The image shows: \n- Top wall of Cell I: `q_1` (left to right)\n- Top wall of Cell II: 2 N/cm (left to right)\n- Bottom wall of Cell I: 22 N/cm (right to left)\n- Bottom wall of Cell II: 22 N/cm (right to left)\n- Left vertical wall of Cell I: 2 N/cm (downwards)\n- Right vertical wall of Cell II: `q_2` (downwards)\n- Common internal web: 10 N/cm (upwards)",
          "Step 4: Compare the labeled shear flows in the diagram with the options provided for `q_1` and `q_2`. The diagram explicitly labels the shear flow in the top wall of Cell II as '2 N/cm' and the shear flow in the right vertical wall of Cell II as 'q2'. The shear flow in the left vertical wall of Cell I is '2 N/cm' and the shear flow in the top wall of Cell I is 'q1'. The direction of `q_1` is shown as left-to-right, and the direction of `q_2` is shown as downwards.",
          "Step 5: Re-evaluate the question and image. The question asks for 'The shear flows q1 and q2 are'. The image shows `q_1` as the shear flow in the top skin of the left cell, and `q_2` as the shear flow in the right skin of the right cell. However, the image also shows specific numerical values for other walls: 2 N/cm for the top skin of the right cell, 2 N/cm for the left skin of the left cell, 22 N/cm for the bottom skins of both cells, and 10 N/cm for the central web. This implies that `q_1` and `q_2` are *not* the values explicitly given in the diagram (like 2 N/cm or 22 N/cm) but rather variables whose values are to be determined or selected from the options. The options for Q.84 provide specific values for `q_1` and `q_2`.",
          "Step 6: Given that this is a multiple-choice question and the answer key states 'A', we accept `q_1 = -2 N/cm` and `q_2 = +22 N/cm` as the correct values. The negative sign for `q_1` implies its actual direction is opposite to the arrow shown in the diagram (i.e., right to left). The positive sign for `q_2` implies its actual direction is the same as the arrow shown (i.e., downwards). This interpretation is consistent with how shear flows are typically represented, where a positive value means flow in the assumed direction and a negative value means flow in the opposite direction."
