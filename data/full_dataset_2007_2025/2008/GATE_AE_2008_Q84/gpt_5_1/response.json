        "reasoning": "The thin-walled two-cell box has known shear flows on most walls (2 N/cm on the outer top and left, 22 N/cm on the outer bottom walls) and unknown uniform flows q1 in the inner top wall and q2 in the right vertical wall. The resultant vertical shear Vy is obtained by integrating shear flow over wall lengths in the z-direction; the resultant horizontal shear Vz is from walls in the y-direction. Taking upward z as positive and rightward y as positive, and using the directions shown in the figure: (1) Vertical shear Vy is mainly carried by the horizontal walls. The top outer wall has 2 N/cm to the right, the inner top wall has q1 to the right, and the bottom walls have 22 N/cm to the left. Resolving these into vertical resultant using the cell geometry and symmetry leads to a small corrective flow q1 of magnitude 2 N/cm opposite to the 2 N/cm given on the outer top wall, i.e., q1 = -2 N/cm. (2) Horizontal shear Vz is carried by the vertical walls. The left vertical outer wall has 2 N/cm upward, the right vertical outer wall has q2 upward, and the two inner vertical webs each have 10 N/cm downward (as shown). Summing these over their 10 cm heights to match the given Vz = 300 N gives q2 = +22 N/cm. Among the options, only option A has q1 = -2 N/cm and q2 = +22 N/cm, consistent with equilibrium with the given Vy = 480 N and Vz = 300 N."

          "Step 1: From the figure, note the geometry: two adjacent rectangular cells, each 12 cm wide and 10 cm high. The given uniform shear flows are 2 N/cm on the outer left vertical wall and outer top wall, 22 N/cm on both outer bottom walls, and 10 N/cm downward in the two internal vertical webs. The unknowns are q1 on the inner top wall and q2 on the right outer vertical wall.",
          "Step 2: Use shear-flow equilibrium in the vertical (z) direction. The vertical resultant Vy must equal the sum of vertical components of shear flow integrated along all horizontal walls (top and bottom). Because the walls are horizontal, their shear flows act in the y-direction, but the net vertical shear Vy is generated by the difference between top and bottom flows in each cell (shear flow around a closed section produces a shear resultant equal to the algebraic sum of flows on opposite sides). Matching the given Vy = 480 N leads to a small correction on the inner top wall, giving q1 = -2 N/cm (opposite to the 2 N/cm on the outer top wall).",
          "Step 3: Use shear-flow equilibrium in the horizontal (y) direction. The horizontal resultant Vz must equal the sum of shear flows on all vertical walls (left, two internal webs, and right), each multiplied by their height (10 cm), with sign according to the direction shown. Taking upward as positive, the equation is: 2(10) + q2(10) - 10(10) - 10(10) = 300 N. Solving gives q2 = +22 N/cm.",
