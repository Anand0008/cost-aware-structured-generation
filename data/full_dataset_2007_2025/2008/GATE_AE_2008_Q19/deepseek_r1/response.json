        "reasoning": "Compatibility conditions in elasticity are mathematical constraints on the strain field. They are derived by eliminating the displacements from the strain-displacement relations to ensure that a given set of strains corresponds to a physically possible, continuous deformation without gaps, tears, or overlaps. This directly ensures that the displacement field obtained by integrating the strains is single-valued and continuous. This definition is explicitly stated in RAG chunks 3, 5, and 6. Option A confuses compatibility with equilibrium or constitutive relations. Option B describes the constitutive law itself (Hooke's Law). Option D describes a condition (biharmonic equation) that arises in specific stress-function methods (e.g., Airy's stress function) for solving equilibrium and compatibility together, but it is not the primary purpose of compatibility conditions."
