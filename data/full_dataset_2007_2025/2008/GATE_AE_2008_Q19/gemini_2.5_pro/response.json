Their fundamental purpose is to ensure that the calculated strain field corresponds to a physically possible deformation. This means that the displacement field (u, v, w) derived from these strains is continuous and single-valued throughout the body, without any internal voids, overlaps, or tearing. This concept is explicitly stated in RAG chunks 3, 5, and 6. Option A is incorrect as compatibility is about strains and displacements, not direct compatibility between various stresses. Option B describes constitutive relations (stress-strain laws), which are distinct from compatibility conditions. Option D refers to the bi-harmonic equation, which arises when compatibility and equilibrium equations are combined and expressed in terms of a stress function (like Airy's stress function) for 2D problems, but it is a consequence, not the primary purpose, of compatibility conditions."
