        "reasoning": "The escape velocity ($u_e$) from a celestial body is derived from the principle of conservation of energy, equating the initial kinetic energy to the work required to overcome gravity from the initial position to infinity. The general formula for escape velocity is given by $u_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{R}}$, where $\\mu$ is the gravitational parameter of the central body (Earth in this case, $\\mu = G M_{Earth}$) and $R$ is the distance from the center of the central body to the spacecraft. This formula clearly shows that escape velocity depends on the gravitational parameter of the Earth (which includes Earth's mass) and the distance from Earth's center to the spacecraft. It does NOT depend on the mass of the spacecraft, as the spacecraft's mass cancels out during the derivation. Earth's rotational speed and orbital speed are not direct factors in the fundamental definition of escape velocity, though they can affect the effective velocity required from a launch site."

Option B (distance between Earth's center and the spacecraft) is correct because $R$ is directly in the formula. Options C (Earth's rotational speed) and D (Earth's orbital speed) are incorrect as they are not fundamental parameters in the escape velocity formula itself, although Earth's rotation can provide an initial velocity boost for launches."
