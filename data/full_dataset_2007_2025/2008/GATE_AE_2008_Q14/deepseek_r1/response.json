However, according to standard propulsion textbooks (e.g., Sutton's Rocket Propulsion Elements) and retrieved knowledge from video lectures (Chunks 1, 3, 4), the wall heat flux in a rocket nozzle is maximum at the throat due to peak convective heat transfer coefficient and adiabatic wall temperature. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the answer key or a specific context for this question. For learning, students should understand that typically the throat experiences maximum heat flux."
