        "reasoning": "Based on fundamental principles of rocket propulsion and heat transfer, the maximum wall heat flux in a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle occurs at the **throat** (Option C). This is due to a critical combination of factors:\n1.  **Highest Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (h):** At the nozzle throat, the hot combustion gases accelerate to sonic velocity (Mach 1). This high velocity, coupled with a rapidly thinning boundary layer, leads to the maximum convective heat transfer coefficient `h` in the entire nozzle.\n2.  **High Adiabatic Wall Temperature (T_aw):** While the absolute gas temperature is highest in the combustion chamber, it remains very high at the throat, contributing to a significant temperature difference for heat transfer.\n\nThe local heat flux `q_dot''` is given by the formula: `$q_dot'' = h \\times (T_{aw} - T_w)$`. Since `h` reaches its peak at the throat, and `T_aw` is still very high, the product `q_dot''` is maximized in this region. This is explicitly supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, 3, 4), which states: \"In a rocket nozzle, the heat flux from the hot combustion gases to the engine wall is not uniform. It reaches a maximum value precisely at the nozzle throat.\" and \"The convective heat flux... is highest at the nozzle throat and decreases towards both the convergent and divergent sections.\"\n\nTherefore, based on established physics and the provided RAG context, option C (the throat of the CD nozzle) is the physically correct answer. However, the provided answer key states B (the entry to the convergent portion of the CD nozzle) as the correct answer. If 'entry to the convergent portion' refers to the combustion chamber exit, while gas temperature is highest there, the convective heat transfer coefficient `h` is significantly lower than at the throat due to lower velocities and thicker boundary layers, resulting in a lower overall heat flux compared to the throat. As per instructions, the provided answer key (B) is validated as 'correct' despite this physical discrepancy."

          "Step 3: Analyze the variation of gas properties and the heat transfer coefficient along the nozzle. In the combustion chamber and the entry to the convergent section, the gas temperature (`T_aw`) is highest, but the gas velocity is relatively low, leading to a thicker boundary layer and a lower `h`.",
          "Step 4: Consider the nozzle throat. At this point, the flow accelerates to sonic velocity (Mach 1). This high velocity and the resulting very thin boundary layer cause the convective heat transfer coefficient `h` to reach its maximum value. The gas temperature (`T_aw`) is still very high at the throat.",
          "Step 5: In the divergent section, the flow continues to accelerate to supersonic speeds, but the gas temperature (`T_aw`) decreases significantly due to expansion. Although velocity is high, the boundary layer can thicken slightly, and the decreasing `T_aw` leads to a reduction in overall heat flux compared to the throat.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that the combination of the maximum `h` and high `T_aw` results in the maximum wall heat flux occurring precisely at the nozzle throat (Option C), as supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 3, 4)."
