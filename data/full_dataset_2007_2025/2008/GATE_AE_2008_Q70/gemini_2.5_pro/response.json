        "reasoning": "The governing equation for flexural vibration of a uniform slender beam is given as `$$EI \\frac{\\partial^4 w}{\\partial x^4} + \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} = 0$$`. For free vibration, we assume a solution of the form `$$w(x,t) = \\phi(x) T(t)$$`. Substituting this into the equation and separating variables leads to the spatial eigenvalue problem: `$$EI \\phi''''(x) - \\rho A \\omega^2 \\phi(x) = 0$$`, where `$\\omega$` is the natural angular frequency. The question provides the fundamental mode shape as `$$\\phi(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$`. We need to find its fourth derivative: \\n1. `$$\\phi'(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$` \\n2. `$$\\phi''(x) = -\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$` \\n3. `$$\\phi'''(x) = -\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$` \\n4. `$$\\phi''''(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$` \\nSubstitute `$\\phi(x)$` and `$\\phi''''(x)$` back into the spatial eigenvalue problem: `$$EI \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\rho A \\omega^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = 0$$`. Since `$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$` is not identically zero, we can divide the equation by it: `$$EI \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 - \\rho A \\omega^2 = 0$$`. Solving for `$\\omega^2$`: `$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{EI}{\\rho A} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4$$`. Taking the square root to find the natural frequency `$\\omega$`: `$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$$`. This can be rewritten as `$$\\omega = \\pi^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A L^4}}$$`. This result matches option B."
