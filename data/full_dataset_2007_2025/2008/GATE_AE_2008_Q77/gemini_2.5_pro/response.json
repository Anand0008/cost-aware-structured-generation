        "reasoning": "The question asks for the percentage error in estimating the integral $\\int_0^1 x^3 dx$ using Simpson's rule. \\n\\n1.  **Exact Solution:** The exact value of the integral is:\\n    $\\int_0^1 x^3 dx = \\left[\\frac{x^4}{4}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1^4}{4} - \\frac{0^4}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\\n\\n2.  **Simpson's 1/3 Rule Error Property:** Simpson's 1/3 rule approximates the function with a quadratic polynomial. However, due to the symmetric nature of the integration interval, the error term associated with the third derivative vanishes (as shown in RAG chunks 2 and 4). The leading error term for Simpson's 1/3 rule is given by $E_{Simpson\\_1/3} = -\\frac{h^5}{90} f^{(4)}(\\zeta)$, where $h$ is the step size and $f^{(4)}(\\zeta)$ is the fourth derivative of the function $f(x)$ evaluated at some point $\\zeta$ within the interval (RAG chunks 1 and 3). \\n\\n3.  **Applying to the given function:** The integrand is $f(x) = x^3$. Let's find its derivatives:\\n    $f'(x) = 3x^2$\\n    $f''(x) = 6x$\\n    $f'''(x) = 6$\\n    $f^{(4)}(x) = 0$\\n\\n4.  **Error Calculation:** Since the fourth derivative $f^{(4)}(x)$ is identically zero for $f(x) = x^3$, the error term for Simpson's 1/3 rule becomes $E_{Simpson\\_1/3} = -\\frac{h^5}{90} \\times 0 = 0$. This means Simpson's 1/3 rule provides an exact result for any cubic polynomial.\\n\\n5.  **Percentage Error:** Since the error is 0, the numerical estimation will be exactly equal to the exact solution. Therefore, the percentage error is $\\frac{|0.25 - 0.25|}{0.25} \\times 100\\% = 0\\%$. \\n\\nThus, option D is the correct answer."
