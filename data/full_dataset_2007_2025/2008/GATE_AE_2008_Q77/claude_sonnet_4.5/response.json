The exact value of this integral is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nSimpson's 1/3 rule is an $O(h^{4})$ accurate method, meaning the error is proportional to $h^{4}$, where $h$ is the step size. For an even number of subintervals, the error formula is given by:\n\n$E_{Simpson} = -\\frac{h^{5}}{90}f^{(4)}(\\zeta)$\n\nIn this case, with $a=0$, $b=1$, and $f(x) = x^{3}$, we have:\n$f^{(4)}(x) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the error is exactly zero, and the Simpson's rule solution is the exact value of $\\frac{1}{4}$. This matches the correct answer of D (0%)."
