The airspeed indicator measures dynamic pressure and is calibrated assuming standard sea-level density, so indicated airspeed (IAS) equals equivalent airspeed (EAS) when instrument and position errors and compressibility are neglected. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is IAS corrected for instrument and position errors; with those errors assumed zero, CAS = IAS. True airspeed (TAS) is related to EAS by $V_{\\text{TAS}} = V_{\\text{EAS}} \\sqrt{\\rho_{SL}/\\rho}$, so at altitude where $\\rho < \\rho_{SL}$, $V_{\\text{TAS}} > V_{\\text{EAS}}$. Therefore: (A) TAS > 250 km/h is true; (B) CAS = 250 km/h is true; (D) EAS = 250 km/h is true; (C) TAS = 250 km/h is false. Hence option C is the false statement, matching the official key."

          "Step 2: Use the assumptions. The problem states no instrument or position errors and neglects compressibility. Therefore, IAS = CAS and, for subsonic speeds, IAS \\approx EAS.",

This gives $V_{\\text{TAS}} = V_{\\text{EAS}} \\sqrt{\\rho_{SL}/\\rho}$. At 5000 m, $\\rho < \\rho_{SL}$, so $\\sqrt{\\rho_{SL}/\\rho} > 1$, implying $V_{\\text{TAS}} > V_{\\text{EAS}}$.",
