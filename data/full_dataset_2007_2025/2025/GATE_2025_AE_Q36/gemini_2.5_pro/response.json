        "reasoning": "The total lift ($L$) and induced drag ($D_i$) are determined by the Fourier coefficients ($A_n$) of the spanwise circulation distribution $\\Gamma(\\theta)$.\n\n**1. Total Lift (L):**\nAccording to Prandtl's lifting-line theory (RAG Chunk 2), the total lift coefficient $C_L$ for the entire wing is given by:\n$C_L = A_1 \\pi AR$\nwhere $A_1$ is the first Fourier coefficient and $AR$ is the aspect ratio of the wing.\n\nThe general Fourier series representation for circulation distribution is (RAG Chunk 2, 4):\n$\\Gamma(\\theta) = 2bV_\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \\sin(n\\theta)$\n\nThe problem states the given circulation distribution is $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$. Comparing this to the general series, we can infer the coefficients:\n- For $n=1$, there is no $\\sin\\theta$ term, so $A_1 = 0$.\n- For $n=2$, there is no $\\sin 2\\theta$ term, so $A_2 = 0$.\n- For $n=3$, we have $A \\sin 3\\theta = 2bV_\\infty A_3 \\sin 3\\theta$, which implies $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$.\n- All other $A_n = 0$ for $n > 3$.\n\nSince $C_L$ depends solely on $A_1$, and we found $A_1 = 0$, the total lift coefficient $C_L = 0 \\cdot \\pi AR = 0$. Consequently, the total lift $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_L = 0$.\n\n**2. Induced Drag (D_i):**\nThe induced drag coefficient $C_{D,i}$ is given by the formula:\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n^2$\n\nSubstituting the non-zero coefficient $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ into this formula (since $A_1=0, A_2=0$, etc.):\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (1 \\cdot A_1^2 + 2 \\cdot A_2^2 + 3 \\cdot A_3^2 + ...)$\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 \\cdot A_3^2)$\n\nThe problem states that $A \\ne 0$. Since $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$, it follows that $A_3 \\ne 0$. Therefore, $A_3^2 \\ne 0$.\n\nThus, $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 A_3^2) \\ne 0$. Consequently, the induced drag $D_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_{D,i} \\ne 0$.\n\nBased on this analysis, $L = 0$ and $D_i \\ne 0$, which corresponds to Option B."

          "**Step 1: Understand the given circulation distribution.** The problem provides the spanwise circulation distribution as $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$. This is a specific form of circulation, expressed in terms of the angular coordinate $\\theta$, which is commonly used in Prandtl's lifting-line theory.",
          "**Step 2: Relate the given circulation to the general Fourier series.** In Prandtl's lifting-line theory, the general circulation distribution is represented by a Fourier sine series: $\\Gamma(\\theta) = 2bV_\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \\sin(n\\theta)$. By comparing the given $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$ with this general form, we identify the non-zero Fourier coefficients. In this case, only the $n=3$ term is present, meaning $A_1=0$, $A_2=0$, and $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ (since $A \\ne 0$).",
          "**Step 3: Calculate the total lift (L).** The total lift coefficient $C_L$ for the wing is directly proportional to the first Fourier coefficient, $A_1$, as per the formula $C_L = A_1 \\pi AR$ (RAG Chunk 2). Since we determined $A_1 = 0$ from the given circulation distribution, it implies $C_L = 0$. Therefore, the total lift $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_L = 0$.",
          "**Step 4: Calculate the induced drag (D_i).** The induced drag coefficient $C_{D,i}$ is given by the formula $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n^2$. Since only $A_3$ is non-zero in this case, the sum simplifies to $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 A_3^2)$. As $A \\ne 0$, $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ is also non-zero. Consequently, $A_3^2 \\ne 0$, which means $C_{D,i} \\ne 0$. Therefore, the induced drag $D_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_{D,i} \\ne 0$.",

While the explicit formula for induced drag coefficient ($C_{D,i} = \\pi AR \\sum n A_n^2$) was not directly in the RAG, the components for its derivation (induced angle of attack in terms of $A_n$) were present, and it is a standard result in the theory. The RAG was very helpful in confirming the core principles needed to solve the question."
