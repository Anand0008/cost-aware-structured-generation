However, induced drag depends on all Fourier coefficients via C_Di = π AR Σ n A_n^2. Since A_3 ≠ 0, induced drag is non-zero.

Furthermore, the downwash varies along the span as $w(\\theta) = V_\\infty \\left(\\frac{3A \\sin 3\\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right)$, where $V_\\infty$ is the freestream velocity. Which one of the following options represents the total lift ($L$) and induced drag ($D_i$)?"
