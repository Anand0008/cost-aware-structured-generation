The speed of the aircraft ($V$) is 230 m/s. Gas constant R= 287 J/kg/K, and specific heat ratio $\\gamma = 1.4$. If the stagnation pressure is $p_o$, and static pressure is $p$, the value of $\\left[ \\frac{p_o - p}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2} \\right]$ is ________ (rounded off to two decimal places)."
