        "reasoning": "The problem requires ensuring dynamic similarity by matching the Reynolds number for two different wings tested in the same wind tunnel. The key is to correctly calculate the characteristic length (chord) for the second wing using its aspect ratio and the given information that its span is the same as the first wing. Once the chords are known, the Reynolds number equation can be set up for equality, and the unknown velocity can be solved. The calculation `V2 = (V1 * c1) / c2 = (60 * 1.2) / 1 = 72 m/s` is straightforward and confirms the provided answer."

          "Step 3: Calculate the span ($b_1$) of the first wing. For a rectangular wing, the aspect ratio is defined as $AR = \\frac{b}{c}$. Therefore, $b_1 = AR_1 \\times c_1 = 5 \\times 1.2 \\text{ m} = 6.0 \\text{ m}$.",
          "Step 4: Identify the given parameters for the second wing (Wing 2): aspect ratio $AR_2 = 6$. It is stated that the second wing has the same span as the first wing, so $b_2 = b_1 = 6.0$ m.",

          "Step 6: Apply the condition for dynamic similarity: the Reynolds number for the first test must be equal to the Reynolds number for the second test ($Re_1 = Re_2$). Using the chord length as the characteristic length ($L$): $$\\frac{\\rho V_1 c_1}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\rho V_2 c_2}{\\mu}$$",
          "Step 7: Since the tests are performed in the same wind tunnel with the same air, the density ($\\rho$) and dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$) are constant and cancel out from both sides of the equation: $V_1 c_1 = V_2 c_2$.",
          "Step 8: Solve for the unknown airspeed $V_2$: $V_2 = \\frac{V_1 c_1}{c_2} = \\frac{(60 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1.2 \\text{ m})}{1.0 \\text{ m}} = 72 \\text{ m/s}$."
