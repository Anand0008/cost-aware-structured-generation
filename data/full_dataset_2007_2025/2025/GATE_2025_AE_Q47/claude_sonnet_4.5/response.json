Using the Reynolds number formula, $Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}$, and rearranging to solve for the velocity $V$, we get:\n\n$V_2 = \\frac{Re_1 \\mu_1}{\\rho_1 L_1} \\cdot \\frac{L_2}{L_1}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$V_2 = \\frac{(Re_1)(\\mu_1)}{(\\rho_1)(L_1)} \\cdot \\frac{L_2}{L_1}$\n$V_2 = \\frac{(Re_1)(1.8\\times10^{-5})}{(1.3)(1.2)} \\cdot \\frac{1.2}{1.2} = \\frac{(Re_1)(1.8\\times10^{-5})}{1.56}$\n\nThe Reynolds number for the first wing is:\n$Re_1 = \\frac{(1.3)(60)(1.2)}{1.8\\times10^{-5}} = 5.4\\times10^6$\n\nSubstituting this into the velocity equation:\n$V_2 = \\frac{(5.4\\times10^6)(1.8\\times10^{-5})}{1.56} = 72 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nTherefore, the air speed for the second wing should be 72 m/s to maintain the same Reynolds number as the first wing."
