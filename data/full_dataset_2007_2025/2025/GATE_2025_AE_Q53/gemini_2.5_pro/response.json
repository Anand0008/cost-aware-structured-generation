Since the angles are measured from periapsis (P), the phase angle is zero. Substituting the given radial distances and true anomalies for points F and G yields a system of two equations with two unknowns (p and e), which can be solved algebraically. The calculated eccentricity is approximately 0.666..., which rounds to 0.67, falling within the specified range."

          "Step 1: Identify the governing equation for an orbit. The polar equation of a conic section (orbit) with the focus at the origin and periapsis along the positive x-axis (where true anomaly $\\theta$ is measured from periapsis) is given by $r = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(\\theta)}$, where $r$ is the radial distance, $p$ is the semi-latus rectum (or parameter of the orbit), and $e$ is the eccentricity.",
          "Step 2: Apply the orbital equation to point F. Given $OF = r_F = 8000$ km and $\\theta_F = 0$ deg. Substitute these values into the equation: $8000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(0^\\circ)}$. Since $\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1$, this simplifies to $8000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e}$ (Equation 1).",
          "Step 3: Apply the orbital equation to point G. Given $OG = r_G = 10000$ km and $\\theta_G = 60$ deg. Substitute these values into the equation: $10000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(60^\\circ)}$. Since $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$, this simplifies to $10000 = \\frac{p}{1 + 0.5e}$ (Equation 2).",
          "Step 4: Solve the system of two equations for the eccentricity $e$. From Equation 1, express $p$ in terms of $e$: $p = 8000(1 + e)$.",

          "Step 6: Rearrange and solve for $e$: $10000(1 + 0.5e) = 8000(1 + e)$. Divide both sides by 1000: $10(1 + 0.5e) = 8(1 + e)$. Expand: $10 + 5e = 8 + 8e$. Isolate $e$: $10 - 8 = 8e - 5e \\implies 2 = 3e \\implies e = \\frac{2}{3}$.",
