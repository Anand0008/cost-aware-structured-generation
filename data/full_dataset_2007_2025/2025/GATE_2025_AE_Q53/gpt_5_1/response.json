        "notes": "RAG provided general orbit equation forms, eccentricity relations, and examples from Anderson and NPTEL lectures. While not tailored to this exact numerical problem, they confirmed the correct polar equation r = p/(1 + e cos(\\theta - C)) and contextual understanding of eccentricity. The detailed numerical solution relied primarily on internal orbital mechanics knowledge."
