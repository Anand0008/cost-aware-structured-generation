The specific thrust per unit core mass flow rate is then derived from this total thrust.\n\nThe general thrust equation for an unmixed turbofan is:\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(1+f)V_e + \\dot{m}_{a,f}V_f - (\\dot{m}_{a,c} + \\dot{m}_{a,f})U_0 + (P_e - P_a)A_e + (P_f - P_a)A_f$`\n\nGiven conditions:\n1.  Bypass ratio `$\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{a,f}}{\\dot{m}_{a,c}} = 5 \\implies \\dot{m}_{a,f} = \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}$`\n2.  Fuel mass flow rate is negligible, so `f \\approx 0`.\n3.  Optimally expanded nozzles, so `P_e = P_a` and `P_f = P_a`. This means the pressure thrust terms `$(P_e - P_a)A_e$` and `$(P_f - P_a)A_f$` are zero.\n4.  Static specific thrust, so flight velocity `U_0 = 0`.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the thrust equation:\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(1+0)V_e + (\\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c})V_f - (\\dot{m}_{a,c} + \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}) \\times 0 + 0 + 0$`\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}V_e + \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}V_f$`\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(V_e + \\alpha V_f)$`\n\nThe question asks for the static specific thrust (`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c}$`):\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{a,c}(V_e + \\alpha V_f)}{\\dot{m}_{a,c}}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = V_e + \\alpha V_f$`\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n`$V_e = 600 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$V_f = 120 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$\\alpha = 5$`\n\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 600 \\text{ m/s} + 5 \\times 120 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 600 \\text{ m/s} + 600 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 1200 \\text{ Ns/kg}$`\n\nThe unit Ns/kg is equivalent to m/s, which is consistent with specific thrust (momentum per unit mass flow rate)."

    "question_text": "An ideal turbofan with a bypass ratio of 5 has core mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 100$ kg/s. The core and the fan exhausts are separate and optimally expanded. The core exhaust speed is 600 m/s and the fan exhaust speed is 120 m/s. If the fuel mass flow rate is negligible in comparison to $\\dot{m}_{a,c}$, the static specific thrust ($T/\\dot{m}_{a,c}$) developed by the engine is ____ Ns/kg (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
