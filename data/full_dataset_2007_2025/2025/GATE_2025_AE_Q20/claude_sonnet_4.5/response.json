This can be explained as follows:\n\nFor a pair of point vortices with clockwise circulation Γ, separated by a distance a, the velocity field induced by one vortex at the location of the other vortex is directed perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex centers. This velocity field causes the vortices to rotate around their common centroid O in a clockwise direction. The magnitude of this rotational velocity is Γ/(2πa), which is consistent with the physical intuition that stronger circulation (Γ) and smaller separation (a) lead to faster rotation."
