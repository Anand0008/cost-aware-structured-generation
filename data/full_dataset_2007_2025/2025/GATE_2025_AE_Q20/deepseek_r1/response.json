        "reasoning": "In two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid potential flow, each point vortex induces a velocity field. For a point vortex with circulation $\\Gamma$, the induced tangential velocity at a distance $r$ is $v_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$. For two vortices with clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$ separated by distance $a$, each vortex induces a velocity on the other perpendicular to the line joining them. Due to symmetry, these induced velocities cause both vortices to move in circular paths around their centroid (midpoint). The direction of rotation matches the direction of circulation: clockwise circulation leads to clockwise rotation around the centroid. Options A and B describe translation, which occurs for vortices with opposite signs, not same signs."

          "Step 2: Consider two point vortices with clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$ each, separated by distance $a$. Vortex 1 induces a velocity on vortex 2. The direction is perpendicular to the line connecting them; for clockwise circulation, using the right-hand rule, the induced velocity on vortex 2 is into the page if vortices are horizontal, but effectively, it causes motion tangent to a circle centered at the midpoint.",
          "Step 3: Similarly, vortex 2 induces an equal and opposite relative velocity on vortex 1. Thus, both vortices experience forces that are symmetric about their centroid.",
