        "reasoning": "For a point vortex of strength \\(\\Gamma\\) at the origin, the tangential velocity at radius \\(r\\) is \\(v_\\theta = -\\Gamma/(2\\pi r)\\) (clockwise for positive \\(\\Gamma\\) in the given convention). Each vortex in the pair moves with the local fluid velocity induced by the other vortex, evaluated at its center. Place the vortices at \\((\\pm a/2, 0)\\). At the left vortex, the right vortex induces a vertical velocity only: the radial line from the right vortex to the left vortex is along negative x, so the tangential direction (clockwise circulation) is downward. Magnitude is \\(|v| = |\\Gamma|/(2\\pi a)\\). Similarly, at the right vortex, the left vortex induces an equal-magnitude upward velocity. Thus the vortices do not translate together; instead each moves around the centroid O in a circular path, forming a rotating pair. Because the induced velocities are such that the left vortex moves downward and the right vortex upward, the line joining them rotates clockwise about O. Hence the correct qualitative description is that the vortices rotate clockwise around each other about their centroid O, which is option C."

          "Step 2: Place the two vortices on the x-axis at positions \\(( -a/2, 0 )\\) and \\(( +a/2, 0 )\\), each with clockwise circulation \\(\\Gamma\\). The distance between them is \\(a\\).",
          "Step 3: Compute the velocity induced at the left vortex by the right vortex. The line from the right vortex to the left vortex is along the negative x-direction, so the radial direction is leftwards. For clockwise circulation, the tangential direction at that point is downward. Therefore the induced velocity at the left vortex is vertically downward with magnitude \\(|v| = |\\Gamma|/(2\\pi a)\\).",
          "Step 4: By symmetry, the velocity induced at the right vortex by the left vortex is vertically upward with the same magnitude \\(|\\Gamma|/(2\\pi a)\\). Thus the vortices move in opposite vertical directions, not together up or down.",
          "Step 5: Because each vortex moves perpendicular to the line joining them and with equal speed, the pair executes a rigid-body-like rotation about their centroid O (the midpoint between them). The left vortex moves downward while the right moves upward, so the line joining them rotates clockwise.",
