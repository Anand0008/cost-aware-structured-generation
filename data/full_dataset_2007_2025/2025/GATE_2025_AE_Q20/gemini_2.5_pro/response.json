        "reasoning": "The motion of a point vortex is determined by the velocity induced at its location by all other vortices in the flow field. A vortex does not induce a velocity on itself. For a pair of point vortices with identical circulation, they will rotate around their common centroid. The direction of rotation depends on the direction of circulation. Given clockwise circulation for both vortices, the induced velocities will cause a clockwise rotation."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem setup. We have two point vortices, V1 and V2, separated by a distance 'a'. Both have clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$. Let's place V1 at $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$ and V2 at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. The centroid O is at $(0,0)$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for the velocity induced by a point vortex. For a point vortex with circulation $\\Gamma$ (positive for counter-clockwise, negative for clockwise) at the origin, the tangential velocity at a distance $r$ is $v_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$. If we use the convention where positive $\\Gamma$ is counter-clockwise, then for a clockwise circulation of magnitude $\\Gamma$, the induced velocity is $v_{\\theta} = -\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$. The negative sign indicates clockwise flow. Alternatively, if $\\Gamma$ is given as a positive magnitude for clockwise circulation, then the induced tangential velocity is $v_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$ in the clockwise direction.",
          "Step 3: Determine the velocity induced by V2 at the location of V1. Vortex V2 is at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$ and has clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$. At the location of V1 $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, the distance from V2 is $r = a$. The velocity induced by V2 at V1 will be tangential to a circle centered at V2. Since V1 is to the left of V2, and V2 has clockwise circulation, the induced velocity at V1 will be in the negative y-direction (downwards). The magnitude is $V_{V1} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$. So, V1 moves downwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$.",
          "Step 4: Determine the velocity induced by V1 at the location of V2. Vortex V1 is at $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$ and has clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$. At the location of V2 $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, the distance from V1 is $r = a$. The velocity induced by V1 at V2 will be tangential to a circle centered at V1. Since V2 is to the right of V1, and V1 has clockwise circulation, the induced velocity at V2 will be in the positive y-direction (upwards). The magnitude is $V_{V2} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$. So, V2 moves upwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the combined motion. Vortex V1 moves downwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$, and vortex V2 moves upwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$. Since they are moving in opposite vertical directions with equal speeds, they will rotate around their common centroid O (which is midway between them). The motion of V1 downwards and V2 upwards constitutes a clockwise rotation of the vortex pair about their centroid."
