        "reasoning": "Let the common weight–age function for both brothers be denoted by w(a). It is given that w(a) is strictly (monotonically) increasing for ages a < 50 and strictly decreasing for ages a > 50, with the same function applying to both brothers.\n\nWe are told that on some day the brothers have the same weight, i.e., w(a_1) = w(a_2) with a_1 < a_2.\n\n1) Because w(a) is strictly increasing on (−∞, 50), if both ages were less than 50 (option A: a_1 < a_2 < 50), then w(a_1) < w(a_2). They cannot be equal. So A is impossible.\n\n2) Because w(a) is strictly decreasing on (50, ∞), if both ages were greater than 50 (option C: 50 < a_1 < a_2), then w(a_1) > w(a_2). They cannot be equal. So C is impossible.\n\n3) Consider the case where one age is below 50 and the other above 50 (option B: a_1 < 50 < a_2). Since w(a) increases up to 50 and then decreases, the graph is unimodal with a single maximum at a = 50. For any weight value less than the maximum, there are exactly two distinct ages that give that same weight: one on the increasing side (a < 50) and one on the decreasing side (a > 50). Thus, there exist a_1 < 50 and a_2 > 50 such that w(a_1) = w(a_2). This is the only way to have w(a_1) = w(a_2) with a_1 \\neq a_2.\n\n4) Option D (either a_1 = 50 or a_2 = 50) would imply that one brother is exactly at the peak age. But then, for them to have the same weight, the other brother must also be at age 50, because w(50) is the unique maximum value and the function is strictly monotonic on each side. That would force a_1 = a_2 = 50, contradicting the given a_1 < a_2. Hence D is also impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent configuration is that the younger brother is younger than 50 and the older brother is older than 50, i.e., a_1 < 50 < a_2, which is option B."

          "Step 5: Case 3: Assume one age is exactly 50, say a_1 = 50. Then w(a_1) is the unique maximum. For w(a_2) to equal this maximum with a_2 \\neq 50, w would need to be flat near 50, contradicting strict monotonicity on each side. Thus a_1 = 50 or a_2 = 50 with a_1 < a_2 cannot occur. Reject option D.",
          "Step 6: Case 4: The remaining possibility is a_1 < 50 < a_2. For any weight less than the maximum, the unimodal shape guarantees exactly two ages with that weight: one on the left (a < 50) and one on the right (a > 50). Hence this configuration is not only possible but the only one consistent with w(a_1) = w(a_2), so option B is correct."
