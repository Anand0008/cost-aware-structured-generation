The problem states that $W(a)$ monotonically increases until the age of 50 years and then monotonically decreases. This implies that $a=50$ years is the age at which the person attains their maximum weight.\n\nWe are given two brothers with ages $a_1$ and $a_2$, such that $a_1 < a_2$. They attain the same weight, meaning $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.\n\nFor two distinct ages $a_1$ and $a_2$ to have the same weight, given the function's behavior (increasing then decreasing with a peak at $a=50$), one age must be on the increasing part of the function and the other on the decreasing part.\n\nSince $a_1 < a_2$:\n1. If $a_1$ is on the increasing part, then $a_1 < 50$.\n2. If $a_2$ is on the decreasing part, then $a_2 > 50$.\n\nCombining these conditions, we must have $a_1 < 50 < a_2$. This is the only way for two different ages to yield the same weight, with one age before the peak and the other after the peak.\n\nTherefore, statement B, $a_1 < 50 < a_2$, is correct."
