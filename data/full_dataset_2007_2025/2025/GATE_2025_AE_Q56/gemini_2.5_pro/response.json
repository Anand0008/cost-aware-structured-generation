          "**Step 1: Analyze Truss Geometry and Determinacy.** The truss consists of three members (AB, BC, AC) each of length 1 m, forming an equilateral triangle. This means all internal angles are $60^\\circ$. There are 3 joints (A, B, C) and 3 reactions (pin at A: $A_x, A_y$; roller at B: $B_y$). Since $m+r = 2j$ ($3+3 = 2 \\times 3 \\implies 6=6$), the truss is statically determinate.",
          "**Step 2: Calculate Support Reactions.** Consider the entire truss as a free body. The external load is a 50 N horizontal force at C, pointing right. The height of joint C from the base AB is $h = L_{AC} \\sin(60^\\circ) = 1 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ m.",

          "**Sum of forces in x-direction ($\\Sigma F_x = 0$):** $A_x + P_C = 0 \\implies A_x + 50 = 0 \\implies A_x = -50$ N (acting to the left).",
          "**Sum of forces in y-direction ($\\Sigma F_y = 0$):** $A_y + B_y = 0 \\implies A_y + 25\\sqrt{3} = 0 \\implies A_y = -25\\sqrt{3}$ N (acting downwards).",
          "**Step 3: Apply Method of Joints at Joint C.** Assume forces $F_{AC}$ and $F_{BC}$ are tensile (pulling away from the joint).",
          "**$\\Sigma F_y = 0$ at C:** $-F_{AC} \\sin(60^\\circ) - F_{BC} \\sin(60^\\circ) = 0 \\implies F_{AC} + F_{BC} = 0 \\implies F_{BC} = -F_{AC}$.",
          "**$\\Sigma F_x = 0$ at C:** $P_C + F_{BC} \\cos(60^\\circ) - F_{AC} \\cos(60^\\circ) = 0 \\implies 50 + F_{BC} \\times \\frac{1}{2} - F_{AC} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.
