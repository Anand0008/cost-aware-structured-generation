Multiply the mass flow rate for a single injector by the total number of injectors (800) to get the total mass flow rate.\n3. Use the thrust equation $F = \\dot{m} v_e$ and the given specific impulse of 1500 m/s to calculate the thrust.\n\nPlugging in the provided values, the total mass flow rate is approximately 290 kg/s, which results in a thrust of 435 kN, well within the correct answer range of 430.0 to 442.0 kN."
