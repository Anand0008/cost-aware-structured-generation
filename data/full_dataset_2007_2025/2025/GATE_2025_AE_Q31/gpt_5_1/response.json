        "reasoning": "For a closed system, the First Law is $\\delta Q = dU + \\delta W$ (with $\\delta W$ positive for work done by the system). In an adiabatic process, by definition, there is no heat transfer across the boundary, so $\\delta Q = 0$. The combustor is at constant pressure and is a closed system undergoing a process with volume change (reactants to products), so there is boundary $p\\,dV$ work. Therefore $\\delta W \\neq 0$. From the First Law with $\\delta Q = 0$, we get $0 = dU + \\delta W \\Rightarrow dU = -\\delta W$, so $dU$ is also non-zero and has the same magnitude as $\\delta W$ but opposite sign. Thus $|\\delta W| = |dU| \\neq 0$ and $|\\delta Q| = 0$, which matches option D. Options A and B incorrectly assign non-zero heat in an adiabatic process or zero work in a constant-pressure volume-changing process; option C incorrectly sets all three to zero, which would imply no change in state."

          "description": "Instead of starting from equations, sketch an energy diagram: chemical energy of reactants converts to thermal internal energy of products in an adiabatic combustor. Since no heat crosses the boundary, the only way for internal energy to change is via work at the boundary. This qualitative picture leads to the same conclusion: $\\delta Q = 0$, $dU \\neq 0$, $\\delta W \\neq 0$, and $|dU| = |\\delta W|$ from energy conservation.",
