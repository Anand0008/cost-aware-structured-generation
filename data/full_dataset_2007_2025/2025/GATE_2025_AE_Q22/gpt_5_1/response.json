        "reasoning": "To initiate a right turn, the aircraft must roll to the right (right wing down). For a conventional differential aileron system, this is achieved by deflecting the left aileron down (increasing lift on left wing) and the right aileron up (decreasing lift on right wing). This matches options A and B. However, due to adverse yaw, the increased lift and induced drag on the left wing (aileron down) cause the nose to yaw left, opposite to the desired right turn. To coordinate the turn (zero sideslip), the pilot must apply rudder to the right to generate a yawing moment to the right, cancelling adverse yaw. Therefore, the correct combination is: left aileron down, right aileron up, rudder right, which is option B."
