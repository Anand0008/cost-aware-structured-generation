This is achieved by deflecting the left aileron down (increasing lift on left wing) and right aileron up (decreasing lift on right wing), producing a roll to the right. However, due to adverse yaw, this aileron deflection causes a yawing moment to the left (opposite the turn). To coordinate the turn and prevent sideslip, rudder must be deflected to the right, creating a yawing moment to the right that counteracts the adverse yaw. Therefore, option B is correct."
