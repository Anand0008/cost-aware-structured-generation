Option B, with left aileron down, right aileron up, and right rudder, is the correct answer.\n\nWhen rolling right, the left aileron goes down to increase lift on the left wing, while the right aileron goes up to decrease lift on the right wing. This creates a rolling moment to the right. However, the increased lift on the left wing also creates more induced drag, causing an adverse yawing moment to the left. To counteract this adverse yaw and coordinate the turn, the pilot must apply right rudder deflection. This combination of aileron and rudder inputs results in a coordinated right turn."
