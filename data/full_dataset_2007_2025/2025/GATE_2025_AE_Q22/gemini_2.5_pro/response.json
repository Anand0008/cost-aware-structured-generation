        "reasoning": "To achieve a coordinated right turn, the aircraft must first roll to the right and then yaw to the right, while compensating for adverse yaw.\n\n1.  **Aileron Deflection for Right Roll**: To roll right, the right wing needs to lose lift, and the left wing needs to gain lift. This is achieved by deflecting the **right aileron UP** and the **left aileron DOWN**. (RAG Chunks 3, 4, 5)\n\n2.  **Adverse Yaw Effect**: When the left aileron deflects downward, it increases the lift on the left wing, but also significantly increases the induced drag on that wing. Conversely, the right aileron deflecting upward reduces lift and induced drag on the right wing. This differential drag creates a yawing moment that pulls the left wing backward, causing the nose of the aircraft to yaw to the **LEFT**. This unwanted yaw is known as adverse yaw. (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)\n\n3.  **Rudder Deflection for Coordinated Turn**: To counteract the adverse yaw (nose yawing left) and to achieve a coordinated turn to the right, the pilot must apply a compensatory yawing moment to the right. This is done by deflecting the rudder to the **RIGHT**. (RAG Chunk 6)\n\nCombining these actions: Left aileron: down; Right aileron: up; Rudder: right. This matches option B."

          "Step 3: Understand the phenomenon of 'adverse yaw'. When ailerons are deflected for a roll, the wing with the downward-deflected aileron (increasing lift) also experiences an increase in induced drag. The wing with the upward-deflected aileron (decreasing lift) experiences a decrease in drag. This differential drag creates a yawing moment opposite to the direction of the desired turn.",
          "Step 4: Apply the adverse yaw concept to a right turn. With the left aileron down and the right aileron up, the left wing generates more drag. This pulls the left wing back, causing the aircraft's nose to yaw to the left (adverse yaw).",
