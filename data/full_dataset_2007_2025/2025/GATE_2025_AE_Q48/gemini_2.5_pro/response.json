We are given the area ratio of the venturimeter, $A_1/A_2 = 1.3$ (inlet to throat), the maximum inlet speed of the airplane, $V_1 = 90 \\text{ m/s}$, and the density of air at sea level, $\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. The objective is to find the maximum pressure difference between the inlet and the throat, $p_1 - p_2$, in kPa.",
          "Step 2: Apply Bernoulli's equation for steady, incompressible, and inviscid flow between the inlet (station 1) and the throat (station 2) of the venturimeter. Bernoulli's equation states: $p_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_2^2$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the continuity equation for incompressible flow, which states that the mass flow rate is constant: $\\rho A_1 V_1 = \\rho A_2 V_2$. Since density is constant, this simplifies to $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$. From this, we can express the velocity at the throat, $V_2$, in terms of the inlet velocity $V_1$ and the area ratio: $V_2 = V_1 \\left( \\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\right)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the expression for $V_2$ from the continuity equation into Bernoulli's equation to derive a formula for the pressure difference: $p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (V_2^2 - V_1^2)$. Substituting $V_2$: $p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\left[ \\left( V_1 \\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\right)^2 - V_1^2 \\right]$. This simplifies to $p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_1^2 \\left[ \\left( \\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\right)^2 - 1 \\right]$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula: $p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (90 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\times \\left[ (1.3)^2 - 1 \\right]$. Calculate the terms: $(90)^2 = 8100$, $(1.3)^2 = 1.69$. So, $p_1 - p_2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225 \\times 8100 \\times (1.69 - 1)$.",
          "Step 6: Perform the multiplication: $p_1 - p_2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225 \\times 8100 \\times 0.69 = 3423.2625 \\text{ N/m}^2$.",
          "Step 7: Convert the pressure difference from Pascals (N/m²) to kiloPascals (kPa) as required by the question. Since $1 \\text{ kPa} = 1000 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{3423.2625}{1000} \\text{ kPa} = 3.4232625 \\text{ kPa}$. Rounding off to two decimal places gives $3.42 \\text{ kPa}$."
