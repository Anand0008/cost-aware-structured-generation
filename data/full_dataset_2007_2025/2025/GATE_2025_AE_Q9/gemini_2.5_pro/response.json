        "reasoning": "The given equation is $3^{x^2} = 27 \\times 9^x$. To solve for $x$, we express all terms with the same base, which is 3. We know that $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$. Substituting these into the equation gives: $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times (3^2)^x$. Using the exponent rule $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we get $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times 3^{2x}$. Applying the rule $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$, the equation becomes $3^{x^2} = 3^{3+2x}$. Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal: $x^2 = 3 + 2x$. Rearranging this into a standard quadratic equation yields $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+1) = 0$. This gives two possible values for $x$: $x=3$ or $x=-1$. The question asks for the value of the expression $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2}$. First, simplify the expression using exponent rules: $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2} = \\frac{2^{x^2}}{2^{2x}} = 2^{x^2 - 2x}$. Now, substitute the values of $x$ found: If $x=3$, then $x^2 - 2x = (3)^2 - 2(3) = 9 - 6 = 3$. So, the expression value is $2^3$. If $x=-1$, then $x^2 - 2x = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$. So, the expression value is $2^3$. Both values of $x$ lead to the same result, $2^3$. Therefore, the correct option is C."

          "Step 3: The equation becomes $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times 3^{2x}$. Use the exponent rule $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$ to combine the terms on the right side: $3^{x^2} = 3^{3+2x}$.",
          "Step 4: Since the bases are equal, equate the exponents: $x^2 = 3 + 2x$. Rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation: $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$.",
          "Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for $x$. This can be done by factoring: $(x-3)(x+1) = 0$. This yields two solutions for $x$: $x=3$ and $x=-1$.",
          "Step 6: Simplify the target expression $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2}$. Using exponent rules, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ and $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, the expression simplifies to $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{2^{2x}} = 2^{x^2 - 2x}$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute both values of $x$ (from Step 5) into the simplified expression $2^{x^2 - 2x}$. For $x=3$, the exponent is $(3)^2 - 2(3) = 9 - 6 = 3$. For $x=-1$, the exponent is $(-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$. In both cases, the exponent is 3.",
