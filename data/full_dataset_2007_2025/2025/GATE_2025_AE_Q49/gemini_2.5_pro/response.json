          "Step 2: Recall the definition of the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for external flow. The pressure coefficient is defined as $C_p = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{q_1}$, where $p_2$ is the static pressure on the surface (behind the shock), $p_1$ is the freestream static pressure, and $q_1$ is the freestream dynamic pressure.",

Using the relations $V_1 = M_1 a_1$ and $a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$, and $\\rho_1 = \\frac{p_1}{R T_1}$, we can derive $q_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma p_1 M_1^2$.",
