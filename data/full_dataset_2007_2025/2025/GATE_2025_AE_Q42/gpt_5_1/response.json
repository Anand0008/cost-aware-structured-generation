The given curve r = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (1 - \\sin \\theta) is a cardioid-like closed curve. For r to be non-negative, 1 - \\sin \\theta \\ge 0 \\Rightarrow \\sin \\theta \\le 1, which holds for all \\theta, and the curve is periodic with period 2\\pi, so the full closed curve is traced for \\theta from 0 to 2\\pi. Thus, \\displaystyle A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (1 - \\sin \\theta) \\right)^2 d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1 - 2\\sin \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta) d\\theta.
