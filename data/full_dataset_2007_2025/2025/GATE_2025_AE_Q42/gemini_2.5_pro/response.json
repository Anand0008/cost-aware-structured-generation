The general formula for the area enclosed by a polar curve $r = f(\\theta)$ from $\\theta = \\alpha$ to $\\theta = \\beta$ is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta} r^2 d\\theta$. For a complete cardioid, the integration limits are typically from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Substituting the given $r$ and integrating, we find the area to be 6. This matches the known formula for the area of a cardioid $r = a(1 \\pm \\sin \\theta)$ or $r = a(1 \\pm \\cos \\theta)$, which is $A = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi a^2$. Here, $a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}$, so $A = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right) = 6$."
