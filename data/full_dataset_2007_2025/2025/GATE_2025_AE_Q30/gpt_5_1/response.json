        "reasoning": "The undeformed plate is a square (described as a rhombus with all internal angles 90\\(^\\circ\\)), with diagonals AC and BD both 20 cm and aligned with the x and y axes respectively. In the deformed configuration, the figure shows that points A and C move horizontally by 0.02 cm (A to the right, C to the left), while points B and D move vertically by 0.02 cm (B upward, D downward). Thus, the displacements are: A(\\pm 0.02,0), C(\\mp 0.02,0), B(0,\\pm 0.02), D(0,\\mp 0.02). This is a pure normal stretching/compression along x and y, symmetric about the origin, with no relative tangential displacement between lines initially parallel to x and y. The diagonals change length: AC shortens from 20 to 19.96 cm (normal strain along x: \\epsilon_x = -0.04/20 = -0.002), BD lengthens from 20 to 20.04 cm (normal strain along y: \\epsilon_y = 0.04/20 = 0.002). For small strains, the engineering shear strain \\gamma_{xy} is related to the change in angle between lines along x and y. Because the deformation is purely normal (no xy cross terms in the displacement field), the right angle between x and y directions is preserved, so \\gamma_{xy} = 0. This is also consistent with the strain transformation relations: the observed equal and opposite normal strains along the diagonals can be produced by a state with only \\epsilon_x and \\epsilon_y and zero shear. Therefore the correct option is A: 0."

The lengths of the undeformed diagonals are 20 cm. ABCD deforms as shown by the dotted lines. Upon deformation, diagonal AC reduces to 19.96 cm and BD increases to 20.04 cm. In the given x-y coordinate system, the engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ is equal to ____."
