        "reasoning": "The undeformed plate is a square (rhombus with $90^\\circ$ internal angles) with its diagonals aligned with the x and y axes of the given coordinate system. The deformation described (diagonal AC reducing, diagonal BD increasing) and visually depicted in the image shows that the displacement components $u_x$ are solely a function of $x$ (i.e., $u_x(x)$) and $u_y$ are solely a function of $y$ (i.e., $u_y(y)$). Specifically, the image shows points on the x-axis (like B and D) only move along the x-axis, and points on the y-axis (like A and C) only move along the y-axis. The engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ is defined as $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$. Since $u_x$ does not depend on $y$ and $u_y$ does not depend on $x$, both partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$ are zero. Therefore, $\\gamma_{xy} = 0$. This type of deformation is a pure normal strain along the x and y axes, with no angular distortion between initially perpendicular lines along these axes."

          "Step 1: Understand the initial geometry and coordinate system. The problem states the undeformed plate is a square (rhombus with $90^\\circ$ internal angles) with diagonals of 20 cm. The image clearly shows these diagonals are aligned with the x and y axes of the given coordinate system.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the deformation. The image and text describe that diagonal AC (along the y-axis) reduces in length, and diagonal BD (along the x-axis) increases in length. Crucially, the deformation is symmetric, and points initially on the x-axis (like B and D) only move along the x-axis, and points initially on the y-axis (like A and C) only move along the y-axis. This implies that the x and y axes remain perpendicular after deformation.",
          "Step 3: Recall the definition of engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$. The engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ quantifies the change in the angle between two line segments that were initially parallel to the x and y axes, respectively. It is defined as $\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$, where $u_x$ and $u_y$ are the displacement components in the x and y directions.",
          "Step 4: Determine the displacement field characteristics. Since the deformation is purely along the x and y axes (i.e., no lateral movement of points on an axis), the displacement $u_x$ depends only on $x$ (i.e., $u_x(x)$) and $u_y$ depends only on $y$ (i.e., $u_y(y)$).",
          "Step 5: Calculate the partial derivatives. From Step 4, $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = 0$ (as $u_x$ is not a function of $y$) and $\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = 0$ (as $u_y$ is not a function of $x$).",
