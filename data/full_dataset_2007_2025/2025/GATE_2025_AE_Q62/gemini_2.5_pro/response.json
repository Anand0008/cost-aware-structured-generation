        "reasoning": "The problem involves two main thermodynamic processes: isentropic compression and constant pressure heat addition, which are fundamental to the Brayton cycle. First, the temperature after isentropic compression ($T_2$) is calculated using the isentropic relation for an ideal gas. Then, the heat added in the combustor ($Q_{in}$) is used with the specific heat at constant pressure ($C_p$) to determine the temperature leaving the combustor ($T_3$). The 'Eighty percent of the compressed air is supplied to a combustor' statement is interpreted as a distractor for this specific question, as the heat addition is given 'per kg of air', which is conventionally understood as per kg of air *flowing through the combustor* for calculating $T_3$. If it were interpreted as per kg of air entering the compressor, the result would be outside the expected range. The calculated value of 1454.8 K falls within the provided answer key range of 1454.0 to 1455.0 K."
