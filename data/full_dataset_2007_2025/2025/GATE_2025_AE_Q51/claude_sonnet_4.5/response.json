Using the isentropic flow relations and the continuity equation, we can derive the expression for mass flow rate and calculate the new value given the changed stagnation conditions.

The mass flow rate through a choked nozzle is given by: $\\dot{m} = A^* \\frac{p_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$\n2.
