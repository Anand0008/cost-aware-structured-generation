        "reasoning": "The flow is steady, one-dimensional, frictionless, with heat addition in a constant-area duct. For such a Rayleigh flow, the governing equations are continuity and momentum (since energy is affected by heat addition). However, the problem gives only inlet and downstream velocities and inlet pressure and density, and asks for downstream static pressure. With no area change and steady 1D flow, the mass flow rate is constant: $\\rho_1 V_1 = \\rho_2 V_2$. The momentum equation for a control volume between the two stations (neglecting body forces and wall shear) is $p_1 + \\rho_1 V_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 V_2^2$. Using continuity to express $\\rho_2$ in terms of $\\rho_1$, $V_1$, and $V_2$, we can solve directly for $p_2$ without needing the details of heat addition or energy equation.\n\nGiven: $p_1 = 100\\,\\text{kPa}$, $\\rho_1 = 1\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $V_1 = 100\\,\\text{m/s}$, $V_2 = 200\\,\\text{m/s}$.\n1. Continuity: $\\rho_1 V_1 = \\rho_2 V_2 \\Rightarrow \\rho_2 = \\rho_1 \\dfrac{V_1}{V_2} = 1 \\times \\dfrac{100}{200} = 0.5\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$.\n2. Momentum: $p_1 + \\rho_1 V_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 V_2^2$.\n   Substitute values (in SI units):\n   $p_1 = 100\\,000\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\rho_1 V_1^2 = 1 \\times 100^2 = 10\\,000\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\rho_2 V_2^2 = 0.5 \\times 200^2 = 0.5 \\times 40\\,000 = 20\\,000\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n   So: $100\\,000 + 10\\,000 = p_2 + 20\\,000 \\Rightarrow p_2 = 110\\,000 - 20\\,000 = 90\\,000\\,\\text{Pa} = 90\\,\\text{kPa}$.\nThis matches the official answer range 90 to 90 kPa."
