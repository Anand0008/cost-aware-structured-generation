From the provided image, we can see that the number of patients per shift (X) ranges from 5 to 8. Using the given formula, we can calculate the average earnings per shift as follows:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the earnings for each value of X.\nFor X = 5, earnings = ₹ 1000(5 - 0.2) = ₹ 4,800\nFor X = 6, earnings = ₹ 1000(6 - 0.2) = ₹ 5,800\nFor X = 7, earnings = ₹ 1000(7 - 0.2) = ₹ 6,800\nFor X = 8, earnings = ₹ 1000(8 - 0.2) = ₹ 7,800\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average earnings per shift.\nAverage earnings = (4,800 + 5,800 + 6,800 + 7,800) / 4 = ₹ 6,100\n\nTherefore, the average amount Dr. Gita earned per shift in the past 100 shifts is ₹ 6,100, which matches the correct answer A."
