        "reasoning": "The question describes an airplane perturbed with a small nose-up constant pitch rate ($q > 0$) and states that the pitch damping derivative $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative. We need to analyze the consequences for the horizontal tail.\n\n1.  **Effect of Pitch Rate on Tail Angle of Attack (Option A):**\n    When an aircraft pitches nose-up with an angular velocity $q$, a point on the horizontal tail, located at a distance $l_t$ (moment arm, positive for tail aft of CG) behind the center of gravity (CG), experiences an additional downward velocity component $w_t = q l_t$. This downward velocity component effectively increases the local angle of attack of the tail. The change in tail angle of attack due to pitch rate is given by $\\Delta \\alpha_t = \\frac{q l_t}{V}$, where $V$ is the freestream velocity. Since $q$ is positive (nose-up), $l_t$ is positive (tail aft), and $V$ is positive, $\\Delta \\alpha_t$ will be positive. Therefore, the angle of attack of the horizontal tail increases. **(Option A is TRUE)**\n\n2.  **Effect on Tail Lift (Option C):**\n    Assuming the horizontal tail is not stalled (as stated in the question) and has a positive lift curve slope ($a_t = \\frac{{\\partial C_{L,t}}}{{\\partial \\alpha_t}} > 0$), an increase in its angle of attack (from Option A) will lead to an increase in its lift coefficient ($\\Delta C_{L,t} = a_t \\Delta \\alpha_t > 0$). Consequently, the lift generated by the horizontal tail ($L_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S_t C_{L,t}$) will increase. **(Option C is TRUE)**\n\n3.  **Effect on Tail Pitching Moment (Options B and D):**\n    The pitching moment generated by the horizontal tail about the CG is $M_t = -L_t l_t$ (where a positive $L_t$ is typically upwards, creating a nose-down moment if $l_t$ is positive). An increase in tail lift ($\\Delta L_t > 0$) will result in a change in pitching moment $\\Delta M_t = -\\Delta L_t l_t$. Since $\\Delta L_t > 0$ and $l_t > 0$, $\\Delta M_t$ will be negative. A negative pitching moment is a nose-down moment. This nose-down moment *opposes* the initial nose-up pitch rate perturbation. A moment that opposes a perturbation is a *restoring* or *stabilizing* moment. Therefore, the contribution of the horizontal tail to the airplane's pitching moment about the center of gravity is more stabilizing. This is consistent with the given information that $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative, which implies a nose-down (stabilizing) moment for a nose-up pitch rate. **(Option B is TRUE, Option D is FALSE)**\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A, B, and C are true."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the perturbation. The airplane experiences a small nose-up constant pitch rate, $q$. By convention, a nose-up pitch rate is positive ($q > 0$).",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect of pitch rate on the horizontal tail's local angle of attack. The horizontal tail is located at a distance $l_t$ (moment arm) behind the center of gravity (CG). Due to the nose-up pitch rate $q$, the tail moves downwards relative to the aircraft's flight path. This downward velocity component, $w_t = q l_t$, increases the effective angle of attack of the tail. The change in tail angle of attack is $\\Delta \\alpha_t = \\frac{q l_t}{V}$, where $V$ is the freestream velocity. Since $q > 0$ and $l_t > 0$, $\\Delta \\alpha_t > 0$. This confirms Option A.",
          "Step 3: Determine the effect on tail lift. Given that the tail does not stall, its lift curve slope ($a_t = \\frac{{\\partial C_{L,t}}}{{\\partial \\alpha_t}}$) is positive. An increase in tail angle of attack ($\\Delta \\alpha_t > 0$) will lead to an increase in its lift coefficient ($\\Delta C_{L,t} = a_t \\Delta \\alpha_t > 0$). Consequently, the lift generated by the horizontal tail ($L_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S_t C_{L,t}$) will increase. This confirms Option C.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the tail's contribution to the pitching moment. The pitching moment generated by the tail about the CG is $M_t = -L_t l_t$. An increase in tail lift ($\\Delta L_t > 0$) results in a change in pitching moment $\\Delta M_t = -\\Delta L_t l_t$. Since $\\Delta L_t > 0$ and $l_t > 0$, $\\Delta M_t$ will be negative. A negative pitching moment is a nose-down moment.",
          "Step 5: Interpret the stabilizing effect. A nose-down moment generated in response to a nose-up pitch rate is a restoring moment, which acts to reduce the perturbation. This indicates a stabilizing effect. The problem statement also explicitly mentions that $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative. A negative $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ means that for a positive $q$, the change in $C_m$ is negative (nose-down moment), which is a damping/stabilizing effect. Therefore, the tail's contribution is more stabilizing. This confirms Option B and refutes Option D."

However, they lacked specific formulas or detailed explanations for the pitch damping derivative $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ and its direct impact on tail angle of attack due to pitch rate. I relied heavily on internal knowledge for the core dynamic stability aspects of the question."

The stability coefficient $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial q}$ ($C_m$ is the airplane pitching moment coefficient and $q$ is the pitch rate) is negative. The airplane is perturbed with a small nose-up constant pitch rate. Assume that the horizontal tail does not stall during the perturbation, and unsteady effects are neglected. When compared to steady and level flight condition, which of the following statements is/are true during the perturbed motion?"
