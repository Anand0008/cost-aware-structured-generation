For a conventional tail-aft airplane, the dominant contribution to \\(C_{m_q}\\) comes from the horizontal tail. With a nose-up pitch rate, the tail experiences an effective increase in angle of attack because its local flow sees an additional downward component due to rotation about the CG. Hence (A) the tail angle of attack increases. For a symmetric tail, lift is approximately \\(L_t = q_\\infty S_t a_t \\alpha_t\\); increased \\(\\alpha_t\\) implies increased tail lift magnitude, so (C) is true. Since the tail is aft of the CG, an increase in (typically downward) tail force produces a more negative (nose-down) moment increment, i.e., more stabilizing, consistent with \\(\\partial C_m/\\partial q < 0\\). Therefore (B) is true and (D) is false."

          "2. In a conventional tail-aft configuration, the horizontal tail is behind the CG. When the aircraft pitches nose-up with constant \\(q>0\\), the tail moves downward relative to the oncoming flow, effectively increasing its angle of attack.",
          "3. Assuming the tail does not stall and unsteady effects are neglected, the tail lift changes quasi-steadily with angle of attack: \\(C_{L,t} \\approx a_t \\alpha_t\\). Increased \\(\\alpha_t\\) implies increased magnitude of tail lift.",
          "4. For a typical statically stable airplane, the tail produces a downward force in trim. An increase in its (downward) lift with the tail aft of the CG increases the nose-down pitching moment magnitude, i.e., the tail contribution becomes more stabilizing.",

When compared to steady and level flight condition, which of the following statements is/are true during the perturbed motion?"
