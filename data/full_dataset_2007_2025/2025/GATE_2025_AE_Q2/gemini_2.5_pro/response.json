        "reasoning": "The sentence describes two events in the past: 'playing tennis' and 'it suddenly started to rain'. The action of playing tennis was ongoing for a period of time and was interrupted or stopped by the rain. This sequence of events requires the past perfect continuous tense to describe the longer, ongoing action that occurred before another specific past event. 'Had been playing' correctly conveys this meaning. 'Have been playing' is present perfect continuous, 'would have been playing' is a conditional tense, and 'could be playing' implies present/future possibility or past ability, none of which fit the context."

          "Step 5: Option A, 'have been playing', is present perfect continuous, indicating an action that started in the past and continues to the present or has just finished. This does not fit the past context.",
          "Step 6: Option B, 'had been playing', is past perfect continuous, indicating an action that started in the past, continued for some duration, and was ongoing or just completed when another past event happened. This perfectly matches the context.",
          "Step 7: Option C, 'would have been playing', is a conditional perfect continuous tense, used for hypothetical situations in the past. This is not applicable here.",
          "Step 8: Option D, 'could be playing', implies possibility in the present or future, or past ability, which is incorrect for the given context.",
          "Step 9: Conclude that 'had been playing' is the most appropriate option."
