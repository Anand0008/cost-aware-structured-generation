        "reasoning": "The limit $\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{1 - \\cos(2x)}}{{x^2}}$ evaluates to the integer 2. This can be confirmed using two primary methods: L'Hopital's Rule or Taylor series expansion.\n\n**Method 1: Using L'Hopital's Rule**\n1.  Substitute $x=0$: The expression becomes $\\frac{{1 - \\cos(0)}}{{0^2}} = \\frac{{1 - 1}}{{0}} = \\frac{{0}}{{0}}$, which is an indeterminate form. Thus, L'Hopital's Rule is applicable.\n2.  Apply L'Hopital's Rule (first time): Differentiate the numerator and denominator separately.\n    *   Numerator derivative: $\\frac{{d}}{{dx}}(1 - \\cos(2x)) = -(-\\sin(2x) \\cdot 2) = 2\\sin(2x)$\n    *   Denominator derivative: $\\frac{{d}}{{dx}}(x^2) = 2x$\n    The limit becomes $\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{2\\sin(2x)}}{{2x}} = \\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{\\sin(2x)}}{{x}}$.\n3.  Substitute $x=0$ again: The expression is still $\\frac{{\\sin(0)}}{{0}} = \\frac{{0}}{{0}}$, another indeterminate form.\n4.  Apply L'Hopital's Rule (second time): Differentiate the new numerator and denominator separately.\n    *   Numerator derivative: $\\frac{{d}}{{dx}}(\\sin(2x)) = \\cos(2x) \\cdot 2 = 2\\cos(2x)$\n    *   Denominator derivative: $\\frac{{d}}{{dx}}(x) = 1$\n    The limit becomes $\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{2\\cos(2x)}}{{1}}$.\n5.  Evaluate the limit: Substitute $x=0$: $\\frac{{2\\cos(0)}}{{1}} = \\frac{{2 \\cdot 1}}{{1}} = 2$.\n\n**Method 2: Using Taylor Series Expansion**\n1.  Recall the Taylor series expansion for $\\cos(u)$ around $u=0$: $\\cos(u) = 1 - \\frac{{u^2}}{{2!}} + \\frac{{u^4}}{{4!}} - \\dots$\n2.  Substitute $u=2x$: $\\cos(2x) = 1 - \\frac{{(2x)^2}}{{2!}} + \\frac{{(2x)^4}}{{4!}} - \\dots = 1 - \\frac{{4x^2}}{{2}} + \\frac{{16x^4}}{{24}} - \\dots = 1 - 2x^2 + \\frac{{2x^4}}{{3}} - \\dots$\n3.  Substitute this into the original limit expression:\n    $\\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{1 - (1 - 2x^2 + \\frac{{2x^4}}{{3}} - \\dots)}}{{x^2}} = \\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{1 - 1 + 2x^2 - \\frac{{2x^4}}{{3}} + \\dots}}{{x^2}}$\n    $= \\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{2x^2 - \\frac{{2x^4}}{{3}} + \\dots}}{{x^2}}$\n4.  Factor out $x^2$ from the numerator and cancel:\n    $= \\lim_{{x \\to 0}} \\frac{{x^2(2 - \\frac{{2x^2}}{{3}} + \\dots)}}{{x^2}} = \\lim_{{x \\to 0}} (2 - \\frac{{2x^2}}{{3}} + \\dots)$\n5.  Evaluate the limit: Substitute $x=0$: $2 - 0 + \\dots = 2$.\n\nBoth methods consistently yield 2, confirming the correct answer."
