        "reasoning": "Static roll (lateral) stability is characterized by a negative rolling moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle, C_l_beta < 0. A destabilizing effect contributes positively to C_l_beta (or makes it less negative).\n- Option A (positive dihedral): Dihedral increases the angle of attack of the wing into the sideslip, creating more lift on that wing, generating a restoring rolling moment. This gives a negative contribution to C_l_beta, thus stabilizing.\n- Option B (high wing): In a sideslip, the fuselage below the wing acts as a stabilizing surface. The side force on the fuselage creates a rolling moment that tends to level the wings. This contributes a negative C_l_beta, stabilizing.\n- Option C (low wing): In a low-wing configuration, the fuselage is above the wing. During sideslip, the aerodynamic interaction can produce a rolling moment that increases the bank, i.e., a positive contribution to C_l_beta, which is destabilizing. This is why low-wing aircraft often require more dihedral for adequate stability.\n- Option D (swept back wing): Sweepback causes the wing into the sideslip to have a larger effective chord and angle of attack, increasing its lift, while the opposite wing experiences reduced lift. This generates a restoring rolling moment, contributing a negative C_l_beta, stabilizing.\nTherefore, only a low-wing configuration (C) has a destabilizing effect, as confirmed by the RAG context (Chunk 1) and standard stability theory."

          "Step 1: Recall the criterion for static roll (lateral) stability. An aircraft is laterally statically stable if it generates a rolling moment that tends to restore it to wings-level after a sideslip disturbance. Mathematically, this requires the derivative of rolling moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle, C_l_beta, to be negative (C_l_beta < 0).",
          "Step 2: Understand that each design feature contributes a component to the overall C_l_beta. A destabilizing feature contributes a positive value to C_l_beta, making it less negative or even positive.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate each option based on its known effect on C_l_beta:\n   - A. Positive dihedral angle: Increases the angle of attack of the wing into the sideslip, creating a lift differential that rolls the aircraft back to level. Contribution: (C_l_beta)_dihedral < 0 (stabilizing).\n   - B. High-wing configuration: The fuselage below the wing experiences a side force during sideslip, creating a rolling moment that levels the wings. Contribution: (C_l_beta)_high_wing < 0 (stabilizing).\n   - C. Low-wing configuration: The fuselage above the wing can create a side force that produces a rolling moment in the direction of the sideslip, increasing the bank. Contribution: (C_l_beta)_low_wing > 0 (destabilizing) or at least less stabilizing than a high wing.\n   - D. Swept-back wing: The wing into the sideslip becomes effectively less swept, increasing its lift, while the other wing becomes more swept, decreasing lift. This creates a restoring roll moment. Contribution: (C_l_beta)_sweep < 0 (stabilizing).",

Specifically, Chunk 1 clearly explained that a high-wing configuration is stabilizing while a low-wing configuration is less stable or destabilizing, which is crucial for answering the question. Chunks 2, 3, and 4 confirmed the stabilizing effects of dihedral and sweepback. The RAG context was sufficient and accurate for answering this conceptual question."
