        "reasoning": "Lateral static stability refers to an aircraft's inherent tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance causes a bank or sideslip. This stability is primarily quantified by the rolling moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle, `C_l_\\beta`. For an aircraft to be statically stable in roll, `C_l_\\beta` must be negative, meaning a positive sideslip angle produces a negative (restoring) rolling moment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. Wing with a positive dihedral angle:** Dihedral is the upward angle of the wings relative to the horizontal. When an aircraft with positive dihedral experiences a sideslip, the wing on the side towards the sideslip (e.g., the right wing during a sideslip to the left) experiences a higher effective angle of attack compared to the other wing. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment, thus contributing to lateral static stability (`C_l_\\beta < 0`). (RAG Chunks 2, 3, 4, 6)\n*   **B. Fuselage with a high wing:** In a high-wing configuration, the fuselage is positioned below the wing. During a sideslip, the fuselage acts like a keel or a stabilizing surface below the wing's center of pressure. The airflow pushing against the side of the fuselage below the wing generates a side force that creates a restoring rolling moment, enhancing lateral static stability (`C_l_\\beta < 0`). (RAG Chunks 1, 4)\n*   **C. Fuselage with a low wing:** In a low-wing configuration, the fuselage is positioned above the wing. When a sideslip occurs, the fuselage above the wing does not provide the same stabilizing 'keel effect' as in a high-wing configuration. Instead, the fuselage can partially obstruct the airflow over the wing on the side of the sideslip, or the forces generated by the fuselage above the wing may create a destabilizing or neutral rolling moment. This configuration generally has a destabilizing or less stabilizing effect on lateral stability, often requiring additional dihedral to compensate. (RAG Chunks 1, 2)\n*   **D. Swept back wing:** Swept-back wings inherently contribute to lateral static stability. When an aircraft with swept-back wings experiences a sideslip, the wing advancing into the relative wind (e.g., the right wing during a sideslip to the left) becomes effectively 'less swept' relative to the airflow and experiences an increased effective angle of attack and lift. Conversely, the lagging wing becomes 'more swept' and experiences a decreased angle of attack and lift. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment, contributing to lateral static stability (`C_l_\\beta < 0`). (RAG Chunk 4)\n\nBased on this analysis, a fuselage with a low wing is the only option that has a destabilizing effect on static roll stability among the given choices."

          "Step 1: Define static roll (lateral) stability. Lateral static stability is the aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance causing a bank or sideslip. It is characterized by a negative rolling moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle (`C_l_\\beta < 0`), indicating a restoring moment.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect of a positive dihedral angle. Positive dihedral creates a differential lift during sideslip (the wing into the wind generates more lift), producing a restoring roll moment. Thus, positive dihedral is stabilizing.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of a high-wing configuration. In a high-wing design, the fuselage below the wing acts as a stabilizing surface during sideslip, generating a restoring roll moment. Thus, a high wing is stabilizing.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of a swept-back wing. Swept-back wings, during sideslip, cause the leading wing to experience a higher effective angle of attack and lift, creating a restoring roll moment. Thus, a swept-back wing is stabilizing.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the effect of a low-wing configuration. In a low-wing design, the fuselage is above the wing. This configuration does not provide the same inherent stabilizing effect as a high wing and can even contribute a destabilizing or neutral rolling moment during sideslip.",
          "Step 6: Compare the effects. Since positive dihedral, high wing, and swept-back wings all contribute to lateral static stability, the low-wing configuration is the one that has a destabilizing effect on static roll stability."
