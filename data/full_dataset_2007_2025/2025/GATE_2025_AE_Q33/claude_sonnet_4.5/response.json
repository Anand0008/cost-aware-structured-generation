Combustion of methane:\n   CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n   Moles of O2 required per mole of CH4 = 2\n\n2. Combustion of ammonia:\n   2NH3 + 3/2O2 → N2 + 3H2O\n   Moles of O2 required per 2 moles of NH3 = 3/2\n\n3. Total moles of O2 required:\n   (3 moles CH4 × 2) + (2 moles NH3 × 3/2) = 7.5 moles O2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, which is 7.5 moles of pure oxygen required for the stoichiometric combustion of the given fuel mixture."
