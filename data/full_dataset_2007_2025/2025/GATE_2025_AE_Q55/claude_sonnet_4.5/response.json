This indicates a lateral contraction, which is related to the axial strain through Poisson's ratio:\n$\\epsilon_y = \\epsilon_z = -\nu \\epsilon_x$\nRearranging, we get:\n$\nu = -\\frac{\\epsilon_y}{\\epsilon_x} = -\\frac{0.002}{0.0005} = 0.4$\n\nTherefore, the Poisson's ratio of the material is 0.4."
