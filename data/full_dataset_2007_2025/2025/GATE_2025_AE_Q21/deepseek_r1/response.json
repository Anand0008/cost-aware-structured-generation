        "reasoning": "The Mach number ($M$) is fundamentally defined as the ratio of flow velocity ($V$) to the local speed of sound ($a$): $M = V/a$. In fluid dynamics, dimensionless numbers often arise from ratios of forces. The speed of sound $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$ is related to the elastic (compressibility) property of the fluid. Therefore, the Mach number squared ($M^2$) is proportional to the ratio of inertial forces ($\\rho V^2$) to elastic forces (related to bulk modulus or pressure). Hence, $M$ is the square root of (inertia force/elastic force). This is a standard interpretation confirmed by multiple RAG chunks (Chunks 1, 5, and 6). Option B correctly states $\\sqrt{\\text{inertia force}/\\text{elastic force}}$. Option A is the Reynolds number, Option C is not a standard dimensionless number, and Option D is the inverse of the square root of the Reynolds number."
