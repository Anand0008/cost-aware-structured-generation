        "reasoning": "The Mach number ($M$) is fundamentally defined as the ratio of the flow velocity ($V$) to the local speed of sound ($a$), i.e., $M = V/a$. From a dimensional analysis perspective, the Mach number is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the importance of compressibility effects. It represents the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces in a fluid flow. Elastic forces are associated with the compressibility of the fluid and the propagation of pressure waves (sound). Specifically, the square of the Mach number ($M^2$) is proportional to the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces. Therefore, the Mach number itself is proportional to the square root of this ratio. RAG chunks 1 and 5 explicitly state this relationship: 'The Mach number relates inertial forces to elastic forces' and 'It also signifies the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces (related to the fluid\\'s compressibility).'"
