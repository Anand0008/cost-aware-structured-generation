Each triangle (numbered 1 to 12) is used to form a square of side r cm.\n\nTo find the number of squares that can be formed, we need to consider the geometry of the dodecagon and the triangles. Since the triangles are used to form squares of side r cm, the number of squares that can be formed is equal to the number of triangles, which is 12.\n\nTo find the number of triangles required to form each square, we can observe that each square is formed using 4 triangles. Therefore, the number of triangles required to form each square is 4.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A: 3 squares, 4 triangles per square."
