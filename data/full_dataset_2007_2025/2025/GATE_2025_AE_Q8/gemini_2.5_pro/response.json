        "reasoning": "The problem involves a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) inscribed in a circle of radius $r$. This dodecagon is composed of 12 congruent isosceles triangles, each with two sides equal to the radius $r$ and the included angle being the central angle of the dodecagon. The central angle for a regular 12-sided polygon is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$. The area of one such triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} r^2$. The problem asks to form squares of side $r$. The area of one such square is $r^2$. To find how many triangles are required to form one square, we divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: $\\frac{r^2}{\\frac{1}{4} r^2} = 4$. Since there are 12 triangles available in total, and each square requires 4 triangles, the total number of squares that can be formed is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$. Therefore, 3 squares can be formed, and 4 triangles are required for each square, which corresponds to option A."

          "Step 2: Calculate the central angle of each triangle. For a regular $n$-sided polygon, the central angle subtended by each side at the center is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{n}$. For a dodecagon, $n=12$, so the central angle is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the area of one of these triangles. The area of a triangle with two sides $a, b$ and included angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin(\\theta)$. In this case, $a=r$, $b=r$, and $\\theta=30^\\circ$. So, the area of one triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} r^2$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the area of one square. The problem states that squares of side $r$ cm are to be formed. The area of a square with side $s$ is $s^2$. Thus, the area of one square is $r^2$.",
          "Step 5: Determine the number of triangles required to form one square. Divide the area of one square by the area of one triangle: $\\text{Number of triangles per square} = \\frac{\\text{Area of square}}{\\text{Area of triangle}} = \\frac{r^2}{\\frac{1}{4} r^2} = 4$.",
          "Step 6: Determine the total number of squares that can be formed. Since there are 12 triangles available in total (numbered 1 to 12) and each square requires 4 triangles, the total number of squares is $\\frac{\\text{Total number of triangles}}{\\text{Number of triangles per square}} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$."
