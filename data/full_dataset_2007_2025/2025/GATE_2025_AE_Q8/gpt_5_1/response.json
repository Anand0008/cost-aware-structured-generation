The central angle for each triangle is 360°/12 = 30°. The area of one triangle is (1/2) r^2 sin 30°. So total area of 12 triangles (which equals the area of the circle sector decomposition) is 12 × (1/2) r^2 sin 30° = 6 r^2 sin 30°. With sin 30° = 1/2, total area = 3 r^2. A square of side r has area r^2. Using all triangles exactly once, the total area 3 r^2 can form at most 3 such squares. Therefore number of squares = 3. Number of triangles per square = total triangles / number of squares = 12 / 3 = 4. So the pair is (3, 4), which matches option A."
