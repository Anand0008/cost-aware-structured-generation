        "reasoning": "Based on area conservation: each of the 12 congruent isosceles triangles (with vertex at circle center) has area $\\frac{r^2}{4}$, so total area $3r^2$. A square of side $r$ has area $r^2$, thus 3 squares can be formed. Since all triangles are used once, triangles per square $= 12 / 3 = 4$. Geometrically, four such triangles can be arranged to form a square, e.g., by pairing into rectangles. The answer key matches this analysis."
