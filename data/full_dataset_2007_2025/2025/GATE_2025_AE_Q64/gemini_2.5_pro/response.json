The fuel mass flow rate is negligible, so the mass flow rate through the engine is constant ($\\dot{m}_a = \\dot{m}_e$). The thrust ($F$) is calculated using the momentum thrust equation: $F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0)$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate ambient speed of sound ($a_0$) and flight velocity ($V_0$).**\nGiven: $T_0 = 260\\text{ K}$, $R = 287\\text{ J/kg/K}$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, $M_0 = 3$.\n$a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287\\text{ J/kg/K} \\times 260\\text{ K}} = \\sqrt{104468}\\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2 = 323.215\\text{ m/s}$.\n$V_0 = M_0 a_0 = 3 \\times 323.215\\text{ m/s} = 969.645\\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate stagnation pressure at the combustor inlet ($p_{01}$).**\nFor isentropic compression in the diffuser:\n$\\frac{p_{01}}{p_0} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} \\times 3^2\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{1.4-1}}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times \\left(1 + 0.2 \\times 9\\right)^{3.5} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times (2.8)^{3.5}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times 37.039 = 2222.34\\text{ kPa}$.\nFor an ideal ramjet, combustion occurs at constant stagnation pressure, so $p_{02} = p_{01} = 2222.34\\text{ kPa}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate nozzle exit Mach number ($M_e$).**\nThe nozzle expands the gas isentropically from $p_{02}$ to $p_e = p_0 = 60\\text{ kPa}$.\n$\\frac{p_{02}}{p_e} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n$\\frac{2222.34\\text{ kPa}}{60\\text{ kPa}} = \\left(1 + 0.2 M_e^2\\right)^{3.5}$\n$37.039 = \\left(1 + 0.2 M_e^2\\right)^{3.5}$\n$(37.039)^{1/3.5} = 1 + 0.2 M_e^2$\n$2.8 = 1 + 0.2 M_e^2$\n$1.8 = 0.2 M_e^2 \\implies M_e^2 = 9 \\implies M_e = 3$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate exit speed of sound ($a_e$) and exit velocity ($V_e$).**\nGiven: $T_e = 700\\text{ K}$.\n$a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287\\text{ J/kg/K} \\times 700\\text{ K}} = \\sqrt{281260}\\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2 = 530.339\\text{ m/s}$.\n$V_e = M_e a_e = 3 \\times 530.339\\text{ m/s} = 1591.017\\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the thrust ($F$).**\nGiven: $\\dot{m}_a = 50\\text{ kg/s}$.\n$F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0) = 50\\text{ kg/s} \\times (1591.017\\text{ m/s} - 969.645\\text{ m/s})$\n$F = 50\\text{ kg/s} \\times 621.372\\text{ m/s} = 31068.6\\text{ N}$.\n$F = 31.0686\\text{ kN}$.\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, $F = 31.1\\text{ kN}$.

          "name": "Using Stagnation Temperature Ratios",
          "description": "Instead of calculating static temperatures and Mach numbers at the exit, one could use stagnation temperature ratios across the combustor and isentropic relations for stagnation temperature to static temperature to find $T_e$. However, the problem directly gives $T_e$, simplifying this. If $T_e$ was not given, one would need $T_{02}$ (stagnation temperature after combustion) and then use $\\frac{T_{02}}{T_e} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Can be more direct if stagnation temperatures are readily available. Cons: Requires additional steps if only static temperatures are known. In this problem, the given $T_e$ makes the direct approach simpler.",

These were highly relevant and directly used in the solution. Chunks 4 and 5 were less directly applicable to the specific calculation but provided good contextual information on ramjet operation."
