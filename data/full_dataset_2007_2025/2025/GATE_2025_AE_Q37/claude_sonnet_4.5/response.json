To determine this, we need to find the minimum cross-sectional area required to support the axial load, which is governed by the yield strength of the material.

Comparing the given properties, material $\\beta$ has the highest yield strength (900 MPa) and a relatively low density (4500 kg/m^3), leading to the lowest weight design.
