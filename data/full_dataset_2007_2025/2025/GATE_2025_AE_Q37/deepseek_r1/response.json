        "reasoning": "The question asks for the material resulting in the lowest weight for a tensile rod designed using a strength-based failure criterion. This requires minimizing the cross-sectional area needed to carry load P without exceeding the yield strength. The weight W = ρ * A * L. The required area A = P / σ_y (from σ = P/A ≤ σ_y). Therefore, W = (ρ/σ_y) * P * L. For fixed P and L, weight is proportional to (ρ/σ_y). The material with the smallest (ρ/σ_y) (or highest specific strength σ_y/ρ) gives the lightest rod. Calculating ρ/σ_y for each material: α: 2700/270e6 = 1.00e-5, β: 4500/900e6 = 0.50e-5, γ: 7800/520e6 ≈ 1.50e-5, δ: 9000/540e6 ≈ 1.67e-5. Material β has the smallest ratio (0.50e-5), hence the lowest weight."
