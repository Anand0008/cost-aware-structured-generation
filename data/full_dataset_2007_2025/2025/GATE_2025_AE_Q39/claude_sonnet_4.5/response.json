The glide velocity $V_g$ increases with increasing altitude when all other parameters remain constant. This is because the air density $\\rho_\\infty$ decreases with increasing altitude, and the equilibrium glide velocity equation shows that $V_g$ is inversely proportional to the square root of $\\rho_\\infty$.\n\nStatements B and C are incorrect:\nB.

This is because the equilibrium glide velocity equation shows that $V_g$ is proportional to the square root of W/S.\nC.
