        "reasoning": "Statement A is TRUE: The condition for minimum glide angle (shallowest descent) is achieved when the aircraft operates at its maximum lift-to-drag ratio, $(L/D)_{max}$. Therefore, the glide speed $V_g$ at minimum glide angle is indeed the speed corresponding to the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. This is a fundamental principle for maximizing glide range.\n\nStatement B is FALSE: The equilibrium glide velocity is given by $V_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S)\\cos{\\theta}}{\\rho_{\\infty} C_L}}$. Assuming other parameters (like $\\cos{\\theta}$, $\\rho_{\\infty}$, $C_L$) remain constant, $V_g$ is directly proportional to the square root of the wing loading $(W/S)$. Thus, decreasing wing loading would decrease $V_g$, not increase it.\n\nStatement C is FALSE: Altitude affects air density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$). Decreasing altitude means increasing air density. Since $V_g$ is inversely proportional to the square root of air density ($V_g \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho_{\\infty}}$), decreasing altitude would lead to a decrease in $V_g$, not an increase.\n\nStatement D is TRUE: Increasing altitude means decreasing air density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$). As $V_g$ is inversely proportional to the square root of air density, increasing altitude (and thus decreasing $\\rho_{\\infty}$) would lead to an increase in $V_g$."

For minimum glide angle, $\\theta$ is typically small, so $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$.",
