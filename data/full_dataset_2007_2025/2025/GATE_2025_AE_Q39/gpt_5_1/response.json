From Anderson and the RAG: for equilibrium glide,\n1) Along flight path: D = W \\sin\\theta\n2) Normal to path: L = W \\cos\\theta\nSo \\tan\\theta = D/L = 1/(L/D). Minimum \\theta occurs at maximum L/D. The speed at which the airplane is flown when it is at minimum glide angle is therefore exactly the speed corresponding to (L/D)_max. Hence statement A is true.\nFor the equilibrium glide speed,\nL = W \\cos\\theta = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V_g^2 S C_L\n\\Rightarrow V_g = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2(W/S)\\cos\\theta}{\\rho C_L}}.\nAt minimum glide angle, C_L is fixed at the value corresponding to (L/D)_max, and \\theta is small so \\cos\\theta \\approx 1. Thus, for a given airplane at that condition,\nV_g \\propto \\sqrt{\\dfrac{W/S}{\\rho}}.\nWing loading W/S is held constant in options C and D; only altitude (hence density \\rho) changes. As altitude increases, air density \\rho decreases, so V_g increases. Therefore, statement D (V_g increases with increasing altitude) is true, and statement C (increases with decreasing altitude, i.e., higher density) is false.\nFor statement B, with all other parameters constant and at fixed C_L = C_{L,(L/D)_{max}}, V_g \\propto \\sqrt{W/S}. Decreasing wing loading reduces V_g, not increases it. So B is false.\nThus the correct options are A and D, matching the official key."
