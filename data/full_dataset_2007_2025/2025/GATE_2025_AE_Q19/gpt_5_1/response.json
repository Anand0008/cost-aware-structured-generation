        "reasoning": "For a positively cambered airfoil, thin airfoil theory and experiments show: (1) It has a negative zero-lift angle of attack, so at \\(\\alpha_{L=0}\\) the airfoil is slightly nose-down relative to the free stream. (2) The pitching moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center (near quarter-chord) is constant with angle of attack and negative (nose-down) for conventional positive camber. Taking nose-up as positive, a negative moment is represented by a clockwise arrow about the aerodynamic center. Therefore, the correct schematic must show: (i) the airfoil set at a small negative geometric angle of attack relative to \\(U_{\\infty}\\) (chord line slightly downward), and (ii) a clockwise moment vector about a point near the quarter-chord, not at the trailing edge or leading edge. Among the given options, Diagram A shows the airfoil at a small negative angle of attack with a clockwise moment about a point near the quarter-chord, matching the physical situation. Other diagrams either show the wrong sign of moment (counterclockwise, i.e., nose-up) or the wrong angle of attack (zero or positive) or a moment about the trailing edge. Hence option A is the only accurate representation."
