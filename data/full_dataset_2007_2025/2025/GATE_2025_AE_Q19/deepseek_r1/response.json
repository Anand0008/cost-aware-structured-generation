        "reasoning": "A positively cambered airfoil has a negative zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0} < 0$). At this angle, the lift coefficient $C_l = 0$, but the pitching moment about the aerodynamic center ($C_{m_{ac}}$) is constant and independent of angle of attack. For conventional positively cambered airfoils, $C_{m_{ac}}$ is negative (nose-down moment). Since net lift is zero, the moment is a pure couple with the same value about any point. A nose-down moment corresponds to a clockwise rotational tendency when viewing the airfoil from the left (leading edge left, trailing edge right). Diagram A likely depicts this clockwise (nose-down) moment direction, while option B described a counterclockwise moment around the trailing edge, which would be nose-up and incorrect."

When viewing the airfoil from the left (typical diagram with leading edge left), this corresponds to a clockwise rotational arrow around the airfoil. Diagram A must show this clockwise direction, while option B (counterclockwise around trailing edge) would indicate a nose-up moment, which is incorrect."
