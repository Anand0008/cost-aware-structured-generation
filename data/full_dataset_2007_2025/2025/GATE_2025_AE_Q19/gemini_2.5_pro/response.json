        "reasoning": "A positively cambered airfoil is characterized by its ability to generate lift even at zero angle of attack. To achieve *zero lift*, such an airfoil must be pitched nose-down relative to the freestream, meaning its zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) is negative. This is because the inherent curvature (camber) creates a downward deflection of air, which needs to be counteracted by a negative angle of attack to nullify the lift. Furthermore, a cambered airfoil inherently produces a non-zero pitching moment about its aerodynamic center ($C_{m_{ac}}$), which is typically negative (nose-down, or clockwise in standard aerodynamic convention when the reference point is near the leading edge) and is constant with angle of attack. Therefore, at the zero-lift angle of attack, there will still be a non-zero, nose-down pitching moment.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   **Diagram A:** Shows a positively cambered airfoil. The freestream velocity $U_{\\infty}$ is oriented such that the chord line is at a negative angle relative to $U_{\\infty}$, which is consistent with the negative zero-lift angle of attack for a positively cambered airfoil. The pitching moment $M$ is shown as clockwise, representing a nose-down moment, which is also consistent with the inherent pitching moment of a cambered airfoil. This diagram accurately describes the scenario.\n*   **Diagram B:** Shows a positive angle of attack and a counter-clockwise (nose-up) moment. Both are incorrect for the specified conditions.\n*   **Diagram C:** Shows zero angle of attack (chord line aligned with $U_{\\infty}$). At $\\alpha=0$, a positively cambered airfoil generates positive lift, not zero lift. While the moment direction is correct, the angle of attack is not for the zero-lift condition.\n*   **Diagram D:** Shows a symmetric airfoil (mean camber line coincides with the chord line). The question specifies a *positively cambered* airfoil. Also, a symmetric airfoil at zero lift (which occurs at $\\alpha=0$) has zero pitching moment about its aerodynamic center. Thus, this diagram is incorrect on multiple counts."
