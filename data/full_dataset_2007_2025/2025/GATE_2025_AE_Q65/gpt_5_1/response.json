It did not give this exact problem, but the relations R = (φ/2)(tanβ1 + tanβ2) and ψ = φ(tanβ1 − tanβ2) are consistent with standard texts and were crucial. Some chunks were about turbines or general gas turbines but still conceptually related. Detailed numerical steps relied mainly on internal knowledge."
