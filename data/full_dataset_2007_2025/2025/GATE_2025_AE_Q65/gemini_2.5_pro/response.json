This involves using the definition of the degree of reaction and the specific work input, both expressed in terms of velocity triangle angles and thermodynamic properties. Since no efficiency is provided, it is a standard assumption in such GATE problems to consider the compression process as ideal (isentropic) for calculating the temperature rise corresponding to the given pressure ratio.

Unknown: Rotor blade angle at the outlet ($\beta_2$).",

The isentropic total temperature at the outlet ($T_{02s}$) is given by $T_{02s} = T_{01} \\times (r_p)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$.",

          "Step 4: Relate the specific work to the velocity triangle angles. For an axial compressor, the specific work can also be expressed using the Euler turbomachinery equation and velocity triangles as $W_{stage} = u \\times C_a \\times (\\tan\\beta_1 - \\tan\\beta_2)$, where $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are the relative flow angles at the rotor inlet and outlet, respectively.",
          "Step 5: Use the definition of the degree of reaction in terms of angles. For an axial compressor stage with constant axial velocity, the degree of reaction is given by $R = \\frac{C_a}{2u} (\\tan\\beta_1 + \\tan\\beta_2)$.",
          "Step 6: Formulate a system of two equations with two unknowns ($\\tan\\beta_1$ and $\\tan\\beta_2$) and solve for $\\tan\\beta_2$. Equate the specific work expressions from Step 3 and Step 4 to get one equation, and use the degree of reaction equation from Step 5 as the second equation. Solve these simultaneously.",

    "question_text": "A single-stage axial compressor, with a 50 % degree of reaction, runs at a mean blade speed of 250 m/s. The overall pressure ratio developed is 1.3. Inlet pressure and temperature are 1 bar and 300 K, respectively. Axial velocity is 200 m/s. Specific heat at constant pressure, $C_p = 1005$ J/kg/K and specific heat ratio, $\\gamma = 1.4$. The rotor blade angle at the outlet is ___ degrees (rounded off to two decimal places)."
