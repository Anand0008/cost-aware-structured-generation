        "reasoning": "For an ideal two-stage rocket with identical specific impulse, identical structural coefficient, and optimized design, the payload ratio (payload mass divided by initial mass of that stage) is the same for both stages. Here, the final payload is 2 tons and the initial mass of the whole rocket is 200 tons. Let m1 be the initial mass of stage 1 and m2 be the initial mass of stage 2 (which is also the mass of the second stage including payload at the start of its burn). Then m1 + m2 = 200. Identical payload ratio means: (payload of stage 1)/(m1) = (payload of stage 2)/(m2). The payload of stage 2 is the final payload, 2 tons. The payload of stage 1 is the entire second stage (including payload), i.e., m2. Thus, m2/m1 = 2/m2. This gives m2^2 = 2 m1. Using m1 = 200 - m2, we get m2^2 = 2(200 - m2) = 400 - 2 m2, or m2^2 + 2 m2 - 400 = 0. Solving the quadratic: m2 = [-2 + sqrt(4 + 1600)]/2 = [-2 + sqrt(1604)]/2 ≈ (-2 + 40.05)/2 ≈ 19.0 ≈ 20 tons. Among the options, 20 tons (option C) is the correct choice. This matches the official key."
