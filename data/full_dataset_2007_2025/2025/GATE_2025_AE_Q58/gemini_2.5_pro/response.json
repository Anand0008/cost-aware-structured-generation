        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio $\\left(\\frac{{l}}{{a}}\\right)$ when the critical value of the compressive force $P$ for yielding and for buckling of the column are equal. This requires calculating both critical loads and equating them.\n\n1.  **Critical Load for Yielding ($P_y$):**\n    The critical load for yielding occurs when the axial stress in the column reaches the uniaxial yield stress of the material.\n    $P_y = \\sigma_y A$\n    Given cross-section dimensions are $a \\times 0.5a$. Therefore, the cross-sectional area $A = a \\times 0.5a = 0.5a^2$.\n    Given uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y = 400 \\text{ MPa} = 400 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}$.\n    $P_y = (400 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}) \\times (0.5a^2) = 200 \\times 10^6 a^2 \\text{ N}$\n\n2.  **Critical Load for Buckling ($P_{cr}$):**\n    The critical load for elastic buckling is given by Euler's buckling formula:\n    $P_{cr} = \\frac{{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}}{{L_e^2}}$\n    *   **End Conditions and Effective Length ($L_e$):** The column is rigidly fixed at the bottom and free at the top. This is a cantilever (fixed-free) boundary condition. For this condition, the effective length factor $K=2$. The effective length $L_e = K l = 2l$.\n    *   **Minimum Moment of Inertia ($I_{min}$):** For a rectangular cross-section with dimensions $b$ and $h$, the moment of inertia is $I = \\frac{1}{12} b h^3$. The column will buckle about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia (the 'weakest' axis).\n        For the given cross-section $a \\times 0.5a$:\n        If $b=a$ and $h=0.5a$, then $I_1 = \\frac{1}{12} a (0.5a)^3 = \\frac{1}{12} a (0.125a^3) = \\frac{0.125}{12} a^4 = \\frac{1}{96} a^4$.\n        If $b=0.5a$ and $h=a$, then $I_2 = \\frac{1}{12} (0.5a) a^3 = \\frac{0.5}{12} a^4 = \\frac{1}{24} a^4$.\n        Comparing $I_1$ and $I_2$, $I_{min} = \\frac{1}{96} a^4$.\n    *   **Euler's Critical Buckling Load Calculation:**\n        Given Young's modulus $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$.\n        $P_{cr} = \\frac{{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}) (\\frac{1}{96} a^4)}}{{(2l)^2}} = \\frac{{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9) a^4}}{{96 \\times 4l^2}} = \\frac{{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9) a^4}}{{384l^2}}$\n\n3.  **Equating $P_y$ and $P_{cr}$:**\n    $P_y = P_{cr}$\n    $200 \\times 10^6 a^2 = \\frac{{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9) a^4}}{{384l^2}}$\n    Divide both sides by $200 \\times 10^6$:\n    $a^2 = \\frac{{\\pi^2 (1000) a^4}}{{384l^2}}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\left(\\frac{{l}}{{a}}\\right)$:\n    $\\frac{{l^2}}{{a^2}} = \\frac{{\\pi^2 \\times 1000}}{{384}}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{{l}}{{a}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{{1000 \\pi^2}}{{384}} \\approx \\frac{{1000 \\times (3.14159)^2}}{{384}} \\approx \\frac{{1000 \\times 9.8696}}{{384}} \\approx \\frac{{9869.6}}{{384}} \\approx 25.7019$\n    $\\frac{{l}}{{a}} = \\sqrt{{25.7019}} \\approx 5.0697$\n\n4.  **Rounding:** Rounding off to one decimal place, $\\frac{{l}}{{a}} \\approx 5.1$.\n    This value falls within the specified range of 5.0 to 5.1."
