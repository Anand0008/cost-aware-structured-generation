Buckling load for a cantilever (fixed-free) column is given by Euler as $P_{cr} = \\dfrac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{(2l)^2} = \\dfrac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{4l^2}$, where $I_{min}$ is the smaller second moment of area. For sides $a$ and $0.5a$, the weaker axis is about the centroidal axis parallel to the longer side, giving $I_{min} = \\dfrac{b h^3}{12} = \\dfrac{a (0.5a)^3}{12} = \\dfrac{a^4}{96}$. Setting $P_y = P_{cr}$: $0.5\\sigma_y a^2 = \\dfrac{\\pi^2 E a^4}{384 l^2}$.
