        "reasoning": "For thin-walled single-cell closed sections under pure torsion, the shear flow is approximately uniform and given by $q = T/(2A_m)$, where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the mean line. With strength as the only criterion and same material and thickness, both designs fail when the maximum shear stress (and hence maximum shear flow) reaches the same allowable value $q_{\\max} = \\tau_{\\text{allow}} t$. Thus $T_{\\max} = 2 A_m q_{\\max}$ and the torque capacity is directly proportional to the enclosed area $A_m$. The ratio of maximum torques is therefore $T_B/T_A = A_{m,B}/A_{m,A}$. From the figure, Design A is a \"racetrack\" shape: a rectangle of length 4 cm and height 2 cm with a semicircular nose of radius 1 cm at the left and a flat end at the right. Design B has the same semicircular nose and overall 4 cm length and 2 cm height, but the aft end is tapered to a point 2 cm behind the rectangle, increasing the enclosed area. Computing the areas using the given dimensions (rectangle plus semicircle for A; rectangle plus semicircle plus isosceles triangle for B) gives $A_{m,A} \\approx 8 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi (1)^2$ and $A_{m,B} \\approx 8 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi (1)^2 + 2$, leading to $T_B/T_A \\approx (10 + 0.5\\pi)/(8 + 0.5\\pi) \\approx 1.21$.

For a given allowable shear stress $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$ and same thickness $t$, $q_{\\max}$ is the same for both designs.",
          "Step 3: Therefore, the maximum torque each design can carry is $T_{\\max} = 2 A_m q_{\\max}$, so the ratio of torque capacities is $T_B/T_A = A_{m,B}/A_{m,A}$. We only need the ratio of enclosed areas.",
          "Step 4: From the figure, Design A consists of a 4 cm by 2 cm rectangle plus a semicircular nose of radius 1 cm. Its enclosed area is $A_{m,A} = 4 \\times 2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = 8 + 0.5\\pi$ (cm$^2$).",

Its area is $A_{\\text{tail}} = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2$ cm$^2$. Thus $A_{m,B} = 8 + 0.5\\pi + 2 = 10 + 0.5\\pi$ (cm$^2$).",
          "Step 6: Compute the ratio $T_B/T_A = A_{m,B}/A_{m,A} = (10 + 0.5\\pi)/(8 + 0.5\\pi)$. Using $\\pi \\approx 3.1416$, $0.5\\pi \\approx 1.5708$, so $A_{m,A} \\approx 9.5708$ and $A_{m,B} \\approx 11.5708$. The ratio is $11.5708/9.5708 \\approx 1.21$.",

With strength as the only criterion for failure, the ratio of maximum torque that B can support to the maximum torque that A can support is__ (rounded off to two decimal places)."
