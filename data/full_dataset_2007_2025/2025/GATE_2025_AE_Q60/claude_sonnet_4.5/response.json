Recognize that the question is asking for the ratio of the maximum torque that Design B can support to the maximum torque that Design A can support.\n2. For thin-walled closed sections under torsion, the torsional stiffness (and hence the maximum torque) is proportional to the square of the enclosed area (A_m^2). \n3. From the given dimensions, the enclosed area for Design A is 4 cm x 2 cm = 8 cm^2, while the enclosed area for Design B is also 4 cm x 2 cm = 8 cm^2.\n4. Since the enclosed areas are the same for both designs, the ratio of their maximum torques will be 1.0.\n5. However, the question states that 'strength as the only criterion for failure', which implies that the torsional strength (or maximum shear stress) is the limiting factor.\n6. The maximum shear stress in a thin-walled closed section under torsion is inversely proportional to the wall thickness (t). \n7. Since both designs have the same wall thickness of 1 mm, the ratio of their maximum torques will be proportional to the ratio of their wall thicknesses, which is 1.0.\n8. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum torque that Design B can support to the maximum torque that Design A can support is 1.0, or 1.00 rounded to two decimal places."
