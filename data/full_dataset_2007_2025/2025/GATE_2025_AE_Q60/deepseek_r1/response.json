It involves understanding the relationship between torque, shear stress, and geometry for thin-walled sections, and requires multiple steps to calculate the area enclosed by each section. Since it requires understanding of multiple concepts and has a multi-step solution, the difficulty is medium and GPT-5.1 is recommended.",
