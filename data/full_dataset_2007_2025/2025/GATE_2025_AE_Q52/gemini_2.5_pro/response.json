This requires applying the force balance equations for climbing flight, calculating the total drag coefficient using the drag polar equation, and then combining these to find the required ratio.

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the flight condition and force balance.** The airplane is in steady climbing flight. For steady flight, the net forces are zero. With thrust (T) aligned with the flight path, the force balance equations are: along the flight path: $T - D - W \\sin\\gamma = 0$; perpendicular to the flight path: $L - W \\cos\\gamma = 0$, where $D$ is drag, $L$ is lift, $W$ is weight, and $\\gamma$ is the climb angle.",
          "**Step 2: Calculate the climb angle ($\\gamma$).** The rate of climb (R/C) is related to the airplane's speed (V) and climb angle by $R/C = V \\sin\\gamma$. Given $R/C = 10 \\text{ m/s}$ and $V = 80 \\text{ m/s}$, calculate $\\sin\\gamma = R/C / V$. Then, find $\\cos\\gamma = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\gamma}$.",
          "**Step 3: Calculate the total drag coefficient ($C_D$).** Use the drag polar equation: $C_D = C_{D,0} + \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}$. Substitute the given zero-lift drag coefficient ($C_{D,0} = 0.02$), lift coefficient ($C_L = 0.8$), Oswald efficiency factor ($e = 0.8$), and aspect ratio ($AR = 6$).",
          "**Step 4: Calculate the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$).** Once $C_D$ is found, calculate $L/D = C_L / C_D$.",
          "**Step 5: Derive the thrust-to-weight ratio ($T/W$).** From the force balance equations, we have $T = D + W \\sin\\gamma$ and $L = W \\cos\\gamma$. From the second equation, $W = L / \\cos\\gamma$. Substitute this into the first equation: $T = D + (L/\\cos\\gamma) \\sin\\gamma$. Divide the entire equation by $W$ to get $\\frac{T}{W} = \\frac{D}{W} + \\sin\\gamma$. Now, substitute $D/W = (D/L) \\times (L/W) = (D/L) \\times \\cos\\gamma$. So, the final expression for the thrust-to-weight ratio is $\\frac{T}{W} = \\frac{1}{L/D} \\cos\\gamma + \\sin\\gamma$.",
          "**Step 6: Substitute values and calculate.** Plug in the calculated values for $\\sin\\gamma$, $\\cos\\gamma$, and $L/D$ into the $T/W$ formula. Perform the calculation and round the final answer to one decimal place as requested."
