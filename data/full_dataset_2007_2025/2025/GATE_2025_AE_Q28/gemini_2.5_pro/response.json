        "reasoning": "To determine the body forces required for a given stress field to satisfy equilibrium, we must use the differential equations of equilibrium for a 3D body. These equations are:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\tau_{xz}}{\\partial z} + X = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial\\tau_{yx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\tau_{yz}}{\\partial z} + Y = 0$\n3.  $\\frac{\\partial\\tau_{zx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\tau_{zy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} + Z = 0$\n\nGiven stress field:\n$\\sigma_{xx} = C_1 y$\n$\\sigma_{yy} = C_2 y$\n$\\sigma_{zz} = C_1 y$\n$\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yz} = \\tau_{zx} = 0$\n\nFirst, calculate the partial derivatives of the given stress components:\n$\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(C_1 y) = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(C_2 y) = C_2$\n$\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(C_1 y) = 0$\n\nSince all shear stress components ($\\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{yz}, \\tau_{zx}$) are zero, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate will also be zero. Also, by the principle of complementary shear stresses ($\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$, etc.), all other shear stress components are also zero.\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives into the equilibrium equations:\n1.  $0 + 0 + 0 + X = 0 \\implies X = 0$\n2.  $0 + C_2 + 0 + Y = 0 \\implies Y = -C_2$\n3.  $0 + 0 + 0 + Z = 0 \\implies Z = 0$\n\nThe body force components are $X=0$, $Y=-C_2$, and $Z=0$. Since $C_2$ is a non-zero constant, the body force in the y-direction ($Y$) is a constant non-zero value. The body forces in the x and z directions are zero. Therefore, there is a constant body force per unit volume only in the y-direction. This matches option B."
