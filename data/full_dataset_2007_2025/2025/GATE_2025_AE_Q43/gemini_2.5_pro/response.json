        "reasoning": "The given ordinary differential equation is a first-order linear differential equation. It can be solved using the integrating factor method. First, rewrite the equation in the standard form $\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + P(x)y = Q(x)$. The given equation is $\\frac{{1}}{{2}} \\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + \\frac{{y}}{{x}} = 1$. Multiplying by 2, we get $\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + \\frac{{2y}}{{x}} = 2$. Here, $P(x) = \\frac{{2}}{{x}}$ and $Q(x) = 2$. The integrating factor (IF) is $e^{\\int P(x) dx} = e^{\\int \\frac{{2}}{{x}} dx} = e^{2 \\ln|x|} = e^{\\ln(x^2)} = x^2$. Multiplying the standard form by the IF, we get $\\frac{{d}}{{dx}}(y \\cdot x^2) = 2x^2$. Integrating both sides yields $yx^2 = \\int 2x^2 dx = \\frac{{2x^3}}{{3}} + C$. Thus, the general solution is $y = \\frac{{2x}}{{3}} + \\frac{{C}}{{x^2}}$. Using the initial condition $y(1) = 2/3$: $\\frac{{2}}{{3}} = \\frac{{2(1)}}{{3}} + \\frac{{C}}{{(1)^2}} \\implies \\frac{{2}}{{3}} = \\frac{{2}}{{3}} + C \\implies C = 0$. The particular solution is $y = \\frac{{2x}}{{3}}$. Finally, to find $y$ at $x=3$: $y(3) = \\frac{{2(3)}}{{3}} = 2$. Rounded off to the nearest integer, the value is 2."

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided general information on ODEs (uniqueness, numerical methods, power series, homogeneous equations) but did not directly offer the integrating factor method for linear first-order ODEs, which is the most direct and efficient approach for this problem. Chunk 6 discussed first-order homogeneous ODEs, which is a different specific type. I primarily relied on internal knowledge for the specific solution method."
