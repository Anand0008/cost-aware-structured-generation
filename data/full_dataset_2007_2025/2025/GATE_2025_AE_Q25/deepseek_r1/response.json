This requires that the slope of the pitching moment coefficient versus angle of attack curve is negative (\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0). This condition is achieved when the center of gravity (CG) is forward of the neutral point (NP), making the static margin positive. Option A states CG aft of NP, which leads to instability. Option C claims \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} is positive, which indicates instability. Option D says static margin is negative, which also implies instability.
