        "reasoning": "The question asks for the condition that should be satisfied to achieve longitudinal static stability of a general aviation airplane. According to the principles of longitudinal static stability, for an aircraft to be statically stable, the center of gravity (CG) must be located forward of the neutral point (NP). This ensures that the slope of the pitching moment coefficient curve (∂C_m/∂α) is negative, which is the condition for static stability. Option B, 'The center of gravity of the airplane should be forward of the neutral point,' correctly describes this requirement. Options A, C, and D are incorrect, as they do not represent the necessary condition for longitudinal static stability."
