This is a standard result derived from the general strain energy expression for bending: $U = \\int_0^L \\frac{M(x)^2}{2EI} dx$, where $M(x) = Px$ (with x measured from the free end). The integration yields option A. The provided RAG context (Chunk 1) explicitly confirms this derivation and result.
