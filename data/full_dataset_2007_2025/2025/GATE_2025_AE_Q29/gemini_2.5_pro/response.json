The strain energy due to bending ($U$) is given by the integral of $\\frac{M^2}{2EI}$ over the length of the beam. For a cantilever beam with a point load $P$ at the free end, if we measure the distance $x$ from the free end towards the fixed end, the bending moment $M(x)$ at any section is $Px$. Substituting this into the strain energy formula and integrating from $0$ to $L$: \\n$U = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{(Px)^2}{2EI} dx$ \\n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\int_{0}^{L} x^2 dx$ \\n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{L}$ \\n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{3} - 0\\right)$ \\n$U = \\frac{P^2 L^3}{6EI}$ \\nThis result matches option A."
