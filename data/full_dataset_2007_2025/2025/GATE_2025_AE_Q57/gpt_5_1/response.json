For small rotation \\(\\theta\\) about the hinge, the right end moves vertically by \\(y_G = L\\theta\\). The spring force is \\(F_s = k y_G = k L \\theta\\), giving a restoring moment about F: \\(M_s = F_s L = k L^2 \\theta\\). This is an equivalent rotational stiffness \\(K_\\theta = k L^2\\). The bar is uniform, so its mass moment of inertia about the hinge at one end is \\(I_F = \\frac{1}{3} m L^2\\). The rotational equation of motion is \\(I_F \\ddot{\\theta} + K_\\theta \\theta = 0\\). Thus \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K_\\theta / I_F} = \\sqrt{(k L^2) / (\\tfrac{1}{3} m L^2)} = \\sqrt{3k/m}\\).
