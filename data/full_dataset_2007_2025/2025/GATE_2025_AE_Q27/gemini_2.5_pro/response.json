To determine the vertical reaction forces, we use the principles of static equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total resultant force (W) of the distributed load:**\n    The distributed load forms a triangle with base $L$ and height $q_0$. The area of this triangle represents the total resultant force.\n    $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times q_0$\n\n2.  **Locate the point of application of the resultant force (centroid of the triangle):**\n    For a triangular load, the centroid is located at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the base from the side with the maximum intensity (the 'heavy' end) and $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the base from the side with zero intensity (the 'light' end).\n    In this case, the maximum intensity $q_0$ is at A. So, the resultant force $W$ acts at a distance of $\\frac{1}{3}L$ from support A (or $\\frac{2}{3}L$ from support B).\n\n3.  **Apply the equations of static equilibrium:**\n    Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the vertical reaction forces at supports A and B, respectively.\n    *   **Sum of vertical forces:**\n        $\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B - W = 0$\n        $R_A + R_B = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L \\quad (Equation~1)$\n\n    *   **Sum of moments about support A:** (Taking counter-clockwise moments as positive)\n        $\\sum M_A = 0 \\implies R_B \\times L - W \\times (\\frac{1}{3}L) = 0$\n        Substitute $W = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L$:\n        $R_B \\times L - (\\frac{1}{2} q_0 L) \\times (\\frac{1}{3}L) = 0$\n        $R_B \\times L = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L^2$\n        $R_B = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n\n4.  **Solve for $R_A$ using Equation 1:**\n    $R_A = W - R_B = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L - \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n    $R_A = (\\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}) q_0 L = \\frac{2}{6} q_0 L = \\frac{1}{3} q_0 L$\n\n5.  **Compare the magnitudes of the reaction forces:**\n    $R_A = \\frac{1}{3} q_0 L$\n    $R_B = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{3} > \\frac{1}{6}$, it is clear that $R_A > R_B$.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the vertical reaction force at A is larger than that at B.

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided comprehensive information on simply supported beams with uniformly distributed loads, including reaction calculations, SFD, BMD, and deflection. While the specific load type in the question (triangular) was not directly addressed, the fundamental principles of static equilibrium and resultant force calculation, which are prerequisites for the RAG content, are directly applicable. The RAG context implicitly supports the need to correctly determine support reactions for any distributed load, making it moderately relevant for the underlying principles."
