        "reasoning": "The beam is simply supported at A (pin) and B (roller). The transverse load varies linearly from a maximum value q_0 at A to zero at B, forming a right triangular distributed load with base length L and height q_0. The resultant of a triangular load equals the area of the triangle and acts at its centroid, which is located at one-third of the base length from the larger-intensity end. Therefore, the equivalent point load is \\(Q = \\tfrac{1}{2} q_0 L\\) acting at a distance \\(x = L/3\\) from A (towards B). Taking moments about A: \\(R_B L = Q x = (\\tfrac{1}{2} q_0 L)(L/3) = q_0 L^2 / 6\\), so \\(R_B = q_0 L / 6\\). From vertical force equilibrium: \\(R_A + R_B = Q = q_0 L / 2\\), giving \\(R_A = q_0 L / 2 - q_0 L / 6 = q_0 L / 3\\). Hence \\(R_A = q_0 L / 3\\) and \\(R_B = q_0 L / 6\\), so \\(R_A > R_B\\). Thus option A, stating that the vertical reaction at A is larger than that at B, is correct."
