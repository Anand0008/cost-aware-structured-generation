        "reasoning": "For torsional vibration of a uniform rod, the governing equation is the same as for longitudinal vibration of a bar or torsional wave in a shaft. The natural frequencies depend on the boundary conditions through the eigenvalues. For a fixed-free rod in torsion, the fundamental mode corresponds to a quarter-wave: the length L equals one-quarter of the torsional wavelength, so the fundamental circular frequency is $\\omega_{1,\\text{FF}} = \\dfrac{\\pi C}{2L}$, where $C = \\sqrt{G/\\rho}$ is the torsional wave speed. For a fixed-fixed rod, both ends are nodes of rotation, so the fundamental corresponds to a half-wave over the length: $\\omega_{1,\\text{FFx}} = \\dfrac{\\pi C}{L}$. The ratio is $k = \\dfrac{\\omega_{1,\\text{fixed-fixed}}}{\\omega_{1,\\text{fixed-free}}} = \\dfrac{\\pi C/L}{\\pi C/(2L)} = 2$. Thus k = 2.0, which matches option C and the official key."
