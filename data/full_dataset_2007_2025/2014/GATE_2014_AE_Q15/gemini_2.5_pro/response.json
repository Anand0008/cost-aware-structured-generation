The general form of the natural frequency is $\\omega_n = \\frac{\\beta_n C}{L}$, where $C = \\sqrt{G/\\rho}$ is the torsional wave speed, $G$ is the shear modulus, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $L$ is the length, and $\\beta_n$ is a constant determined by the boundary conditions and mode number $n$.\n\n1.  **Fixed-Fixed Rod:**\n    For a fixed-fixed rod, the boundary conditions are zero twist at both ends: $\\theta(0,t) = 0$ and $\\theta(L,t) = 0$. Applying these to the general solution leads to the frequency equation $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$. This implies $\\frac{\\omega L}{C} = n\\pi$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n    The fundamental natural frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{ff} = \\frac{\\pi C}{L} = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}}$. (This is consistent with RAG Chunk 1).\n\n2.  **Fixed-Free Rod:**\n    For a fixed-free rod, the boundary conditions are zero twist at the fixed end ($\\theta(0,t) = 0$) and zero torque at the free end ($\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}|_{x=L} = 0$). Applying these to the general solution leads to the frequency equation $\\cos(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$.

          "Step 1: Understand the physical system. The problem deals with torsional vibration of a uniform rod, which is a continuous system. The key is to determine the natural frequencies under two different boundary conditions: fixed-fixed and fixed-free.",
          "Step 2: Recall the governing equation for torsional vibration. The torsional wave equation is $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial t^2} = C^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}$, where $\\theta(x,t)$ is the angle of twist, $x$ is the position along the rod, $t$ is time, and $C = \\sqrt{G/\\rho}$ is the torsional wave propagation speed ($G$ is shear modulus, $\\rho$ is mass density).",
          "Step 3: Obtain the general solution for the mode shape. Assuming a harmonic solution $\\theta(x,t) = \\phi(x) \\cos(\\omega t + \\alpha)$, the spatial part $\\phi(x)$ satisfies $\\phi''(x) + (\\omega/C)^2 \\phi(x) = 0$. The general solution is $\\phi(x) = A \\cos(\\frac{\\omega x}{C}) + B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega x}{C})$.",
          "Step 4: Apply boundary conditions for the fixed-fixed rod. At $x=0$, $\\phi(0)=0 \\implies A=0$. At $x=L$, $\\phi(L)=0 \\implies B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$, which means $\\frac{\\omega L}{C} = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The fundamental frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{ff} = \\frac{\\pi C}{L}$.",
          "Step 5: Apply boundary conditions for the fixed-free rod. At $x=0$, $\\phi(0)=0 \\implies A=0$. So, $\\phi(x) = B \\sin(\\frac{\\omega x}{C})$. At $x=L$, the end is free, meaning zero internal torque, which translates to zero slope of the twist angle: $\\phi'(L)=0$. The derivative is $\\phi'(x) = B \\frac{\\omega}{C} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega x}{C})$. Setting $\\phi'(L)=0$ gives $B \\frac{\\omega}{C} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$.

The fundamental frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{ffree} = \\frac{\\pi C}{2L}$.",

However, the RAG context did not provide the formula for a simple fixed-free torsional rod (without an end mass), requiring reliance on internal knowledge for that specific boundary condition. Other RAG chunks were either for longitudinal vibration or torsional vibration with attached masses, which were not directly applicable to the fixed-free case without an end mass."
