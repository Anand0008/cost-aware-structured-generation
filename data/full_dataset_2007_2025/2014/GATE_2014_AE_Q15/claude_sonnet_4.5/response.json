This can be shown by analyzing the frequency equations for the two cases:\n\nFor a fixed-free shaft, the frequency equation is:\ntan(ω*L/C) = (J_0*ω*C)/(G*I_p)\n\nFor a fixed-fixed shaft, the frequency equation is:\ntan(ω*L/C) = -(G*I_p)/(J_0*ω*C)\n\nSolving these equations, the fundamental natural frequency of the fixed-fixed shaft is ω_fixed-fixed = 2*ω_fixed-free, where ω_fixed-free is the fundamental natural frequency of the fixed-free shaft. Therefore, the ratio of the fundamental frequencies is k = 2.0, which matches the correct answer C."
