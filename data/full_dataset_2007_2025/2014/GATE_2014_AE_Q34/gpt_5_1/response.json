For such a case, the pressure at A, p_A, is the critical pressure p_*. The given ratio p_A/p_∞ = 0.8 therefore equals p_*/p_∞.

          "Step 5: Substitute γ = 1.4 and p_* / p_∞ = 0.8 into this expression and solve for M_∞: 0.8 = [ (1 + 0.2 M_∞^2) / 1.2 ]^{3.5}. Taking both sides to the power 1/3.5 gives (1 + 0.2 M_∞^2) / 1.2 ≈ 0.8^{1/3.5}.",
