The specific isentropic pressure ratio formula was not explicitly quoted but could be inferred from the context. The RAG emphasized the definition and importance of critical Mach number, which matches the problem's concept. Chunks 2 and 3 were less directly relevant but provided complementary formulas (pressure coefficient)."
