This is given by:\nC_p,cr = (2 / (γ * M_inf^2)) * [((1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_inf^2) / (1 + (γ-1)/2 * 1^2))^(γ / (γ-1)) - 1]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nC_p,cr = (2 / (1.4 * M_inf^2)) * [((1 + (1.4-1)/2 * M_inf^2) / (1 + (1.4-1)/2 * 1^2))^(1.4 / (1.4-1)) - 1]\nC_p,cr = 0.8\n\nSolving this equation numerically gives M_inf = 0.79, which matches option B."
