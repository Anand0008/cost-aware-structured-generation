        "reasoning": "The lift-off distance ($s_{LO}$) is directly proportional to the square of the aircraft's weight ($W^2$), assuming all other parameters (like air density, wing area, maximum lift coefficient, and thrust) remain constant. This relationship is given by the simplified liftoff distance equation: $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$. If the take-off weight is reduced by 10%, the new weight ($W'$) becomes $0.9W$. The new lift-off distance ($s_{LO}'$) will be proportional to $(0.9W)^2 = 0.81W^2$. Therefore, $s_{LO}' = 0.81 s_{LO}$. The change in lift-off distance is $s_{LO}' - s_{LO} = 0.81 s_{LO} - s_{LO} = -0.19 s_{LO}$. The percentage change is $\\frac{-0.19 s_{LO}}{s_{LO}} \\times 100\\% = -19\\%$.

          "Step 1: Identify the governing relationship for lift-off distance. From aircraft performance principles, the simplified lift-off distance ($s_{LO}$) is proportional to the square of the aircraft's weight ($W$). This can be written as $s_{LO} = k W^2$, where $k$ is a constant incorporating all other parameters (gravity, air density, wing area, maximum lift coefficient, and thrust) which are assumed to remain constant.",
          "Step 2: Define the initial conditions. Let the initial weight be $W_1 = W$ and the initial lift-off distance be $s_{LO,1} = S_{LO}$. So, $S_{LO} = k W^2$.",
          "Step 3: Define the new conditions. The take-off weight is reduced by 10%. Therefore, the new weight $W_2 = W - 0.10W = 0.9W$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the new lift-off distance. Using the same proportionality, the new lift-off distance $s_{LO,2}$ will be $s_{LO,2} = k (W_2)^2 = k (0.9W)^2 = k (0.81W^2)$.",
          "Step 5: Express the new lift-off distance in terms of the initial lift-off distance. Since $S_{LO} = k W^2$, we can substitute this into the expression for $s_{LO,2}$: $s_{LO,2} = 0.81 (k W^2) = 0.81 S_{LO}$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the percentage change in lift-off distance. The change in lift-off distance is $\\Delta s_{LO} = s_{LO,2} - s_{LO,1} = 0.81 S_{LO} - S_{LO} = -0.19 S_{LO}$.",
          "Step 7: Determine the magnitude of the percentage change. Percentage change = $\\frac{\\Delta s_{LO}}{s_{LO,1}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{-0.19 S_{LO}}{S_{LO}} \\times 100\\% = -19\\%$. The magnitude of this change is 19%."
