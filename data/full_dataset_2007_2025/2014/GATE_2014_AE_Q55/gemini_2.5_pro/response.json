        "reasoning": "The rate of climb (R/C) is calculated using the excess power method: $R/C = \\frac{P_{av} - P_R}{W}$. First, we calculate the drag coefficient $C_D = 0.025 + 0.04 C_L^2 = 0.025 + 0.04 (0.65)^2 = 0.025 + 0.0169 = 0.0419$. Since the dynamic pressure $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S$ is not given, we use the lift equation $L = W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S C_L$ to find $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S = \\frac{W}{C_L}$. Substituting this into the drag equation $D = (\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S) C_D$, we get $D = W \\frac{C_D}{C_L} = 13000 \\text{ N} \\times \\frac{0.0419}{0.65} = 838 \\text{ N}$. The power required is $P_R = D V_\\infty = 838 \\text{ N} \\times 40 \\text{ m/s} = 33520 \\text{ W}$. The excess power is $P_{excess} = P_{av} - P_R = 100000 \\text{ W} - 33520 \\text{ W} = 66480 \\text{ W}$. Finally, $R/C = \\frac{P_{excess}}{W} = \\frac{66480 \\text{ W}}{13000 \\text{ N}} = 5.1138 \\text{ m/s}$. This value matches option B."

The goal is to find the rate of climb (R/C).",

For steady flight, Lift (L) equals Weight (W). We know $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S C_L$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S = \\frac{W}{C_L}$. Now, substitute this into the drag equation $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 S C_D$ to get $D = W \\frac{C_D}{C_L}$. Calculate $D = 13000 \\text{ N} \\times \\frac{0.0419}{0.65} = 838 \\text{ N}$.",
