          "Step 1: Identify the governing equation for circular orbital velocity. The velocity $V$ of a spacecraft in a stable circular orbit around a central body is given by the formula $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the central body (moon in this case), and $r$ is the orbital radius measured from the center of the central body.",
          "Step 2: Determine the orbital radius for the first spacecraft. The problem states that $R$ is the radius of the moon. The first spacecraft is orbiting at an altitude of $R$ above the moon's surface. Therefore, its orbital radius from the center of the moon is $r_1 = R_{moon} + h_1 = R + R = 2R$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the orbital radius for the second spacecraft. The second spacecraft is orbiting at an altitude of $2R$ above the moon's surface. Its orbital radius from the center of the moon is $r_2 = R_{moon} + h_2 = R + 2R = 3R$.",
          "Step 4: Express the velocities of the two spacecraft using the orbital velocity formula. For spacecraft 1: $V_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{2R}}$. For spacecraft 2: $V_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{3R}}$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the velocities, $V_1 / V_2$. Divide the expression for $V_1$ by the expression for $V_2$: $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{2R}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{3R}}}$.",
          "Step 6: Simplify the ratio. Combine the square roots and cancel common terms: $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{3R}{GM}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3R}{2R}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
          "Step 7: Compute the numerical value. $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.2247$. This value lies within the acceptable range of 1.2 to 1.25."
