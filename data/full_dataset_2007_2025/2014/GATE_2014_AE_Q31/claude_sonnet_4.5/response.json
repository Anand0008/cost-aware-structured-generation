The pathline equation is obtained by integrating the velocity components over time, starting from an initial position. For the given initial condition $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 2)$, the pathline equation is $x = C_x e^{at}$ and $y = C_y e^{bt}$. Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 2$, we get $C_y = 2$. Since the pathline must pass through the point $(1, 2)$, we can substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 2$ into the pathline equations to solve for $a$ and $b$. This gives $a = 5$ and $b = -5$, which matches the correct answer range of -5.01 to -4.99."
