        "reasoning": "To measure the free-stream velocity ($V$) in a low-speed (incompressible) flow, the fundamental relationship derived from Bernoulli's equation is $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p_0 - p_1)}{\\rho}}$, where $p_0$ is the total (stagnation) pressure, $p_1$ is the static pressure, and $\\rho$ is the air density. Therefore, to determine $V$, both $p_0$ and $p_1$ must be known.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\ni. **Pitot tube alone aligned with the flow direction:** A Pitot tube measures only the total pressure ($p_0$) (Chunk 1, 3, 6). Without a separate measurement of static pressure ($p_1$), the velocity cannot be determined. Thus, statement (i) is incorrect.\n\nii. **Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction with static pressure measurement at an appropriate position on the tunnel wall:** A Pitot tube measures $p_0$. A static pressure port on the tunnel wall, if placed at an 'appropriate position' where the flow is undisturbed, measures $p_1$ (Chunk 3, 6). With both $p_0$ and $p_1$ available, the velocity can be calculated. Thus, statement (ii) is correct.\n\niii. **Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction along with barometer pressure reading of the outside ambient:** A Pitot tube measures $p_0$. A barometer measures the atmospheric pressure outside the wind tunnel. This outside ambient pressure is generally not the static pressure ($p_1$) within the wind tunnel test section, especially in a closed-circuit tunnel or if there are pressure gradients. Therefore, this combination is not reliable for measuring test section velocity. Thus, statement (iii) is incorrect.\n\niv. **Pitot static tube alone aligned with the flow direction:** A Pitot-static tube is a single instrument designed to measure both total pressure ($p_0$) from its forward-facing opening and static pressure ($p_1$) from its side-facing static ports simultaneously (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). With both $p_0$ and $p_1$ directly measured by the instrument, the velocity can be calculated. Thus, statement (iv) is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements (ii) and (iv) are correct, making option C the right choice."
