        "reasoning": "To determine velocity in an incompressible flow, the dynamic pressure $q = p_0 - p$ is needed, which requires measurement of both total pressure $p_0$ and static pressure $p$. Statement (i) provides only total pressure, so velocity cannot be found. Statement (ii) provides total pressure from the Pitot tube and static pressure from a wall port, which is a valid method. Statement (iii) uses outside ambient pressure as static pressure; this is not necessarily equal to the static pressure inside the wind tunnel test section, especially if the tunnel is closed or has pressure gradients, making it unreliable. Statement (iv) uses a Pitot-static tube, which inherently measures both pressures at the same location, making it a standard and valid method. Therefore, only statements (ii) and (iv) are correct."

          "Step 4: Statement (ii): A Pitot tube gives $p_0$. A static pressure port at an appropriate position on the tunnel wall (where flow is parallel and undisturbed) provides a good estimate of freestream static pressure $p$. The difference gives $V$. This is correct.",
          "Step 5: Statement (iii): A Pitot tube gives $p_0$. A barometer reading gives the outside ambient atmospheric pressure, which is not necessarily the static pressure inside the test section. For an open-circuit tunnel, it may be close, but for a closed test section or due to tunnel losses, it can differ. This method is not reliable for accurate velocity measurement and is not standard practice. This is incorrect.",
          "Step 6: Statement (iv): A Pitot-static tube is a single instrument combining a Pitot tube and static ports. When aligned with the flow, it measures both $p_0$ and $p$ at the same location, allowing direct calculation of $V$. This is correct.",
