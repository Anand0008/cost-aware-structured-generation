The basic relation is $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p_0 - p)}{\\rho}}$. A Pitot tube alone (i) gives only total pressure; without static pressure we cannot form $p_0 - p$. Statement (ii): Pitot tube for $p_0$ plus static pressure at an appropriate position on the tunnel wall gives both $p_0$ and $p_\\infty$, so velocity can be computed. Statement (iii): Pitot tube plus outside ambient barometer pressure is not generally valid because the static pressure in the test section need not equal outside ambient (closed-circuit tunnels, contraction effects, etc.). Statement (iv): A Pitot-static tube alone aligned with the flow directly provides both $p_0$ and $p$ (via its static ports), so velocity can be determined. Therefore only (ii) and (iv) are correct, matching option C."

Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction with static pressure measurement at an appropriate position on the tunnel wall. iii. Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction along with barometer pressure reading of the outside ambient. iv. Pitot static tube alone aligned with the flow direction. Considering the above statements, which of the following options is correct?"
