        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the determinant of a polynomial expression involving matrix A and the identity matrix I. The most efficient way to solve this is by using the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.\n\n1.  **Find the characteristic polynomial of A**: For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda)$ is given by $p(\\lambda) = \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^2 - (a+d)\\lambda + (ad-bc)$.\n    Given $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The trace of A is $\\text{trace}(A) = a+d = 3+4 = 7$.\n    The determinant of A is $\\text{det}(A) = (3)(4) - (-3)(-3) = 12 - 9 = 3$.\n    So, the characteristic polynomial is $p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 3$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem**: This theorem states that every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. Therefore, if $p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 3$ is the characteristic polynomial of A, then $p(A) = A^2 - 7A + 3I = 0$, where $0$ is the zero matrix.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the given expression**: We need to find $\\text{det}(-A^2 + 7A - 3I)$.\n    We can factor out $-1$ from the expression: $-A^2 + 7A - 3I = -(A^2 - 7A + 3I)$.\n    From the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, we know that $A^2 - 7A + 3I = 0$.\n    Substituting this into the expression: $-(A^2 - 7A + 3I) = -(0) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the determinant**: The expression simplifies to the zero matrix. The determinant of a zero matrix is $0$.\n    Therefore, $\\text{det}(-A^2 + 7A - 3I) = \\text{det}(0) = 0$.\n\nThis matches option A."
