        "reasoning": "The static thrust ($F_s$) of an air-breathing engine is fundamentally linked to the energy conversion from fuel to propulsive work. The thermal efficiency ($\\eta_{th}$) of the engine quantifies this conversion.\n\n1.  **Heat Input Rate:** The rate at which chemical energy is supplied by the fuel is given by $\\dot{Q}_{in} = \\dot{m}_f H_c$, where $\\dot{m}_f$ is the fuel mass flow rate and $H_c$ is the heat of combustion (calorific value) of the fuel.\n2.  **Propulsive Power:** For static conditions (take-off, where flight velocity $V_a = 0$), the useful propulsive power imparted to the exhaust jet is approximately $\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_e V_e^2$, where $\\dot{m}_e$ is the exhaust mass flow rate and $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity.\n3.  **Static Thrust Definition:** Static thrust is also defined as $F_s = \\dot{m}_e V_e$ (neglecting pressure thrust and assuming fuel-air ratio $f \\ll 1$, so $\\dot{m}_e \\approx \\dot{m}_a$). From this, we can express $\\dot{m}_e = \\frac{F_s}{V_e}$.\n4.  **Relating Propulsive Power to Thrust:** Substitute $\\dot{m}_e$ into the propulsive power expression: Propulsive Power $= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{F_s}{V_e}\\right) V_e^2 = \\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e$.\n5.  **Thermal Efficiency Equation:** By definition, thermal efficiency is the ratio of propulsive power to heat input rate:\n    $\\eta_{th} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$\n6.  **Solving for Static Thrust:** Rearranging the equation to solve for $F_s$:\n    $F_s = \\frac{2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c}{V_e}$\n\nThe question states that the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) and thermal efficiency ($\\eta_{th}$) are 'given' (i.e., constant). Also, 'burning aviation turbine fuel' implies that the heat of combustion ($H_c$) is constant. Therefore, all terms in the numerator ($2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c$) are constant.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that $F_s \\propto \\frac{1}{V_e}$, meaning static thrust is inversely proportional to the exhaust velocity. This matches option B."

This is derived from the kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust and the thrust definition $F_s = \\dot{m}_e V_e$.",
          "Step 5: Formulate the thermal efficiency equation by dividing the propulsive power by the heat input rate: $\\eta_{th} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$.",

Mishra's video lecture) was highly relevant, directly providing the derived formula $F_s = (2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c) / V_e$ and explicitly stating the inverse proportionality between static thrust and exhaust velocity under constant fuel flow, thermal efficiency, and heat of combustion. This chunk was instrumental in validating the correct answer and providing the core reasoning."
