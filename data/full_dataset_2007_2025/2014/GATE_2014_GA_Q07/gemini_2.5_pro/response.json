        "reasoning": "The problem requires systematically applying the given clues to determine the floor assignments for each person. We can use a process of elimination and deduction.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Six people: Anuj (A), Bhola (B), Chandan (C), Dilip (D), Eswar (E), Faisal (F)\n*   Six floors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n**Clues:**\n1.  Anuj lives on an even-numbered floor. (A $\\in$ {2, 4, 6})\n2.  Bhola does not live on an odd-numbered floor. (B $\\in$ {2, 4, 6})\n3.  Chandan does not live on any of the floors below Faisal's floor. (C > F)\n4.  Dilip does not live on floor number 2. (D $\\neq$ 2)\n5.  Eswar does not live on a floor immediately above or immediately below Bhola. (E $\\neq$ B+1 and E $\\neq$ B-1)\n6.  Faisal lives three floors above Dilip. (F = D + 3)\n\n**Step-by-step Deduction:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 6 (F = D + 3)**\nThis is a very restrictive clue. Let's list possible (Dilip, Faisal) pairs:\n*   If D = 1, then F = 1 + 3 = 4. (D=1, F=4)\n*   If D = 2, then F = 2 + 3 = 5. However, Clue 4 states D $\\neq$ 2. So, this pair is invalid.\n*   If D = 3, then F = 3 + 3 = 6. (D=3, F=6)\n\nSo, we have two main cases to consider: (D=1, F=4) or (D=3, F=6).\n\n**Case 1: Dilip lives on Floor 1 (D=1) and Faisal lives on Floor 4 (F=4)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, F=4\n*   Remaining floors: {2, 3, 5, 6}\n*   Remaining people: A, B, C, E\n\nNow apply other clues to the remaining people and floors:\n*   Clue 1: A is even. A $\\in$ {2, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 2: B is even. B $\\in$ {2, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 3: C > F. Since F=4, C must be on a floor higher than 4. C $\\in$ {5, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 5: E $\\neq$ B+1 and E $\\neq$ B-1.\n\nLet's try assigning A and B to the even floors {2, 6}:\n\n**Subcase 1.1: Anuj on Floor 2 (A=2) and Bhola on Floor 6 (B=6)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, A=2, F=4, B=6\n*   Remaining floors: {3, 5}\n*   Remaining people: C, E\n\n*   From Clue 3 (C > F, i.e., C > 4): C must be on Floor 5.\n*   This leaves E for Floor 3.\n\nSo, the arrangement is: D=1, A=2, E=3, F=4, C=5, B=6.\nLet's verify all clues for this arrangement:\n1.  A is even (A=2) - **Satisfied**\n2.  B is even (B=6) - **Satisfied**\n3.  C > F (C=5, F=4) - **Satisfied**\n4.  D $\\neq$ 2 (D=1) - **Satisfied**\n5.  E $\\neq$ B+1 and E $\\neq$ B-1 (E=3, B=6. E $\\neq$ 7 and E $\\neq$ 5) - **Satisfied**\n6.  F = D+3 (F=4, D=1) - **Satisfied**\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all conditions. Let's list it by person:\nAnuj: 2, Bhola: 6, Chandan: 5, Dilip: 1, Eswar: 3, Faisal: 4.\nThis matches **Option B**.\n\n**Subcase 1.2: Anuj on Floor 6 (A=6) and Bhola on Floor 2 (B=2)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, B=2, F=4, A=6\n*   Remaining floors: {3, 5}\n*   Remaining people: C, E\n\n*   From Clue 3 (C > F, i.e., C > 4): C must be on Floor 5.\n*   This leaves E for Floor 3.\n\nSo, the arrangement is: D=1, B=2, E=3, F=4, C=5, A=6.\nLet's verify Clue 5:\n5.  E $\\neq$ B+1 and E $\\neq$ B-1 (E=3, B=2. Here, B+1 = 2+1 = 3. So E is immediately above B). This **violates** Clue 5.\n\nTherefore, Subcase 1.2 is invalid.\n\n**Case 2: Dilip lives on Floor 3 (D=3) and Faisal lives on Floor 6 (F=6)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=3, F=6\n*   Remaining floors: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n*   Remaining people: A, B, C, E\n\n*   Clue 3: C > F. Since F=6, C must be on a floor higher than 6. This is impossible as 6 is the highest floor.\n\nTherefore, Case 2 is invalid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only valid arrangement is from Subcase 1.1, which corresponds to Option B."
