By carefully analyzing these constraints, we can deduce that the only combination that satisfies all the given conditions is:\nAnuj: 2, Bhola: 6, Chandan: 5, Dilip: 1, Eswar: 3, Faisal: 4.\nThis is because:\n1. Anuj lives on an even-numbered floor, which can only be 2 or 4. Since Chandan does not live on any floor below Faisal's floor, and Faisal lives 3 floors above Dilip (who lives on floor 1), Faisal must be on floor 4. Therefore, Anuj must be on floor 2.\n2. Bhola does not live on an odd-numbered floor, so he must be on floor 2 or 6. Since Anuj is on floor 2, Bhola must be on floor 6.\n3. Chandan does not live on any floor below Faisal's floor 4, so he must be on floor 5 or 6. Since Bhola is on floor 6, Chandan must be on floor 5.\n4. Dilip does not live on floor 2, so he must be on floor 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since Faisal is 3 floors above Dilip, Dilip must be on floor 1.\n5. Eswar does not live on a floor immediately above or below Bhola, who is on floor 6. So Eswar must be on floor 3.\nTherefore, the only combination that satisfies all the given conditions is option B."
