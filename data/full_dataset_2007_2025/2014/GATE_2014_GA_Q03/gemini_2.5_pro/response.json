        "reasoning": "The core of the problem lies in understanding the implication of Rajan's 'unhappiness'. If Rajan was unhappy that Sajan decided to do the project on his own, it logically follows that Rajan had a prior expectation or belief that they would be working together. Rajan's unhappiness is a direct emotional response to the unmet expectation of collaboration. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 'Rajan has decided to work only in a group.' This is an overgeneralization. The text only states Rajan's unhappiness regarding Sajan's specific decision, not a general policy about his work preferences.\nB. 'Rajan and Sajan were formed into a group against their wishes.' The text does not mention them being 'formed into a group' by an external entity. Sajan's decision to work 'on his own' implies his choice, and his explanation of preferring to work independently further contradicts the idea that he was forced into a group against his wishes. Rajan's unhappiness is about Sajan's independent choice, not about being forced into a group.\nC. 'Sajan had decided to give in to Rajan’s request to work with him.' This is directly contradicted by the second sentence, where Sajan 'explained to Rajan that he preferred to work independently.' This clearly indicates Sajan did *not* give in to work with Rajan.\nD. 'Rajan had believed that Sajan and he would be working together.' This is the most logical inference. Rajan's unhappiness at Sajan's independent work strongly suggests that Rajan had an expectation or belief that they would collaborate. If he had no such belief, Sajan's decision to work alone would not necessarily cause him unhappiness in this context."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Carefully read and understand the first sentence: \"Rajan was not happy that Sajan decided to do the project on his own.\" This establishes Rajan's emotional state (unhappiness) and the cause (Sajan's independent decision).",
          "Step 2: Carefully read and understand the second sentence: \"On observing his unhappiness, Sajan explained to Rajan that he preferred to work independently.\" This confirms Sajan's preference and reinforces that his independent work is the reason for Rajan's unhappiness.",
          "Step 3: Analyze what Rajan's unhappiness implies. For someone to be unhappy about another person's decision to work alone, it suggests that the unhappy person (Rajan) had a different expectation – specifically, an expectation of working together.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option A: \"Rajan has decided to work only in a group.\" This is too broad an inference. The text only speaks to Rajan's reaction to Sajan's specific decision, not a general rule for Rajan's work style.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option B: \"Rajan and Sajan were formed into a group against their wishes.\" This is not supported. The text implies Sajan made a choice to work alone, and there's no mention of an external force forming a group.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option C: \"Sajan had decided to give in to Rajan’s request to work with him.\" This is directly contradicted by Sajan's statement that he 'preferred to work independently.'",
          "Step 7: Evaluate Option D: \"Rajan had believed that Sajan and he would be working together.\" This aligns perfectly with the inference from Step 3. Rajan's unhappiness is a logical consequence of his belief in collaboration being unmet by Sajan's independent action."
