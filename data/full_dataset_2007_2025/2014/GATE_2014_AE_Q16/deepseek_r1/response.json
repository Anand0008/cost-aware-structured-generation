Low-speed transport aircraft (e.g., regional airlines) use turboprops for high efficiency at low speeds. High subsonic civilian aircraft (e.g., commercial airliners) use high-bypass turbofans for optimal fuel efficiency at Mach 0.8-0.85. Supersonic fighter aircraft use turbojets or low-bypass turbofans (with afterburners) for high thrust at supersonic speeds; turbojet is the best match among the options. Hypersonic aircraft require ramjets or scramjets, as they rely on ram compression at very high speeds; ramjet is the appropriate choice given the options. This logic is confirmed by the RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) which describes the efficiency vs. speed trade-offs."

          "Step 6: For 'Supersonic fighter aircraft' (e.g., MiG-21, early supersonic jets), turbojets (often with afterburners) provide high thrust at supersonic speeds. Ramjets are not suitable for takeoff and low-speed flight, requiring a booster (Chunk 4, 6).",
