Turboprop engines are most efficient at low speeds because they accelerate a large mass of air to a small velocity change via a propeller. This matches statement ii (Turboprop).\n\nb) High subsonic civilian aircraft: Modern airliners cruise around Mach 0.8–0.85. High-bypass turbofan engines are specifically optimized for this regime, offering low SFC and high propulsive efficiency. This matches statement iv (Turbofan).\n\nc) Supersonic fighter aircraft: Fighters require high thrust at transonic/supersonic speeds and often use (afterburning) turbojets or low-bypass turbofans. In a basic classification question like this, the canonical match is turbojet. This matches statement iii (Turbojet).\n\nd) Hypersonic aircraft: At hypersonic speeds, air‑breathing ramjets/scramjets are appropriate; among the given options, only ramjet is a high‑speed air‑breathing engine suitable for very high Mach numbers. This matches statement i (Ramjet).\n\nThus the correct mapping is a-ii, b-iv, c-iii, d-i, which corresponds to option D, in agreement with the official key."
