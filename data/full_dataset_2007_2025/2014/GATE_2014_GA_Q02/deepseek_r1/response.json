        "reasoning": "The sentence fragment 'One of his biggest ______ was his ability to forgive.' requires a word that describes a positive, admirable personal quality. 'Ability to forgive' is universally regarded as a positive moral trait. Among the options: A. 'vice' is a negative habit or flaw. B. 'virtues' are positive moral qualities. C. 'choices' are neutral decisions or options. D. 'strength' can be a positive attribute but is less specific and less idiomatic in this context; 'virtues' is the standard term for enumerating positive moral characteristics. Therefore, 'virtues' is the most appropriate and grammatically correct completion."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Analyze the sentence structure and context. The phrase 'one of his biggest' indicates we are selecting from a set of his notable attributes.",

          "Step 3: Evaluate the semantic meaning of each option in relation to 'ability to forgive.'",
          "Step 4: Option A (vice): A vice is a moral failing or bad habit (e.g., greed, dishonesty). Forgiveness is not a failing; it is a positive trait. This is incorrect.",
          "Step 5: Option B (virtues): A virtue is a quality considered morally good or desirable (e.g., honesty, courage, forgiveness). This is a direct and precise fit.",
          "Step 6: Option C (choices): A choice is an act of selecting between possibilities. While forgiveness can be a choice, the phrase 'one of his biggest choices' is semantically awkward and does not frame forgiveness as a inherent personal quality. It is less appropriate.",
          "Step 7: Option D (strength): A strength can be a valuable asset or skill. Forgiveness can be considered a strength of character. However, 'virtues' is more specific to the moral dimension and is a more natural collocation with 'biggest' in this context. 'Strength' is not incorrect but is less ideal than 'virtues'.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that 'virtues' is the most apt word that aligns perfectly with the positive moral connotation of 'ability to forgive'."
