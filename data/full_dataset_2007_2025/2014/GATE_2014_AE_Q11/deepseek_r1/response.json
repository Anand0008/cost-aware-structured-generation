        "notes": "RAG chunks provided relevant background on generalized Hooke's law and calculation of Young's modulus from tensile tests (Chunks 3,4,6). Chunks 1,2,5 were about composite materials (strain compatibility) and were less directly relevant as the question is for a homogeneous isotropic bar. The core formulas needed were present in the video notes, so RAG was moderately helpful."

A bar of length 20cm and square cross-section (10mm x 10mm) of this material is subjected to a tensile load of 40kN. Under this load, length increases to 20.1cm while the cross-section reduces to 9.98mm x 9.98mm. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the material are:"
