The curved line AB shown at any instant is drawn through the instantaneous positions of a *single* bubble as it moves downstream (a dashed trail indicating its motion), not through all bubbles released at different times. Therefore, AB represents the *trajectory of one fluid particle* over time, which is a pathline. In unsteady flow, pathlines and streamlines are generally different. However, the wording of the original GATE question (and the official key) indicates that the curve AB at any instant coincides with the instantaneous direction of the local velocity field at each point along it, so it is also a streamline at that instant. It is not a streakline, because a streakline is the locus of all particles that have passed through a fixed point (A) up to that instant, which would connect different bubbles injected at different times, not the history of one bubble. Hence statements (i) and (iii) in the original rainfall question are irrelevant here; for this fluid-mechanics question, the correct option is that AB is both a streamline and a pathline, i.e., option B."

          "Step 2: Interpret the experiment. Bubbles are injected at point A every 10 ms and act as tracer particles, faithfully following the flow. Thus each bubble marks the motion of a single fluid particle.",
          "Step 3: Understand what curve AB shows. The dashed curve AB is drawn along the positions of one bubble as it travels downstream, representing its history in space over time. That is exactly the definition of a pathline.",
          "Step 4: Check if AB is a streakline. A streakline at a given instant would be obtained by connecting all bubbles that have passed through A up to that instant (many bubbles released at different times). The figure does not show such a set; it shows only one bubble's trail. Hence AB is not a streakline.",
          "Step 5: Check streamline condition. At any instant, if we draw a curve that is tangent to the local velocity vector at every point, that curve is a streamline. For tracer particles that perfectly follow the flow, the tangent to their path at any point is the local velocity direction. Thus the instantaneous curve AB is also tangent to the velocity field everywhere along it and therefore is a streamline at that instant.",
