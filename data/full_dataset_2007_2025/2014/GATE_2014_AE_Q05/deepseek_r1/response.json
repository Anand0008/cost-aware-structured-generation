But careful: with n=2, trapezoidal composite rule uses coefficients 1,2,1? Actually composite trapezoidal: (h/2)[f0+2f1+f2] = (0.5/2)[0+125+1000] = 0.25*1125=281.25? Wait, recalc: f1=62.5, 2f1=125, sum=1125, times 0.25=281.25. That's not an option. So maybe single trapezoid over [0,1]? That gives (1/2)(0+1000)=500. Not an option. Actually the common mistake is to use the basic trapezoidal rule on each interval? Let's compute correctly: For n=2, trapezoidal: (0.5/2)[f0+2f1+f2] = 0.25*(0+125+1000)=0.25*1125=281.25. Not an option. So perhaps they mistakenly use h=1 and apply trapezoidal: (1/2)(f0+f2)=500. Not an option either. But the exact integral is 200. So if they use trapezoidal with n=1 (single interval), they get 500, not an option. The mistake is more likely to confuse the formula. So the flashcard should be: The exact integral is 200, and Simpson's gives 208, trapezoidal gives different values. The key is to remember Simpson's formula. We'll adjust: The common mistake is to use the exact value 200 (option A) by either computing exactly or using wrong method.",
