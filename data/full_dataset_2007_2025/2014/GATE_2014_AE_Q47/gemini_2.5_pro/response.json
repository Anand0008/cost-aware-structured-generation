This allows for the determination of specific work input via the Euler turbomachinery equation. From the specific work, the actual stagnation temperature rise is found. Separately, the ideal (isentropic) stagnation temperature rise is calculated using the given pressure ratio. Finally, the overall total-to-total efficiency is computed as the ratio of isentropic temperature rise to actual temperature rise. All steps are standard for centrifugal compressor analysis, yielding an efficiency of approximately 74.89%, which falls within the specified range of 74% to 76%."

If the slip factor sigma_s (Ratio of tangential component of air velocity at the blade tip to the blade tip speed) is 0.88, the overall efficiency (total-to-total) of the compressor (in %) is ___________."
