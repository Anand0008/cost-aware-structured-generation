Air enters axially, so inlet whirl velocity V_{w1} = 0.",
          "Step 2: Calculate the impeller tip speed u_2. u_2 = (2\\pi N r_2)/60 = (2\\pi * 15000 * 0.3)/60 = 1500\\pi * 0.3 = 450\\pi ≈ 1413.72 m/s? Wait, this seems unrealistic. Let's recalculate: u_2 = \\omega * r_2, where \\omega = (2\\pi N)/60 = (2\\pi * 15000)/60 = 500\\pi rad/s ≈ 1570.8 rad/s. Then u_2 = 1570.8 * 0.3 = 471.24 m/s. (Correct calculation).",

          "Step 4: Calculate the actual specific work input (w_c_act) using the Euler turbomachinery equation for axial inlet (V_{w1}=0): w_c_act = u_2 * V_{w2} = 471.24 * 414.69 ≈ 195,430 J/kg.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the actual stagnation temperature rise using the specific heat at constant pressure. First, find C_p = (\\gamma R)/(\\gamma - 1) = (1.4 * 287)/0.4 = 1004.5 J/kgK. Then, w_c_act = C_p (T_03 - T_01). Thus, T_03 - T_01 = 195430 / 1004.5 ≈ 194.53 K. So T_03 = 300 + 194.53 = 494.53 K.",

However, none of the chunks explicitly showed the exact step-by-step calculation for total-to-total efficiency given slip factor and pressure ratio. The calculation had to be synthesized from separate pieces: slip factor definition (Chunk 3), Euler work (implied in Chunks 2,4,6), and isentropic relations (Chunk 4). Chunk 1 had lower relevance (general centrifugal compressor facts). Overall, RAG was helpful but not perfectly tailored."
