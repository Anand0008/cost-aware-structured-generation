The key is to correctly apply the thin-walled approximation for the hollow shaft. \n\n1.  **Maximum Shear Stress for Design I (Solid Shaft):**\n    `$\\tau_{max,1} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d_1^3}$`\n    Given `d_1 = 30 mm`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Shear Stress for Design II (Thin-Walled Hollow Shaft):**\n    For a thin-walled circular shaft with average diameter `d_{avg}` and thickness `t`, the maximum shear stress is approximately:\n    `$\\tau_{max,2} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi d_{avg}^2 t}$`\n    Given `d_{avg} = 40 mm`.\n\n3.  **Equate Maximum Shear Stresses:**\n    Since `$\\tau_{max,1} = \\tau_{max,2}$`:\n    `$\\frac{16T}{\\pi d_1^3} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi d_{avg}^2 t}$`\n    `$\\frac{16}{d_1^3} = \\frac{2}{d_{avg}^2 t}$`\n    Solving for `t`:\n    `$t = \\frac{2 d_1^3}{16 d_{avg}^2} = \\frac{d_1^3}{8 d_{avg}^2}$`\n    Substitute values:\n    `$t = \\frac{(30 mm)^3}{8 \\times (40 mm)^2} = \\frac{27000}{8 \\times 1600} = \\frac{27000}{12800} = 2.109375 mm$`\n\n4.  **Calculate Cross-sectional Areas:**\n    *   Area of Design I (Solid): `A_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_1^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (30)^2 = 225\\pi mm^2`\n    *   Area of Design II (Thin-Walled Hollow): `A_2 \\approx \\pi d_{avg} t`\n        `$A_2 = \\pi (40 mm) (2.109375 mm) = 84.375\\pi mm^2$`\n\n5.  **Ratio of Masses:**\n    Since both shafts have the same length `l` and are made of the same material (same density `$\\rho$`), the ratio of their masses is equal to the ratio of their cross-sectional areas:\n    `$\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{\\rho A_1 L}{\\rho A_2 L} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$`\n    `$\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{225\\pi}{84.375\\pi} = \\frac{225}{84.375} \\approx 2.6666...$`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is `2.67` or `2.68`.

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters for both shaft designs. Design I is a solid shaft with diameter `d_1 = 30 mm`. Design II is a thin-walled hollow shaft with average diameter `d_{avg} = 40 mm`. Both shafts carry the same torque `T`, have the same length `l`, are made of the same material (same density `$\\rho$`), and experience the same maximum shear stress `$\\tau_{max}$`.",
          "Step 2: Write down the formula for the maximum shear stress in a solid circular shaft (Design I). This is given by `$\\tau_{max,1} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d_1^3}$`.",
          "Step 3: Write down the approximate formula for the maximum shear stress in a thin-walled circular hollow shaft (Design II). For a thin-walled circular shaft, the shear stress is approximately uniform across the thickness and can be expressed as `$\\tau_{max,2} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi d_{avg}^2 t}$`, where `t` is the wall thickness.",
          "Step 4: Equate the maximum shear stresses from both designs, `$\\tau_{max,1} = \\tau_{max,2}$`, and solve for the wall thickness `t` of the hollow shaft. This yields `$\\frac{16T}{\\pi d_1^3} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi d_{avg}^2 t}$`, which simplifies to `t = \\frac{d_1^3}{8 d_{avg}^2}`. Substitute the given diameters to find `t`.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the cross-sectional area for Design I (solid shaft). The area is `A_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_1^2`.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the cross-sectional area for Design II (thin-walled hollow shaft). For a thin-walled circular shaft, the area can be approximated as `A_2 = \\pi d_{avg} t`.",
          "Step 7: Determine the ratio of the mass of Design I to the mass of Design II. Since mass `m = \\rho A L`, and `$\\rho$` and `L` are the same for both, the ratio of masses is simply the ratio of their cross-sectional areas: `$\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$`. Perform the final calculation."
