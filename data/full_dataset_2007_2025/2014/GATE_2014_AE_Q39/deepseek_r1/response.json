Design II is a thin-walled circular shaft of average diameter 40mm. Thickness of the wall in Design II has to be determined such that maximum shear stress is the same in both the designs for the given torque T (so that same material can be used for manufacturing both the shafts). Ratio of mass of shaft using Design I to the mass of shaft using Design II is"
