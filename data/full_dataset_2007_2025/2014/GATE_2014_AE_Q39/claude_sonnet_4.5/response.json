The calculation steps are as follows:\n\nFor Design I (solid shaft):\nCross-sectional Area = $\\pi \\times (30 \\text{mm})^2 / 4 = 707.1 \\text{mm}^2$\n\nFor Design II (hollow shaft):\nCross-sectional Area = $\\pi \\times ((40 \\text{mm})^2 - (30 \\text{mm})^2) / 4 = 264.5 \\text{mm}^2$\n\nRatio of Areas = $707.1 \\text{mm}^2 / 264.5 \\text{mm}^2 = 2.68$\n\nSince the ratio of masses is directly proportional to the ratio of cross-sectional areas, the ratio of masses of the two shaft designs is 2.68.
