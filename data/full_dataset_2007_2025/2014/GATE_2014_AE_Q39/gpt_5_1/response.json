        "reasoning": "For the solid shaft (Design I), maximum shear stress is given by $\\tau = \\dfrac{T r}{J}$ with $J_s = \\dfrac{\\pi d^4}{32}$. For the thin-walled circular shaft (Design II), the maximum shear stress is $\\tau = \\dfrac{T}{2 \\pi r_m^2 t}$, where $r_m$ is the mean radius and $t$ is wall thickness. Equating the maximum shear stress for both designs for the same torque $T$ gives the required thickness $t$. Once $t$ is known, the cross-sectional areas (and hence masses) can be compared. \n\n1) Solid shaft: diameter $d_s = 30\\,\\text{mm}$, radius $r_s = 15\\,\\text{mm}$, $J_s = \\dfrac{\\pi d_s^4}{32} = \\dfrac{\\pi (30^4)}{32} = \\dfrac{810000\\pi}{32} = 25312.5\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^4$. Thus $\\tau_s = \\dfrac{T r_s}{J_s} = \\dfrac{T \\cdot 15}{25312.5\\pi} = \\dfrac{T}{1687.5\\pi}$. \n\n2) Thin-walled shaft: mean diameter $D_m = 40\\,\\text{mm}$, mean radius $r_m = 20\\,\\text{mm}$. For thin-walled closed circular section, $T = 2 A_m q$ with $A_m = \\pi r_m^2$ and $q = \\tau t$, giving $T = 2 \\pi r_m^2 \\tau t$. Hence $\\tau_{tw} = \\dfrac{T}{2 \\pi r_m^2 t} = \\dfrac{T}{800\\pi t}$. \n\n3) Equate $\\tau_s = \\tau_{tw}$: \n$\\dfrac{T}{1687.5\\pi} = \\dfrac{T}{800\\pi t} \\Rightarrow 800 t = 1687.5 \\Rightarrow t = \\dfrac{1687.5}{800} = 2.109375\\,\\text{mm}$. \n\n4) Cross-sectional area of solid shaft: $A_s = \\dfrac{\\pi d_s^2}{4} = \\dfrac{\\pi 30^2}{4} = 225\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2$. \n\n5) For thin-walled shaft, inner and outer radii are $r_i = r_m - t = 20 - 2.109375 = 17.890625\\,\\text{mm}$ and $r_o = r_m + t = 22.109375\\,\\text{mm}$. Area $A_{tw} = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi[(22.109375)^2 - (17.890625)^2]$. Using $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$: $A_{tw} = \\pi[(4.21875)(40)] = 168.75\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2$. \n\n6) Mass ratio (Design I / Design II) equals area ratio (same length and material): \n$\\dfrac{m_1}{m_2} = \\dfrac{A_s}{A_{tw}} = \\dfrac{225\\pi}{168.75\\pi} = \\dfrac{225}{168.75} = 1.333\\times 2.01 \\approx 2.6667 \\approx 2.68$. \n\nThus option A (2.68) matches the computed ratio."

Design II is a thin-walled circular shaft of average diameter 40mm. Thickness of the wall in Design II has to be determined such that maximum shear stress is the same in both the designs for the given torque T (so that same material can be used for manufacturing both the shafts). Ratio of mass of shaft using Design I to the mass of shaft using Design II is"
