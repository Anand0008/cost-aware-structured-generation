        "reasoning": "In classical mechanics, mass is a fundamental property of a body and is conserved. Applying external loads (forces) to a solid object causes deformation (change in shape and/or volume), but it does not add or remove matter from the object. Therefore, the mass of the solid remains constant under arbitrary loading, assuming non-relativistic conditions and no material loss (e.g., ablation, chemical reaction).\n\n*   **Option A (Volume does not vary with loading):** This is generally false. Solids are deformable bodies (as highlighted in RAG Chunks 1 and 4). Under tensile loads, a solid typically elongates and its volume increases. Under compressive loads, its volume decreases. Thus, volume *does* vary with loading.\n*   **Option C (Density does not vary with loading):** This is also false. Density ($\\\\rho$) is defined as mass ($m$) per unit volume ($V$), i.e., $\\\\rho = m/V$ (RAG Chunk 5). Since mass ($m$) remains constant (as established for Option B) and volume ($V$) generally changes with loading (as established for Option A), density ($\\\\rho$) must also change. For instance, if volume decreases under compression, density increases.\n*   **Option D (Volume, mass and density vary with loading):** This statement is partially true (volume and density vary) but incorrect because mass does not vary with loading."

When subjected to external loads (tensile, compressive, shear, torsional), they undergo deformation. This deformation typically involves a change in the overall dimensions and thus the volume of the body. For example, a material under tension will generally experience an increase in volume, while under compression, its volume will decrease. Hence, volume *does* vary with loading.",
