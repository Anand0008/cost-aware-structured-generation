From Anderson and the RAG chunks, for high-n maneuvering flight the turn radius can be written in terms of wing loading and lift coefficient as:\n\n1) General pull-up relation:  \\(R = \\frac{V^2}{g(n-1)}\\). For a given speed V, increasing load factor n decreases R and increases turn rate \\(\\omega = \\frac{g(n-1)}{V}\\).\n\n2) Using lift: \\(n = \\frac{L}{W} = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L}{W}\\). For a given airplane (fixed W/S) and flight condition (\\(\\rho\\)), the maximum n is achieved at maximum lift coefficient \\(C_{L\\max}\\).\n\n3) Eliminating V between the lift equation and the turn-radius expression gives (RAG chunk 5 and Anderson):\n\\[ R = \\frac{2}{\\rho g C_L} \\left(\\frac{W}{S}\\right). \\]\nFor a given airplane and altitude, \\(\\rho\\) and \\(W/S\\) are fixed, so \\(R \\propto 1/C_L\\). Thus, minimum radius requires the highest possible \\(C_L\\), i.e., \\(C_{L\\max}\\).\n\n4) At the same time, the tightest turn (minimum R and maximum \\(\\omega\\)) on the V–n diagram occurs at the maneuver point (corner velocity), where both \\(C_L = C_{L\\max}\\) and \\(n = n_{\\max}\\). So we need the highest possible load factor as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct qualitative condition is: highest possible \\(C_L\\) and highest possible load factor, which matches option D."
