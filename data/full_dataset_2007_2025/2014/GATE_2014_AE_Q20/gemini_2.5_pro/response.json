        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5) consistently states that for an ideal turbojet engine with a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (TET), increasing the compressor pressure ratio ($\\pi_c$) initially increases specific thrust (and thus thrust) due to improved thermal efficiency and greater expansion potential. However, beyond an optimum pressure ratio, the specific thrust starts to decrease. This is because a larger portion of the available energy from the fixed TET is consumed by the increasing compressor work, leaving less energy for conversion into kinetic energy in the nozzle. Therefore, the thrust first increases and then decreases with increasing compressor pressure ratio."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the basic operation of a turbojet engine and the role of the compressor pressure ratio ($\\pi_c = P_{02}/P_{01}$). A higher $\\pi_c$ means the air is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustor.",
          "Step 2: Consider the effect of increasing $\\pi_c$ on the compressor discharge temperature ($T_{02}$). According to isentropic compression, $T_{02} = T_{01} (\\pi_c)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$. Thus, as $\\pi_c$ increases, $T_{02}$ increases.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the impact on heat addition and thermal efficiency. With a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature ($T_{03}$), an increasing $T_{02}$ means the temperature rise across the combustor ($T_{03} - T_{02}$) decreases. This implies less heat addition per unit mass flow rate, leading to lower fuel consumption and generally higher thermal efficiency.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the effect on compressor and turbine work. Compressor work ($W_c = c_p (T_{02} - T_{01})$) increases with increasing $\\pi_c$. The turbine must produce this work ($W_t = W_c$).",
          "Step 5: Relate these changes to thrust generation. Initially, as $\\pi_c$ increases, the overall pressure ratio of the cycle increases, leading to higher thermal efficiency and greater expansion potential in the nozzle. This results in a higher exhaust velocity ($V_e$) and thus increased thrust ($F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_a) + (P_e - P_a)A_e$).",
          "Step 6: Identify the point of diminishing returns. Beyond an optimum $\\pi_c$, the compressor work becomes so large that it consumes a significant fraction of the energy available from the fixed $T_{03}$. Although the thermal efficiency might still be improving, the energy remaining for conversion into kinetic energy in the nozzle (to produce thrust) starts to decrease. This leads to a reduction in exhaust velocity and consequently, a decrease in net thrust.",
          "Step 7: Conclude the overall trend. The specific thrust (and total thrust) of a turbojet engine, for a fixed TET, first increases with increasing compressor pressure ratio, reaches an optimum, and then decreases."
