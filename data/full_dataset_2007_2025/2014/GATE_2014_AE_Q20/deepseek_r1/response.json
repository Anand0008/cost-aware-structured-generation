        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5) explicitly describes the non-monotonic relationship between specific thrust and compressor pressure ratio for an ideal turbojet with fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (TET). The thrust (specifically specific thrust) initially increases due to improved thermal efficiency and higher pressure thrust potential, reaches a maximum at an optimum pressure ratio, and then decreases because an increasing fraction of the available energy is used to drive the compressor, leaving less energy for jet kinetic energy. This matches option D: 'First increases and then decreases'."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the system and constraints. The system is an ideal turbojet engine. The constraint is a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (TET or T03). The variable is compressor pressure ratio (P02/P01 or $\\pi_c$).",
          "Step 2: Recall the governing principle. For an ideal turbojet, thrust $F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0) + (p_e - p_a)A_e$. The exit velocity $V_e$ and pressure $p_e$ depend on the thermodynamic state of the gas exiting the nozzle, which is set by the compressor and turbine work balance.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of increasing $\\pi_c$. As $\\pi_c$ increases, compressor discharge temperature $T02$ increases ($T_{02} = T_{01} \\pi_c^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$). Since TET (T03) is fixed, the combustor temperature rise (T03-T02) decreases, reducing the required heat addition (fuel flow).",
          "Step 4: Understand the work balance. Compressor work $W_c = c_p (T_{02} - T_{01})$ increases. Turbine work $W_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04})$ must equal $W_c$, so $T_{04}$ must decrease.",
          "Step 5: Determine the net effect on thrust. A lower $T_{04}$ means less thermal energy available for conversion to kinetic energy in the nozzle. However, a higher overall cycle pressure ratio increases the expansion potential. Initially, the benefit of higher pressure ratio dominates, increasing thrust. Beyond an optimum point, the reduction in exhaust energy (lower $T_{04}$) dominates, causing thrust to decrease.",
          "Step 6: Conclude. The thrust does not increase or decrease monotonically; it peaks at an optimum compressor pressure ratio."
