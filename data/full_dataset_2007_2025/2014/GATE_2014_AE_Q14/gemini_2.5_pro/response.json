The undamped natural frequency ($\\omega_n$) is given in Hz, and the two frequencies ($\\omega_1$, $\\omega_2$) at which the power is half of the maximum are given in rad/s. The steps to solve this are as follows:\n\n1.  **Convert Undamped Natural Frequency:** The given undamped natural frequency is $f_n = 10 \\text{ Hz}$. To use it consistently with other frequencies given in rad/s, convert it to angular frequency $\\omega_n$:\n    $\\omega_n = 2\\pi f_n = 2\\pi \\times 10 = 20\\pi \\text{ rad/s} \\approx 62.83185 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n\n2.  **Identify Half-Power Frequencies:** The two frequencies where power is half of the maximum are given as:\n    $\\omega_1 = 60.9469 \\text{ rad/s}$\n    $\\omega_2 = 64.7168 \\text{ rad/s}$\n\n3.  **Apply Half-Power Bandwidth Formula:** For a lightly damped SDOF system, the damping ratio ($\\zeta$) can be determined using the half-power bandwidth method, which states:\n    $\\zeta = \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{2\\omega_n}$\n\n4.  **Substitute and Calculate:** Substitute the values into the formula:\n    $\\zeta = \\frac{64.7168 - 60.9469}{2 \\times (20\\pi)}$\n    $\\zeta = \\frac{3.7699}{40\\pi}$\n    $\\zeta \\approx \\frac{3.7699}{125.6637} \\approx 0.029999$\n\n5.  **Convert to Percentage:** The question asks for the damping factor in percentage:\n    Damping factor $= \\zeta \\times 100\\% = 0.029999 \\times 100\\% \\approx 3.0\\%$\n\nThis calculated value of 3.0% falls within the specified answer key range of 2.95 to 3.05."
