        "reasoning": "The problem involves a simply supported beam with overhangs subjected to a concentrated load at the center of the main span. The magnitude of the slope at the tip of the overhang (S) is required.\n\n1.  **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):** For a rectangular cross-section with width $b = 10 \\text{ mm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}$ and height $h = 6 \\text{ mm} = 0.006 \\text{ m}$, the moment of inertia is $I = \\frac{bh^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.01 \\text{ m})(0.006 \\text{ m})^3}{12} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Flexural Rigidity (EI):** Given Young's Modulus $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, the flexural rigidity is $EI = (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2)(1.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4) = 36 \\text{ N m}^2$.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactions:** The beam has supports at Q and R, with a span $L_{span} = 1.2 \\text{ m}$. A 50 N load is applied at the center O of this span. Due to symmetry, the reactions at Q and R are $R_Q = R_R = \\frac{50 \\text{ N}}{2} = 25 \\text{ N}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze Overhang R-S:** The segment R-S is an overhang of length $0.3 \\text{ m}$. There are no external loads acting on this segment.\n    *   Since there are no external loads, the shear force ($V$) in the segment R-S is zero.\n    *   As $V = \\frac{dM}{dx}$, a zero shear force implies a constant bending moment ($M$) in the segment R-S.\n    *   At the free end S, the bending moment $M_S = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the bending moment $M(x)$ is zero throughout the entire segment R-S.\n    *   If $M(x) = 0$, then the curvature $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{M}{EI} = 0$.\n    *   Integrating this twice shows that the deflection curve for R-S is a straight line ($y = C_1 x + C_2$). This means the slope is constant throughout the overhang R-S.\n    *   Thus, the slope at tip S ($\\theta_S$) is equal to the slope at support R ($\\theta_R$).\n\n5.  **Calculate Slope at Support R ($\\theta_R$):** For a simply supported beam of length $L_{span}$ with a central concentrated load $P$, the magnitude of the slope at the supports is given by the formula: $\\theta_R = \\frac{P L_{span}^2}{16 E I}$.\n    $\\theta_R = \\frac{50 \\text{ N} \\times (1.2 \\text{ m})^2}{16 \\times 36 \\text{ N m}^2} = \\frac{50 \\times 1.44}{576} = \\frac{72}{576} = 0.125 \\text{ radians}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The magnitude of the slope at tip S is $0.125 \\text{ radians}$. This value falls within the provided answer key range of 0.12 to 0.13."
