The slope at the support for a simply supported beam with a central concentrated load is given by $\\theta = \\frac{PL^2}{16EI}$. Since the overhangs are unloaded, the slope is constant along them, so the slope at tip S equals the slope at the adjacent support. Using L=1.2 m, P=50 N, E=200 GPa, and I calculated from the cross-section (10 mm x 6 mm, with the 6 mm dimension as depth for bending about the neutral axis), we get I = (10e-3)*(6e-3)^3/12 = 1.8e-10 m^4. Plugging in yields $\\theta = \\frac{50 * (1.2)^2}{16 * 200 \\times 10^9 * 1.8 \\times 10^{-10}} = 0.125$ rad, which matches the answer key range (0.12 to 0.13)."

    "question_text": "A 1.8m long steel beam of rectangular cross section (10mm x 6mm) is simply supported with a length of 1.2m between the supports and an overhang of 0.3m on either side. Young's modulus for the material of the beam is 200GPa. For a 50N load applied at the center of the beam, magnitude of the slope of the beam at tip S is _______."
