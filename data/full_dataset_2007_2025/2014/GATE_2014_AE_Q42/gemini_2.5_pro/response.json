          "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides exact analytical solutions for certain problems. Cons: Requires a 'smart guess' for the initial form, which can be challenging for complex problems. Can be mathematically intensive.",
          "when_to_use": "When an exact analytical solution is desired for a 2D elasticity problem, and a reasonable form for the stress function can be hypothesized or is suggested by the problem's nature (e.g., beam bending)."
