        "reasoning": "For an Airy stress function \\(\\phi(x,y) = C_1 x y + C_2 x y^3 + C_3 x^2 y^2 + C_4 x^3 y\\), the plane-stress components are \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial y^2\\), \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial x^2\\), and \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2 \\phi / (\\partial x \\partial y)\\). 1) Compute stresses: \\n\\(\\sigma_x = 2 C_2 x y + 2 C_3 x^2 + 6 C_4 x^3\\); \\n\\(\\sigma_y = 2 C_3 y^2 + 6 C_4 x y\\); \\n\\(\\tau_{xy} = -C_1 - 3 C_2 y^2 - 2 C_3 x y - 3 C_4 x^2\\). 2) Top and bottom surfaces (\\(y = \\pm d\\)) are traction-free, so both \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\) there for all \\(x\\). From \\(\\sigma_y = 2 C_3 d^2 + 6 C_4 x (\\pm d)\\) to vanish for all \\(x\\) and both signs of \\(y\\), we must have \\(C_3 = 0\\) and \\(C_4 = 0\\). Then \\(\\sigma_y \\equiv 0\\). With \\(C_3 = C_4 = 0\\), \\(\\tau_{xy} = -C_1 - 3 C_2 y^2\\). Traction-free top and bottom require \\(\\tau_{xy}(y = \\pm d) = 0\\), giving \\(-C_1 - 3 C_2 d^2 = 0\\) or \\(C_1 = -3 C_2 d^2\\). 3) At the right edge (say \\(x = L\\)), the only non-zero traction is shear, with given parabolic distribution \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\lambda [1 - (y/d)^2]\\). Our expression is independent of \\(x\\), so it must match this for all \\(y\\): \\(-C_1 - 3 C_2 y^2 = -\\lambda + (\\lambda/d^2) y^2\\). Equating coefficients of \\(y^0\\) and \\(y^2\\) gives \\(-C_1 = -\\lambda \\Rightarrow C_1 = \\lambda\\) and \\(-3 C_2 = \\lambda/d^2 \\Rightarrow C_2 = -\\lambda/(3 d^2)\\). This also satisfies \\(C_1 = -3 C_2 d^2\\). Thus the admissible constants are \\(C_1 = \\lambda, C_2 = -\\lambda/(3 d^2), C_3 = 0, C_4 = 0\\), which corresponds to option D. The proposed polynomial Airy function is biharmonic by construction (all terms are of degree 2 or 4 in x,y), so with these constants it satisfies both the biharmonic equation and all boundary conditions."

To solve this problem, following Airy's stress function is proposed: phi = C_1 x y + C_2 x y^3 + C_3 x^2 y^2 + C_4 x^3 y. This is an admissible Airy's function that would satisfy the bi-harmonic equation as well as the boundary conditions if and only if"
