(2) Boundary conditions: top/bottom surfaces (y = ±d) traction-free i.e., $\\sigma_y = 0$ and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$. Computing stresses from $\\phi$: $\\sigma_x = \\partial^2\\phi/\\partial y^2 = 6C_2 x y + 2C_3 x^2$, $\\sigma_y = \\partial^2\\phi/\\partial x^2 = 2C_3 y^2 + 6C_4 x y$, $\\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2\\phi/\\partial x\\partial y = -[C_1 + 3C_2 y^2 + 4C_3 x y + 3C_4 x^2]$. Setting $\\sigma_y=0$ at y=±d for all x gives $C_4=0$. Setting $\\tau_{xy}=0$ at y=±d gives $C_1 + 3C_2 d^2 = 0$. At the right edge (x=L), only a parabolic shear traction is specified; we don't impose $\\sigma_x=0$. The parabolic shear traction is satisfied by $\\tau_{xy}(L,y) = -[C_1 + 3C_2 y^2]$. For a parabolic distribution, we need $C_1$ and $C_2$ non-zero. Option D satisfies $C_3=0$, $C_4=0$, and $C_1 + 3C_2 d^2 = 0$ with $C_1=\\lambda$, $C_2=-\\lambda/(3d^2)$, producing $\\tau_{xy} = \\lambda(y^2/d^2 - 1)$, which is parabolic.

    "question_text": "A cantilevered beam is subjected to a parabolic distribution of shear traction at the right edge while the top and bottom surfaces are traction free. To solve this problem, following Airy's stress function is proposed: phi = C_1 x y + C_2 x y^3 + C_3 x^2 y^2 + C_4 x^3 y. This is an admissible Airy's function that would satisfy the bi-harmonic equation as well as the boundary conditions if and only if"
