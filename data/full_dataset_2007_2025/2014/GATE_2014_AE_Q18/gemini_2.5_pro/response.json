        "reasoning": "Statement I: For a 50% reaction axial compressor stage, it is a defining characteristic that the velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet are symmetrical. This means that the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet ($c_1$) is equal to the relative velocity at the rotor outlet ($w_2$), and the relative velocity at the rotor inlet ($w_1$) is equal to the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet ($c_2$). Similarly, the flow angles are symmetrical (e.g., $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$ and $\\beta_1 = \\alpha_2$). This is explicitly mentioned in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 4 and Chunk 6) as a common characteristic of 50% reaction stages, where the enthalpy drop is equally split between the stator and rotor. Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\nStatement II: The whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the entry of the rotor is $c_{t1}$ (or $V_{w1}$) and at the entry of the stator (which is the exit of the rotor) is $c_{t2}$ (or $V_{w2}$). For an axial flow compressor, work is done on the fluid by the rotor. According to the Euler turbomachinery equation, the specific work input ($W$) is given by $W = u(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$, where $u$ is the blade peripheral velocity. Since work is done on the fluid ($W > 0$) and $u$ is positive, it must be that $c_{t2} > c_{t1}$. This means the whirl component of absolute velocity increases across the rotor. Therefore, $c_{t1}$ and $c_{t2}$ cannot be the same. Thus, Statement II is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement I is correct, and Statement II is incorrect, which corresponds to option B."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of a 50% reaction axial compressor stage. A 50% reaction stage implies that half of the static enthalpy rise occurs in the rotor and the other half in the stator. This is a common design choice for achieving high efficiency.",
          "Step 2: Evaluate Statement I regarding the symmetry of velocity triangles. For a 50% reaction stage, the velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet are indeed symmetrical. This means that the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet ($c_1$) equals the relative velocity at the rotor outlet ($w_2$), and the relative velocity at the rotor inlet ($w_1$) equals the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet ($c_2$). Consequently, the flow angles also exhibit symmetry (e.g., $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$ and $\\beta_1 = \\alpha_2$). This characteristic is a direct result of the equal static enthalpy rise in the rotor and stator, leading to specific relationships between velocities and angles. (Refer to RAG Chunks 4 and 6).",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Statement II regarding the whirl components. The 'entry of rotor' refers to the inlet of the rotor (station 1), where the whirl component is $c_{t1}$. The 'entry of stator' refers to the outlet of the rotor (station 2), where the whirl component is $c_{t2}$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the Euler turbomachinery equation for a compressor. The specific work done on the fluid by the rotor is given by $W = u(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$. For a compressor, work is always done on the fluid, so $W > 0$. Since the blade peripheral velocity $u$ is positive, it must be that the whirl component at the rotor outlet ($c_{t2}$) is greater than the whirl component at the rotor inlet ($c_{t1}$).",
          "Step 5: Conclude on Statement II. Since $c_{t2} > c_{t1}$, the whirl components at the entry of the rotor and entry of the stator (rotor exit) are not the same. Therefore, Statement II is incorrect.",
