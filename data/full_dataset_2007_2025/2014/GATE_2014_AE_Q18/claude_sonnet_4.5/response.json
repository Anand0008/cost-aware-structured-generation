The whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the entry of rotor and entry of stator are same.\n\nFor a 50% reaction stage:\n- The velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet are symmetrical, as the pressure rise is equally split between the stator and rotor. This makes statement I correct.\n- However, the whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the rotor inlet and stator inlet are not the same. The stator converts the high whirl velocity from the rotor exit into a purely axial flow at its exit.
