        "reasoning": "For a 50% reaction axial compressor stage, the static enthalpy (and pressure) rise is equally split between the rotor and stator. A key characteristic of this design is symmetric velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet, meaning the relative velocity vectors (w1 and w2) are mirror images about the axial direction, typically implying equal magnitudes and equal but opposite flow angles relative to the axial direction (β2 = -β1 if inlet is positive). This makes Statement I correct. Statement II is incorrect: the whirl (tangential) component of absolute velocity changes across the rotor because the rotor does work on the fluid, increasing its angular momentum. At rotor entry (c_θ1) and stator entry (c_θ2, which is the rotor exit), c_θ2 is greater than c_θ1 for a compressor (assuming no inlet swirl). They are not the same."

          "Step 2: Understand the implication of R=0.5 on velocity triangles. A common design condition for 50% reaction is symmetric velocity triangles across the rotor. This means the relative velocity at rotor inlet (w1) and outlet (w2) have equal magnitudes, and the flow angles satisfy β2 = -β1 (with constant axial velocity). The absolute velocities c1 and c2 are also symmetric about the axial direction.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement I: 'Velocity triangles at the entry and exit of the rotor are symmetrical.' This is a defining feature of a 50% reaction stage under the common design condition of constant axial velocity and equal blade speeds at inlet and outlet. Therefore, Statement I is correct.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement II: 'The whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the entry of rotor and entry of stator are same.' The entry of the stator is the exit of the rotor. The whirl component (c_θ) changes across the rotor due to work input (Euler's work equation: w = u*(c_θ2 - c_θ1)). For a compressor, c_θ2 > c_θ1 (typically, with c_θ1=0 for axial entry). Thus, c_θ1 (rotor entry) ≠ c_θ2 (stator entry). Statement II is incorrect.",
