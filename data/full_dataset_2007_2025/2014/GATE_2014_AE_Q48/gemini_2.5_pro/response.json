The key steps involve correctly distributing the total mass and payload between the two stages using the given structural coefficient and the condition that both stages have the same 'payload ratio'.\n\n1.  **Interpret Payload Ratio for Optimal Staging:** The condition 'both stages with same payload ratio' for a two-stage rocket with identical specific impulse and structural coefficient implies an optimal staging configuration. This means the initial mass of the second stage ($M_{i2}$) is the geometric mean of the total initial mass ($M_{i1}$) and the final payload mass ($M_L$).\n    $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{M_{i1} M_L}$\n    Given $M_{i1} = 16000$ kg and $M_L = 1000$ kg:\n    $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{16000 \\times 1000} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 10^6} = 4000$ kg.\n\n2.  **Determine Propellant and Structural Masses for Each Stage:**\n    *   The total mass of Stage 1 (propellant + structure) is the difference between the initial mass of the rocket and the initial mass of the second stage:\n        $M_{p1} + M_{s1} = M_{i1} - M_{i2} = 16000 - 4000 = 12000$ kg.\n    *   The total mass of Stage 2 (propellant + structure) is the difference between the initial mass of the second stage and the final payload mass:\n        $M_{p2} + M_{s2} = M_{i2} - M_L = 4000 - 1000 = 3000$ kg.\n    *   The structural coefficient $\\epsilon = 0.14$ is defined as $M_s / (M_s + M_p)$.
