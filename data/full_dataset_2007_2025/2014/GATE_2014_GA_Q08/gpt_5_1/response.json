Thus the quadrilateral angles are 60\\degree, 80\\degree, 100\\degree, 120\\degree; the largest is 120\\degree. Let the smallest angle of the triangle be A. Given A is two-thirds of the smallest quadrilateral angle: smallest quadrilateral angle is 60\\degree, so A = \\tfrac{2}{3} \\times 60\\degree = 40\\degree. The largest angle of the triangle is twice its smallest: 2A = 80\\degree. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180\\degree, so the third angle is 180\\degree - (40\\degree + 80\\degree) = 60\\degree. Thus the triangle angles are 40\\degree (smallest), 60\\degree (second largest), 80\\degree (largest).

The largest angle of the triangle is twice its smallest angle. What is the sum, in degrees, of the second largest angle of the triangle and the largest angle of the quadrilateral?"
