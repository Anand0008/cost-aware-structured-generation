        "reasoning": "The function `f(x)` is defined as `f(x) = sin(1/x)` for `x \\neq 0` and `f(x) = 0` for `x = 0`. We need to analyze its boundedness, continuity, and differentiability.\n\n1.  **Boundedness:**\n    For any `x \\neq 0`, the value of `sin(1/x)` is always between -1 and 1, inclusive. That is, `|sin(1/x)| \\le 1`. At `x = 0`, `f(0) = 0`, which also satisfies `|f(0)| \\le 1`. Therefore, the function `f(x)` is bounded everywhere, with `|f(x)| \\le 1` for all `x` in its domain. This rules out option A.\n\n2.  **Continuity at `x = 0`:**\n    For `f(x)` to be continuous at `x = 0`, the following condition must be met: `\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = f(0)`. We are given `f(0) = 0`. Now, let's evaluate the limit:\n    `\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} sin(1/x)`.\n    As `x` approaches `0`, the argument `1/x` approaches `\\pm \\infty`. The sine function `sin(\\theta)` oscillates infinitely between -1 and 1 as `\\theta \\to \\pm \\infty`. Therefore, `\\lim_{x \\to 0} sin(1/x)` does not exist. Since the limit does not exist, `f(x)` is not continuous at `x = 0`. This rules out options B and D.\n\n3.  **Differentiability at `x = 0` (for completeness):**\n    For `f(x)` to be differentiable at `x = 0`, the derivative `f'(0)` must exist, defined by:\n    `f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{sin(1/h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{sin(1/h)}{h}`.\n    As `h \\to 0`, `sin(1/h)` oscillates between -1 and 1, while `1/h` grows unbounded. The product `\\frac{sin(1/h)}{h}` will oscillate with increasing amplitude, and thus the limit does not exist. Therefore, `f(x)` is not differentiable at `x = 0`. This further confirms that option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the function is bounded everywhere but not continuous at `x = 0`. This matches option C."
