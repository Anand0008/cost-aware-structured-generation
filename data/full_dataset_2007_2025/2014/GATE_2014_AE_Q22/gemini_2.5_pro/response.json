        "reasoning": "The load factor ($n$) is defined as the ratio of the total vertical force acting on the aircraft to its weight ($W$). For a stationary aircraft parked in a hangar, the aircraft is in static equilibrium. This means the upward vertical ground reaction force ($R_z$) from the landing gear exactly balances the downward force of gravity (its weight, $W$). Therefore, $R_z = W$. Using the definition of vertical load factor, $n_z = R_z / W = W / W = 1$. This is a fundamental concept in aircraft loads, indicating that the aircraft is experiencing its normal weight."

          "Step 2: Analyze the aircraft's state. The question states the aircraft is 'stationary' and 'parked in its hangar'. This implies the aircraft is in static equilibrium, meaning there is no acceleration (zero vertical acceleration, $a_z = 0$).",
