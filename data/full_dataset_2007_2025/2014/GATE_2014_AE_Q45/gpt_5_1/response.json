        "reasoning": "For an ideal ramjet with equal inlet and exit static pressures and equal inlet and exit Mach numbers, the ideal relation from ramjet cycle analysis is \\(c_j = c_i \\sqrt{T_4/T_1}\\). The flight Mach number is 4 at ambient temperature 100 K. First, compute the inlet speed: \\(a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 100} \\approx 200.5\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Hence \\(c_i = M_1 a_1 = 4 \\times 200.5 \\approx 802\\,\\text{m/s}\\). With combustor stagnation temperature \\(T_4 = 2310\\,\\text{K}\\) and inlet static temperature \\(T_1 = 100\\,\\text{K}\\), the ideal exit speed is \\(c_j = 802\\,\\sqrt{2310/100} \\approx 802 \\times 4.806 \\approx 3855\\,\\text{m/s}\\) if we misinterpret \\(T_4\\) as static. However, for the ideal ramjet relation, \\(T_4\\) is the stagnation temperature after heat addition and \\(T_1\\) is the stagnation temperature before heat addition. So we must first find inlet stagnation temperature: \\(T_{01} = T_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right) = 100 \\times (1 + 0.2 \\times 16) = 100 \\times 4.2 = 420\\,\\text{K}\\). Then \\(T_{04} = 2310\\,\\text{K}\\). The ideal relation becomes \\(c_j = c_i \\sqrt{T_{04}/T_{01}} = 802 \\times \\sqrt{2310/420} = 802 \\times \\sqrt{5.5} \\approx 802 \\times 2.345 \\approx 1880\\,\\text{m/s}\\). This matches the official key range 1880–1881 m/s. The derivation is consistent with standard ramjet cycle analysis as given in gas turbine/ramjet textbooks and the RAG formulas."

Consider ratio of specific heats gamma = 1.4 and specific gas constant R = 287J/kgK. If the stagnation temperature in the combustion chamber is equal to 2310K, the speed of the exhaust gases (in m/s) is _____________."
