Given initial amplitude X1 = 5 cm and damping ratio ζ = 0.02, the logarithmic decrement δ is calculated as δ = 2πζ/√(1-ζ²). Then, the amplitude of the fifth cycle X5 = X1 * e^{-4δ}. Using ζ=0.02, δ ≈ 0.1257, e^{-4δ} ≈ e^{-0.5028} ≈ 0.605, so X5 ≈ 5 * 0.605 = 3.025 cm, which rounds to 3.02 cm. The answer key matches this calculation."
