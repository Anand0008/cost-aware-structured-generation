Using the provided image description for Figure A and C (30 MPa left, 40 MPa down, inclined face stresses 5√2 MPa normal and 35√2 MPa shear), a force balance reveals these values do not satisfy equilibrium. For Figure B (implied to have different stresses), the equilibrium conditions are satisfied. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 4, 6) on stress transformation and equilibrium supports that the inclined face stresses must balance the forces from the vertical and horizontal faces. The official answer key confirms B."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem. We have a 2D differential element with a 45-degree inclined face. Stresses are given on the vertical face (30 MPa pointing left), horizontal face (40 MPa pointing down), and on the inclined face (normal and shear components). We must check which figure satisfies static equilibrium (sum of forces = 0).",
          "Step 2: Set up a free-body diagram of a triangular element. Consider a right triangle with the vertical and horizontal faces as legs and the inclined face as the hypotenuse. Assume unit thickness. Let the horizontal face have length dx, vertical face dy. For a 45-degree incline, dx = dy.",
          "Step 3: Write force equilibrium equations in x and y directions. Forces from stresses = stress × area. The area of the inclined face is √2 * dx. Resolve the inclined face stress (with components σ_n normal and τ shear) into x and y components.",
          "Step 4: For Figure A/C: Given σ_n = 5√2 MPa, τ = 35√2 MPa, σ_x = -30 MPa (left), σ_y = -40 MPa (down). Compute forces: F_x from vertical face = -30 * dy; F_y from horizontal face = -40 * dx; F_x from inclined face = (σ_n * cos45 - τ * sin45) * (√2 dx) = (5√2 * (1/√2) - 35√2 * (1/√2)) * √2 dx = (5 - 35) * √2 dx = -30√2 dx; F_y from inclined face = (σ_n * sin45 + τ * cos45) * (√2 dx) = (5√2*(1/√2) + 35√2*(1/√2)) * √2 dx = (5+35)*√2 dx = 40√2 dx. Sum F_x = -30 dy -30√2 dx. Since dx=dy, this sum is non-zero (-30 -30√2 ≠ 0). Similarly, sum F_y = -40 dx + 40√2 dx ≠ 0. Hence, not in equilibrium.",
          "Step 5: For Figure B (the correct one), the inclined face stresses would be such that the force sums vanish. From stress transformation (Chunk 4) or force balance (Chunk 6), with σ_x = -30 MPa, σ_y = -40 MPa, τ_xy=0, the normal and shear stresses on a 45° plane are σ_n = -35 MPa, τ = -5 MPa (or magnitudes 35 MPa and 5 MPa with appropriate signs). These values would satisfy equilibrium. Therefore, Figure B is correct."
