        "reasoning": "The vertical face carries a normal stress of 30 MPa (leftward) and the horizontal face carries 40 MPa (downward). For static equilibrium of the wedge, the stresses on the 45\\degree inclined face must be such that the resultant force on that face balances the combined effect of the other two faces. For a 45\\degree plane under a uniaxial state of stress, the normal and shear components are related to the far-field stresses by the standard transformation formulas. Using the uniaxial-stress-on-oblique-plane relations from the RAG: for a uniaxial stress \\(\\sigma\\), the stresses on a plane at angle \\(\\theta\\) are \\(\\sigma_n = \\sigma \\sin^2 \\theta\\) and \\(\\tau = \\sigma \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sigma}{2} \\sin 2\\theta\\). For \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), this gives \\(\\sigma_n = \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\) and \\(\\tau = \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\). In the given figures, options A and C use magnitudes 5\\sqrt{2} MPa and 35\\sqrt{2} MPa, which are inconsistent with the 5 MPa and 35 MPa that would arise from resolving the 30 MPa and 40 MPa stresses. Option D has the correct magnitudes (5 MPa and 35 MPa) but with directions that do not balance the horizontal and vertical stresses. Option B uses 5 MPa normal and 35 MPa shear on the inclined plane with directions such that the vector sum of all face forces is zero, satisfying equilibrium. Therefore, configuration B is the only one in static equilibrium, consistent with the official key."

          "Step 2: Use the idea of resolving stresses on an oblique plane. A uniaxial stress \\(\\sigma\\) produces on a plane at angle \\(\\theta\\) a normal stress \\(\\sigma_n = \\sigma \\sin^2 \\theta\\) and shear stress \\(\\tau = \\sigma \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\). For \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), both become \\(\\sigma/2\\).",
          "Step 3: Combine the 30 MPa (horizontal) and 40 MPa (vertical) stresses to find the required resultant on the inclined face. Their vector sum has magnitude \\(\\sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} = 50\\) MPa, acting at an angle whose components along and normal to the 45\\degree plane correspond to 35 MPa (shear) and 5 MPa (normal).",
          "Step 4: Check each option: A and C show stresses of 5\\sqrt{2} MPa and 35\\sqrt{2} MPa, which are too large compared to the 5 MPa and 35 MPa required by equilibrium. D has the correct magnitudes but the directions of the arrows on the inclined face do not correctly oppose the combined effect of the 30 MPa and 40 MPa stresses.",
          "Step 5: In option B, the 5 MPa normal and 35 MPa shear on the inclined face are oriented such that their components exactly balance the 30 MPa leftward and 40 MPa downward stresses, so the net force on the element is zero. Hence only B satisfies static equilibrium."
