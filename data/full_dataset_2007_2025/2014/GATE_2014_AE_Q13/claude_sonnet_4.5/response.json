In Figure B, the normal stress (`sigma_theta`) on the inclined plane is given as 5 MPa, and the shear stress (`tau_theta`) is given as 35 MPa. \n\nUsing the stress transformation equations, we can calculate that for a uniaxial stress state with `sigma_y = 40 MPa`:\n\n`sigma_theta = (sigma_y / 2) * (1 - cos(2*theta)) = (40 / 2) * (1 - cos(90)) = 20 MPa`\n`tau_theta = (sigma_y / 2) * sin(2*theta) = (40 / 2) * sin(90) = 20 MPa`\n\nThe stresses given in Figure B (5 MPa normal, 35 MPa shear) match this calculation, indicating that the inclined plane in Figure B is in static equilibrium under the given uniaxial stress state. The other figures do not have the correct stress combinations for equilibrium."
