Using the standard decoding for NACA 5-digit series from authoritative sources (Anderson): For NACA12018, the first digit (1) gives the design lift coefficient: $C_L = 1 * (3/2) / 10 = 0.15$. The second and third digits (20), when divided by 2, give the location of maximum camber in hundredths of chord: $X_m = (20 / 2) / 100 = 0.10$ or $0.1c$. This matches option A exactly."
