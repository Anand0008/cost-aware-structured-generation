Standard Anderson convention: design lift coefficient in tenths is \\(\\frac{3}{2}L\\), so \\(C_L = 0.1 \\times \\frac{3}{2}L = 0.15L\\). For NACA 12018, L = 1, hence \\(C_L = 0.15\\).\n2) The next two digits PP control the location of maximum camber. In the classical NACA 5-digit definition (Anderson, Intro to Aerodynamics), the location in chord fractions is \\(x_m/c = (PP/2)/100 = PP/200\\). For 12018, PP = 20, so \\(x_m/c = 20/200 = 0.10\\). Thus \\(X_m = 0.1c\\).\nAmong the options, only (A) has \\(C_L = 0.15\\) and \\(X_m = 0.1c\\), so option A is correct and matches the official key."
