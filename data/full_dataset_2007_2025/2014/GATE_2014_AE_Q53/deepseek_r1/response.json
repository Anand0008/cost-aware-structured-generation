        "reasoning": "Maximum rate-of-climb for a jet-propelled airplane depends on excess power, which is influenced by thrust, drag, and weight. Wing loading (P) affects drag through the lift coefficient; maximum thrust-to-weight ratio (Q) provides the driving force; zero-lift drag coefficient (R) contributes to parasitic drag; and maximum lift-to-drag ratio (S) indicates aerodynamic efficiency affecting drag at climb conditions. Analytical derivation from rate-of-climb equation shows dependency on all four parameters."

          "Step 4: For climb performance, lift approximately equals weight: $L = W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. Thus, $C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S} = \\frac{W/S}{0.5 \\rho V^2}$, showing dependence on wing loading (W/S).",
          "Step 5: Substitute into drag equation: D depends on W/S, $C_{D,0}$, and induced drag factor $K = 1/(\\pi e AR)$, which relates to maximum L/D ($L/D_{max}$ is optimized when $C_{D,0} = C_{D,i}$).",
