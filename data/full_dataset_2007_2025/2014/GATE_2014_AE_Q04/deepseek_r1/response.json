Option B involves the integral of derivatives, which is not guaranteed by standard Sturm-Liouville orthogonality. Option C claims the integral is non-zero, which contradicts the orthogonality. Option D combines the product of functions and derivatives, which does not generally vanish. Therefore, only option A is correct."
