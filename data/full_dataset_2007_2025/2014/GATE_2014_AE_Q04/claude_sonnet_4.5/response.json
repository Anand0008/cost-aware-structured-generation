This is a property of the eigenfunctions (solutions) of a Sturm-Liouville problem, which this boundary value problem can be shown to be.\n\nMathematically, the orthogonality condition is expressed as:\n$\\int_0^1 y_1(x) y_5(x) dx = 0$\n\nThis is because the solutions `y_1` and `y_5` correspond to different eigenvalues `k = 1` and `k = 5`, respectively. The orthogonality of the eigenfunctions is a fundamental property that allows for the separation of variables technique to work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A."
