Recognize that f(x) is an odd function, so the Fourier cosine coefficients a_n are zero, and the series simplifies to only the sine coefficients b_n.\n2. Calculate the b_n coefficients using the Euler formulas for Fourier series with period 2pi.\n3. Substitute x = pi/2 into the Fourier series, which gives the Leibniz formula for pi/4.\nTherefore, the sum s converges to pi/4, which matches the correct answer provided in the answer key."
