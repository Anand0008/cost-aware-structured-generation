For an odd function over a symmetric interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, the Fourier coefficients $a_0$ and $a_n$ are zero.\n\n1.  **Identify the function type:** $f(x)$ is an odd function.\n2.  **Calculate Fourier coefficients:**\n    *   $a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) dx = 0$ (integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval).\n    *   $a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(nx) dx = 0$ (product of odd $f(x)$ and even $\\cos(nx)$ is odd).\n    *   $b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$. Since $f(x)\\sin(nx)$ is an even function (odd $\\times$ odd = even), we can write:\n        $b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$\n        For $0 < x < \\pi$, $f(x) = 2$.\n        $b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 2 \\sin(nx) dx = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(nx)}{n} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi}$\n        $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [-\\cos(n\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))] = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [1 - \\cos(n\\pi)]$\n        Since $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n$, we have:\n        $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [1 - (-1)^n]$\n\n3.  **Determine $b_n$ for even and odd $n$:**\n    *   If $n$ is even (e.g., $n=2, 4, \\dots$), then $(-1)^n = 1$, so $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} (1 - 1) = 0$.\n    *   If $n$ is odd (e.g., $n=1, 3, 5, \\dots$), then $(-1)^n = -1$, so $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} (1 - (-1)) = \\frac{8}{\\pi n}$.\n\n4.  **Write the Fourier series:**\n    $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1, n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx) = \\sum_{n=1, n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{\\pi n} \\sin(nx)$\n    $f(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(x)}{1} + \\frac{\\sin(3x)}{3} + \\frac{\\sin(5x)}{5} + \\dots \\right)$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the series at a specific point to find the sum $s$:**\n    The target sum is $s = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + \\dots$. This suggests evaluating the Fourier series at $x = \\pi/2$.\n    At $x = \\pi/2$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous, and $f(\\pi/2) = 2$.\n    Substitute $x = \\pi/2$ into the Fourier series:\n    $f(\\pi/2) = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\pi/2)}{1} + \\frac{\\sin(3\\pi/2)}{3} + \\frac{\\sin(5\\pi/2)}{5} + \\dots \\right)$\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{-1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{-1}{7} + \\dots \\right)$\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\dots \\right)$\n    The series in the parenthesis is exactly $s$.\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} s$\n    $s = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the sum $s$ converges to $\\pi/4$, which corresponds to option C."
