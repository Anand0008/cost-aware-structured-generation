The provided image clearly shows a closed path (A-B-C-D-A) that does not encircle the central vortex core. The vortex core is outside the region bounded by the path. Since the flow outside the core of a line vortex is irrotational, the net circulation along this path must be zero, as per Stokes' theorem. A detailed line integral calculation also confirms this result."

Thus, their dot product $\\vec{V} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = 0$. Therefore, the contribution to circulation from these segments is zero.",
          "For the tangential segments (B-C and D-A), the differential displacement vector is $d\\vec{l} = r d\\theta \\hat{e}_{\\theta}$. The dot product is $\\vec{V} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}\\right) (r d\\theta) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} d\\theta$.",
          "Calculate the integral for each tangential segment. Let $\\theta_A, \\theta_B, \\theta_C, \\theta_D$ be the angular positions. From the figure, the radial segments A-B and C-D imply that the starting angle for B is the same as A (i.e., $\\theta_B = \\theta_A$), and the starting angle for D is the same as C (i.e., $\\theta_D = \\theta_C$).",
          "Integral along B-C: $\\int_{B}^{C} \\vec{V} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\int_{\\theta_B}^{\\theta_C} \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} (\\theta_C - \\theta_B) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} (\\theta_C - \\theta_A)$.

          "Alternatively, and more fundamentally, recall that a potential line vortex flow is irrotational everywhere *outside* its core (singularity).
