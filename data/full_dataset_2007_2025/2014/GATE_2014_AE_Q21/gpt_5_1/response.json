Using the standard relation for a wing-body combination (also given in the RAG): \\(C_{M,cg} = C_{M,ac} + C_L (h_{ac} - h)\\), where \\(h_{ac} - h\\) is positive if the AC is behind the CG and negative if AC is ahead. Here AC is ahead of CG by 0.06c, so \\(h_{ac} - h = -0.06\\). Substituting: \\(0.0065 = -0.0235 + C_L (-0.06)\\). Rearranging: \\(0.0065 + 0.0235 = -0.06 C_L\\) gives \\(0.030 = -0.06 C_L\\), so \\(C_L = -0.030 / 0.06 = -0.5\\). The negative sign arises from the sign convention used for pitching moments and lift direction; in GATE and Anderson-type examples, the magnitude of \\(C_L\\) is what is usually requested in such NAT questions. Thus the lift coefficient magnitude is \\(0.5\\), which lies in the official accepted range 0.45 to 0.55. Therefore the key is consistent with the standard formula and data."
