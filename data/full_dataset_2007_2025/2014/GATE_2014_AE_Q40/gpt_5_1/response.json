        "reasoning": "The member is axially restrained at both ends. As temperature increases, free expansion is prevented, inducing a uniform compressive thermal stress. Buckling will occur when this compressive stress reaches the Euler critical buckling stress for a fixed–fixed column. For a prismatic bar, the thermally induced stress is $\\sigma_T = E \\\\alpha \\\\Delta T$. The Euler critical stress is $\\\\sigma_{cr} = \\\\dfrac{P_{cr}}{A} = \\\\dfrac{4 \\\\pi^2 E I}{A L^2}$ for fixed–fixed ends (effective length $L_e = L/2$). Setting $\\\\sigma_T = \\\\sigma_{cr}$ and solving for $\\\\Delta T$ gives $\\\\Delta T = \\\\dfrac{4 \\\\pi^2 I}{A L^2 \\\\alpha}$. For a rectangle 10 mm $\\\\times$ 6 mm, the weaker bending axis is about the 6 mm side, so take $b = 10$ mm, $h = 6$ mm: $A = 60 \\\\text{mm}^2$, $I = \\\\dfrac{b h^3}{12} = 180 \\\\text{mm}^4$. With $L = 1000$ mm and $\\\\alpha = 12 \\\\times 10^{-6} / \\\\degree C$, we get\n$\\\\Delta T = \\\\dfrac{4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\times 180}{60 \\\\times (1000)^2 \\\\times 12 \\\\times 10^{-6}} \\\\approx 9.87 \\\\degree C$.
