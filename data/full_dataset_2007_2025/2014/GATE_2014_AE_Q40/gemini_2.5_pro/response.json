        "reasoning": "The problem requires finding the temperature increase $\\Delta T$ at which a structural member, rigidly fixed at both ends, will buckle. This involves two main principles:\n1.  **Thermal Stress:** An increase in temperature in a rigidly fixed bar induces compressive stress. The thermal stress ($\\sigma_T$) is given by $\\sigma_T = E \\alpha \\Delta T$.\n2.  **Euler Buckling:** A column under axial compressive load will buckle when the compressive stress reaches the critical buckling stress ($\\sigma_{cr}$). For a column with fixed-fixed ends, the critical buckling stress is $\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2 A}$, where $K=0.5$ for fixed-fixed ends.\n\nEquating the thermal stress to the critical buckling stress will give the $\\Delta T$ at which buckling occurs.\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Cross-section dimensions: $b = 10 \\text{ mm}$, $h = 6 \\text{ mm}$\n*   Length: $L = 1 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}$\n*   Young's Modulus: $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n*   Coefficient of thermal expansion: $\\alpha = 12 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ C$\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n1.  **Calculate Cross-sectional Area (A):**\n    $A = b \\times h = 10 \\text{ mm} \\times 6 \\text{ mm} = 60 \\text{ mm}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate Minimum Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    Buckling will occur about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia. For a rectangular cross-section, the moments of inertia are $\\frac{bh^3}{12}$ and $\\frac{hb^3}{12}$.\n    *   $I_1 = \\frac{10 \\text{ mm} \\times (6 \\text{ mm})^3}{12} = \\frac{10 \\times 216}{12} = 10 \\times 18 = 180 \\text{ mm}^4$\n    *   $I_2 = \\frac{6 \\text{ mm} \\times (10 \\text{ mm})^3}{12} = \\frac{6 \\times 1000}{12} = 500 \\text{ mm}^4$\n    The minimum moment of inertia is $I = 180 \\text{ mm}^4$.\n\n3.  **Determine Effective Length Factor (K):**\n    The problem states the member is \"rigidly fixed at both the ends\". For buckling analysis, this implies fixed-fixed end conditions, for which the effective length factor $K = 0.5$.\n\n4.  **Equate Thermal Stress and Critical Buckling Stress:**\n    $\\sigma_T = \\sigma_{cr}$\n    $E \\alpha \\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2 A}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\Delta T$:**\n    $\\alpha \\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 I}{(K L)^2 A}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 I}{\\alpha (K L)^2 A}$\n    Substitute the values:\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 180 \\text{ mm}^4}{(12 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ C) \\times (0.5 \\times 1000 \\text{ mm})^2 \\times 60 \\text{ mm}^2}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 180}{(12 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (500)^2 \\times 60}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 180}{(12 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (250000) \\times 60}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 180}{12 \\times 0.25 \\times 60}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 180}{180}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\pi^2$\n\n    Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$\n    $\\Delta T \\approx 9.87 \\ ^\\circ C$\n\nThis value matches option B."

The ambiguity regarding 'rigidly fixed' vs. image 'pinned' was a point of interpretation, but the RAG provided the necessary formulas for both scenarios, allowing for verification against options."
