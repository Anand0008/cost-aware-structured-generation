Chunk 5 covered buckling but for open sections and flexural-torsional mode, not directly relevant. Thus, thermal stress formula was sourced from RAG, but buckling analysis relied on internal knowledge. RAG relevance is moderate (0.5) because it provided partial needed formulas."

It is rigidly fixed at both the ends and then subjected to a gradual increase in temperature. Ignoring the three dimensional effects, the structural member will buckle if the temperature is increased by Delta T deg C which is"
