Calculate the stagnation pressure ($P_{t5}$) using the isentropic relation between stagnation temperature and pressure, applying it to the actual turbine inlet ($T_{t4}, P_{t4}$) and actual turbine exit ($T_{t5}$) conditions.\n\nWhile a turbine with an efficiency less than 1 is not truly isentropic, for GATE problems of this nature, if the provided efficiency leads to a result outside the given range, it is often implied that the actual temperature ratio should be directly used in the isentropic pressure-temperature relation to find the corresponding pressure.
