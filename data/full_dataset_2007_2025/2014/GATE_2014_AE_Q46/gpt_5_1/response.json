        "reasoning": "We are given turbine inlet total conditions, turbine exit static temperature and velocity, and total-to-total efficiency. The nozzle stagnation pressure equals the turbine exit stagnation pressure for an adiabatic duct with no work. Steps:\n1) Compute ideal (isentropic) turbine exit total temperature using total-to-total efficiency: \\(\\eta_{tt} = \\dfrac{T_{t3}-T_{t4}}{T_{t3}-T_{4}}\\). Here station 3 is turbine inlet, 4 is turbine exit. Given: \\(T_{t3}=1350\\,K\\), actual static exit \\(T_4=800\\,K\\), \\(\\eta_{tt}=0.96\\). Solve for \\(T_{t4}\\):\n\\(T_{t4} = T_{t3} - \\eta_{tt}(T_{t3}-T_4) = 1350 - 0.96(1350-800) = 1350 - 0.96\\times 550 = 1350 - 528 = 822\\,K.\\)\n2) For an isentropic turbine, relate total temperatures to total pressures: \\(\\dfrac{T_{t4}}{T_{t3}} = \\left(\\dfrac{p_{t4}}{p_{t3}}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}\\). Rearranging: \\(p_{t4} = p_{t3} \\left(\\dfrac{T_{t4}}{T_{t3}}\\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}\\). With \\(p_{t3}=10\\,bar\\), \\(T_{t4}/T_{t3} = 822/1350 \\approx 0.609\\), \\(\\gamma=1.33\\), exponent \\(\\gamma/(\\gamma-1) = 1.33/0.33 \\approx 4.03\\).\n3) Compute pressure ratio: \\(\\left(0.609\\right)^{4.03} \\approx 0.118\\). Thus \\(p_{t4} \\approx 10 \\times 0.118 \\approx 1.18\\,bar\\).\n4) The nozzle is isentropic, so its inlet stagnation pressure is this \\(p_{t4}\\). Therefore the stagnation pressure in the nozzle is about 1.2 bar, which lies within the official range 1.10 to 1.25 bar."
