Calculate the stagnation temperature at the nozzle exit, T_t5:\n   T_t5 = T_5 / (1 - (V_5^2 / (2 * c_p * T_5)))\n   T_t5 = 800 / (1 - (200^2 / (2 * 1.147 * 800))) = 923.5 K\n\n2. Use the isentropic relation to find the stagnation pressure at the nozzle exit, P_t5:\n   P_t5 = P_03 * (T_t5 / T_03)^(γ / (γ - 1))\n   P_t5 = 10 * (923.5 / 1350)^(1.33 / (1.33 - 1)) = 1.18 bar\n\nTherefore, the stagnation pressure at the nozzle (considering isentropic nozzle) is between 1.10 and 1.25 bar, which matches the correct answer provided."
