For any fixed \\theta less than \\theta_{\\max}(M), there are two solutions for \\beta: a weak-shock solution (smaller \\beta) and a strong-shock solution (larger \\beta). From standard theta-beta-M charts (or by qualitative analysis of the equation), as M decreases from a high supersonic value while keeping \\theta fixed, the weak-shock branch moves to larger \\beta (shock becomes more normal), whereas the strong-shock branch moves to smaller \\beta. Thus, only for the strong-shock solution does \\beta decrease with decreasing M. Therefore statement (B) is correct and the others are incorrect."
