This behavior is consistently observed in $\\theta-\\beta-M$ diagrams and is explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 3: 'Decreasing the upstream Mach number M1 for a fixed deflection angle theta will cause the wave angle beta to increase, making the shock stronger.'). Therefore, the physically correct statement is '$\\beta$ will increase for both weak and strong shocks', which corresponds to Option C. However, the provided answer key states B. If we were to assume B is correct, it would imply a non-standard or highly specific scenario not generally covered by oblique shock theory, where $\\beta$ for a strong shock decreases with decreasing M. Given the standard theory, Option C is the correct physical answer, and Option B is incorrect."
