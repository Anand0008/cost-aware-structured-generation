        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the correct statements regarding the drag experienced by four different objects in a steady, uniform, viscous, and incompressible 2-D flow. We need to analyze each statement based on the principles of drag, streamlining, and the effect of surface roughness on boundary layers and flow separation.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1.  **Streamlining vs. Blunt Bodies:** Streamlined bodies (like object (b) and (c)) are designed to minimize pressure drag by delaying flow separation, resulting in a smaller wake. Blunt bodies (like object (a) and (d)) experience early flow separation, leading to a large wake and high pressure drag. Generally, for comparable frontal areas, streamlined bodies have significantly less total drag than blunt bodies (RAG Chunk 1, Figure 5.76; RAG Chunk 6, Figure 4.37).\n2.  **Surface Roughness:**\n    *   **For Streamlined Bodies (e.g., airfoils, object (b) and (c)):** Surface roughness primarily increases friction drag. It generally does not significantly alter the pressure drag, as separation is already delayed. Therefore, a rough streamlined body will have higher drag than a smooth one.\n    *   **For Blunt Bodies (e.g., cylinders, spheres, object (a) and (d)):** The effect of roughness is more complex and depends on the Reynolds number. At subcritical Reynolds numbers, roughness increases drag. However, at or near the 'critical Reynolds number' (typically $Re \\approx 2 \\times 10^5$ to $5 \\times 10^5$ for a smooth cylinder), roughness can *trip* the laminar boundary layer into turbulence earlier. A turbulent boundary layer has more momentum and is more resistant to separation than a laminar boundary layer, causing the separation point to move further downstream on the body. This results in a significantly smaller wake and a substantial reduction in pressure drag. This reduction in pressure drag often *outweighs* the increase in friction drag due to roughness, leading to a *net decrease* in total drag for the rough blunt body compared to a smooth one (RAG Chunk 1, Figure 5.74, 5.75).\n\n**Analysis of Statements:**\n*   **Object (a): Smooth Cylinder** - Blunt body, laminar boundary layer separation occurs relatively early, leading to a large wake and high pressure drag.\n*   **Object (b): Smooth Streamlined Body** - Streamlined, smooth surface, designed for low pressure drag, with friction drag being the primary component.\n*   **Object (c): Rough Streamlined Body** - Streamlined, rough surface. Compared to (b), the roughness will increase friction drag, leading to higher total drag.\n*   **Object (d): Rough Cylinder** - Blunt body, rough surface. Assuming the flow is in the critical Reynolds number regime (which is a common scenario for such comparisons in viscous flow problems), the roughness will cause the boundary layer to become turbulent earlier, delaying separation, reducing the wake size, and thus significantly reducing pressure drag compared to the smooth cylinder (a).\n\n**Evaluating each statement:**\n*   **(i) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (d)**:\n    *   (a) is a smooth cylinder, (d) is a rough cylinder. As discussed, a rough cylinder (d) can have significantly *less* drag than a smooth cylinder (a) due to the 'drag crisis' phenomenon, where roughness induces early transition to a turbulent boundary layer, delaying separation and reducing pressure drag. Thus, Drag(a) > Drag(d) is **TRUE**.\n*   **(ii) Drag of object (a) is less than the drag of object (d)**:\n    *   This is the opposite of statement (i). Based on the drag crisis phenomenon, this statement is **FALSE**.\n*   **(iii) Drag of object (b) is more than the drag of object (c)**:\n    *   (b) is a smooth streamlined body, (c) is a rough streamlined body. Roughness on a streamlined body increases friction drag. Therefore, Drag(c) > Drag(b). This statement (Drag(b) > Drag(c)) is **FALSE**.\n*   **(iv) Drag of object (c) is more than the drag of object (b)**:\n    *   As explained for (iii), roughness on a streamlined body increases friction drag. Therefore, Drag(c) > Drag(b) is **TRUE**.\n*   **(v) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (b)**:\n    *   (a) is a blunt cylinder, (b) is a streamlined body. Streamlined bodies are designed to have much lower drag than blunt bodies of comparable frontal area due to significantly reduced pressure drag. Thus, Drag(a) > Drag(b) is **TRUE**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct statements are (i), (iv), and (v). This corresponds to option C."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the nature of drag.** Recall that total drag is composed of pressure drag (form drag) and friction drag (skin friction drag). Pressure drag is dominant for blunt bodies due to flow separation and wake formation, while friction drag is more significant for streamlined bodies.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze the effect of streamlining.** Compare object (a) (blunt cylinder) with object (b) (streamlined body). Streamlining reduces pressure drag significantly by delaying flow separation. Therefore, a streamlined body will have substantially less drag than a blunt body of similar frontal area. This helps evaluate statement (v).",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the effect of surface roughness on streamlined bodies.** Compare object (b) (smooth streamlined) with object (c) (rough streamlined). For streamlined bodies, surface roughness primarily increases friction drag. It does not significantly alter the pressure distribution or separation point. Thus, a rough streamlined body will experience more drag than a smooth one. This helps evaluate statements (iii) and (iv).",
          "**Step 4: Analyze the effect of surface roughness on blunt bodies (drag crisis).** Compare object (a) (smooth cylinder) with object (d) (rough cylinder). For blunt bodies like cylinders, at certain Reynolds numbers (the critical Reynolds number regime), surface roughness can trigger an earlier transition of the laminar boundary layer to a turbulent boundary layer. A turbulent boundary layer is more energetic and resistant to separation, causing the separation point to move further downstream on the body. This significantly reduces the size of the wake and, consequently, the pressure drag. This reduction in pressure drag often outweighs the increase in friction drag due to roughness, leading to a net *decrease* in total drag for the rough blunt body compared to a smooth one. This phenomenon is known as the 'drag crisis'. This helps evaluate statements (i) and (ii).",
          "**Step 5: Evaluate each given statement based on the above principles.**\n    *   (i) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (d): TRUE (due to drag crisis).\n    *   (ii) Drag of object (a) is less than the drag of object (d): FALSE.\n    *   (iii) Drag of object (b) is more than the drag of object (c): FALSE (roughness increases drag for streamlined bodies).\n    *   (iv) Drag of object (c) is more than the drag of object (b): TRUE (roughness increases drag for streamlined bodies).\n    *   (v) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (b): TRUE (blunt bodies have higher drag than streamlined bodies).",

(i) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (d) (ii) Drag of object (a) is less than the drag of object (d) (iii) Drag of object (b) is more than the drag of object (c) (iv) Drag of object (c) is more than the drag of object (b) (v) Drag of object (a) is more than the drag of object (b).
