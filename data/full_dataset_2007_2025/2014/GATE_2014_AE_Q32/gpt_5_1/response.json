For 2-D viscous incompressible flow at the same speed and size scale, drag is dominated by pressure drag for bluff bodies (cylinders) and by skin-friction drag for streamlined bodies.\n1) Cylinder vs streamlined body: A smooth cylinder (a) has large separated wake and high pressure drag. A streamlined body (b) has delayed separation and small wake, so total drag is much smaller. Thus drag(a) >> drag(b). Statement (v) \"Drag of object (a) is more than drag of object (b)\" is true.\n2) Smooth vs rough streamlined body: For a streamlined body, separation is already very far downstream; roughness mainly increases skin friction without giving any significant benefit in pressure drag. Hence rough streamlined body (c) has higher drag than smooth streamlined body (b). So drag(c) > drag(b). Therefore statement (iv) is true and statement (iii) is false.\n3) Smooth vs rough cylinder: For a circular cylinder, surface roughness can trigger earlier transition to turbulent boundary layer, which delays separation and reduces wake size and pressure drag (critical Reynolds number effect). Thus a rough cylinder (d) generally has lower drag than a smooth cylinder (a) at typical high Reynolds numbers. Therefore drag(a) > drag(d). So statement (i) is true and statement (ii) is false.\nCombining, the correct set of true statements is (i), (iv), (v), which corresponds to option C."
