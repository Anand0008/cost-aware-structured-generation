(iv) For streamlined bodies or surfaces where skin friction drag is significant, roughness increases skin friction drag, so rough surface (c) has more drag than smooth surface (b).

          "Step 3: Understand the effect of surface roughness: Roughness trips the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent earlier. A turbulent boundary layer has more momentum near the wall, resisting adverse pressure gradients better, thus delaying separation for bluff bodies and reducing pressure drag. However, for streamlined bodies, where separation is minimal, roughness primarily increases skin friction drag.",
          "Step 4: Apply these principles to each comparison: (i) Cylinder comparison: Roughness reduces drag for cylinders by delaying separation, so smooth cylinder (a) has higher drag than rough cylinder (d). (ii) Opposite of (i), so false. (iii) & (iv) Surface comparison: For surfaces, roughness increases drag, so rough surface (c) has higher drag than smooth surface (b); thus (iii) false, (iv) true. (v) Cylinder vs smooth surface: Bluff bodies like cylinders have much higher drag than streamlined bodies due to severe flow separation, so drag of (a) > drag of (b).",
