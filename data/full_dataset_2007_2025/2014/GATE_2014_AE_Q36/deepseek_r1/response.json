With I=0, w = Γ0/(4s). Induced drag D_i = ρ ∫ Γ w dz = ρ w ∫ Γ dz. Using Γ(z) = Γ0 √(1 - z²/s²) and ∫_{-s}^{s} √(1 - z²/s²) dz = π s / 2 (from standard integral or given hint), ∫ Γ dz = Γ0 * (π s / 2) = π Γ0 s / 2. Thus, D_i = ρ * (Γ0/(4s)) * (π Γ0 s / 2) = π ρ Γ0² / 8. This matches option C: I=0 and D_i = π ρ Γ0² / 8."

Given Gamma^2/Gamma_0^2 + z^2/s^2 = 1, where z, Gamma_0 and s are given in figure below. For the above semi-elliptic distribution of circulation, Gamma, the downwash velocity at any point z1, for symmetric flight can be obtained as, w(z1) = Gamma_0/(4pi s) [pi + z1 I], where I = z1 integral from -s to s dz / (sqrt(s^2 - z^2) (z - z1)). Which of the following options is correct if the induced drag is D_i (given integral from -s to s (1 - z^2/s^2) dz = pi s / 2)"
