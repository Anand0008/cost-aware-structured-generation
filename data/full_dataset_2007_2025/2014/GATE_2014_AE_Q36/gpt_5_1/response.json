        "reasoning": "The given circulation distribution satisfies \\(\\Gamma^2/\\Gamma_0^2 + z^2/s^2 = 1\\), so \\(\\Gamma(z) = \\Gamma_0\\sqrt{1 - z^2/s^2}\\), a semi-ellipse in spanwise coordinate \\(z\\). This is analogous to the classic elliptic circulation distribution in lifting-line theory, which produces constant downwash along the span. The expression for downwash is \\(w(z_1) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4\\pi s}[\\pi + z_1 I]\\). For downwash to be independent of \\(z_1\\), the term multiplying \\(z_1\\) must vanish, so \\(I = 0\\). Thus \\(w = \\Gamma_0/(4s)\\), a constant. \nThe induced drag of a lifting line is \\(D_i = \\rho \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) w(z)\\,dz\\). Substituting \\(w = \\Gamma_0/(4s)\\) and \\(\\Gamma(z) = \\Gamma_0\\sqrt{1 - z^2/s^2}\\), we get\n\\[D_i = \\rho \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4s} \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma_0\\sqrt{1 - z^2/s^2}\\,dz = \\rho \\frac{\\Gamma_0^2}{4s} \\int_{-s}^{s} \\sqrt{1 - z^2/s^2}\\,dz.\\]\nThe given integral in the question is \\(\\int_{-s}^{s} (1 - z^2/s^2)\\,dz = \\pi s/2\\). This corresponds to \\(\\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma^2/\\Gamma_0^2\\,dz\\), not \\(\\int \\Gamma\\,dz\\). Using \\(\\Gamma^2 = \\Gamma_0^2(1 - z^2/s^2)\\), we can instead write the induced drag directly as\n\\[D_i = \\rho \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) w(z)\\,dz = \\rho w \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z)\\,dz.\\]\nBut a more convenient route is to use the standard lifting-line result for an elliptic distribution: \\(C_{D,i} = C_L^2/(\\pi AR)\\). For a semi-span \\(s\\), the full span is \\(b = 2s\\). The total lift is \\(L = \\rho V_\\infty \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z)\\,dz\\). Using the given relation \\(\\int_{-s}^{s} (1 - z^2/s^2)\\,dz = \\pi s/2\\) and \\(\\Gamma^2 = \\Gamma_0^2(1 - z^2/s^2)\\), we find\n\\[\\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma^2\\,dz = \\Gamma_0^2 \\int_{-s}^{s} (1 - z^2/s^2)\\,dz = \\Gamma_0^2 \\frac{\\pi s}{2}.\\]\nFor constant downwash, the induced drag can be written as \\(D_i = \\rho w \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z)\\,dz\\), but also, from lifting-line theory, \\(D_i = \\rho/(4\\pi) \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) \\int_{-s}^{s} (d\\Gamma/dz')/(z - z')\\,dz'\\,dz\\). For the elliptic case, this reduces to a simple proportionality to \\(\\int \\Gamma^2 dz\\). Matching dimensions and using the given integral, the result is \\(D_i = \\pi \\rho \\Gamma_0^2/8\\). This matches option C with \\(I = 0\\) and \\(D_i = \\pi \\rho \\Gamma_0^2/8\\)."
