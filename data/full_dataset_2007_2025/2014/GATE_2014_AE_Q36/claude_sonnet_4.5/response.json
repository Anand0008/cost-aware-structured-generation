This is the correct answer based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. For an elliptic lift distribution, the downwash w is constant across the span and given by $w = \\Gamma_0/(2b)$. \n2. Substituting this into the given formula for w(z1), we get $\\Gamma_0/(4\\pi s) [\\pi + z1 I] = \\Gamma_0/(2b)$, which simplifies to $I = 0$.\n3. The induced drag coefficient is given by $C_{D,i} = C_L^2/(\\pi AR)$. For an elliptic lift distribution, $C_L = 2\\pi\\alpha/(1 + 2/AR)$. \n4. Substituting these expressions, we get $C_{D,i} = (2\\pi\\alpha)^2/(\\pi(1 + 2/AR)^2) = \\pi\\rho\\Gamma_0^2/(8\\rho V_\\infty^2 S) = \\pi\\rho\\Gamma_0^2/8$, which matches Option C.\n\nTherefore, the analysis confirms that Option C is the correct answer."
