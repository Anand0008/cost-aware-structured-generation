        "reasoning": "Minimum sink rate for a glider refers to the flight condition where the aircraft loses altitude at the slowest possible rate, thereby maximizing its time airborne (endurance). The sink rate, $V_{\\text{sink}}$, can be expressed as a function of the aircraft's weight ($W$), wing area ($S$), air density ($\\rho$), and its aerodynamic coefficients ($C_L$ and $C_D$). The derived formula for sink rate is $V_{\\text{sink}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S}} \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$. To achieve minimum sink rate, the term $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$ must be minimized. This is equivalent to maximizing the inverse ratio, $\\frac{C_L^{3/2}}{C_D}$. Therefore, option D, \"Minimum C_D / C_L^(3/2)\", correctly states the condition for minimum sink rate."

          "Step 3: Express sink rate in terms of aerodynamic coefficients. Through force balance and the lift equation, assuming small glide angles, the sink rate can be derived as $V_{\\text{sink}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S}} \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$. Here, $W$ is weight, $\\rho$ is air density, and $S$ is wing area.",
          "Step 4: Identify the aerodynamic term to optimize. To minimize $V_{\\text{sink}}$, the aerodynamic term $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$ must be minimized, as the other terms (weight, density, wing area) are constant for a given flight condition.",
          "Step 5: Compare with the given options. Option D states \"Minimum C_D / C_L^(3/2)\", which directly matches the condition derived in Step 4. This is also equivalent to maximizing $\\frac{C_L^{3/2}}{C_D}$."
