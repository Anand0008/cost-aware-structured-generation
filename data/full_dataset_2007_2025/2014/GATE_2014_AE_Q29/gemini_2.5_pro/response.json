        "reasoning": "The problem is a second-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients and boundary conditions. The solution involves finding the complementary solution ($u_h(x)$) and a particular solution ($u_p(x)$), then combining them to form the general solution $u(x) = u_h(x) + u_p(x)$. Finally, the given boundary conditions are applied to determine the arbitrary constants. \\n\\n1.  **Rewrite the ODE:** The given ODE is $-9 \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + u = 5x$. Dividing by -9, we get $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{9}u = -\\frac{5}{9}x$.\\n2.  **Homogeneous Solution ($u_h(x)$):** The characteristic equation for $u'' - \\frac{1}{9}u = 0$ is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{9} = 0$, which gives $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $u_h(x) = C_1 e^{x/3} + C_2 e^{-x/3}$.\\n3.  **Particular Solution ($u_p(x)$):** For the non-homogeneous term $5x$, we assume a particular solution of the form $u_p(x) = Ax + B$. Differentiating, $u_p'(x) = A$ and $u_p''(x) = 0$. Substituting into the original ODE: $-9(0) + (Ax + B) = 5x$. This implies $Ax + B = 5x$, so $A=5$ and $B=0$. Hence, $u_p(x) = 5x$.\\n4.  **General Solution ($u(x)$):** Combining the homogeneous and particular solutions, $u(x) = C_1 e^{x/3} + C_2 e^{-x/3} + 5x$.\\n5.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:**\\n    *   **BC 1: $u(0) = 0$**\\n        $u(0) = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 + 5(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -C_1$.\\n        So, $u(x) = C_1 (e^{x/3} - e^{-x/3}) + 5x$.\\n    *   **BC 2: $\\frac{du}{dx}|_{x=3} = 0$**\\n        First, find the derivative of $u(x)$: $u'(x) = C_1 (\\frac{1}{3} e^{x/3} - (-\\frac{1}{3}) e^{-x/3}) + 5 = \\frac{C_1}{3} (e^{x/3} + e^{-x/3}) + 5$.\\n        Now apply $u'(3) = 0$: $\\frac{C_1}{3} (e^{3/3} + e^{-3/3}) + 5 = 0 \\implies \\frac{C_1}{3} (e + e^{-1}) + 5 = 0$.\\n        $\\frac{C_1}{3} (\\frac{e^2+1}{e}) = -5 \\implies C_1 (\\frac{e^2+1}{e}) = -15 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{15e}{e^2+1}$.\\n6.  **Final Solution:** Substitute $C_1$ back into the expression for $u(x)$: \\n    $u(x) = -\\frac{15e}{e^2+1} (e^{x/3} - e^{-x/3}) + 5x$. \\n    This can be rewritten as $u(x) = \\frac{15e}{1+e^2} (e^{-x/3} - e^{x/3}) + 5x$, which matches Option A."

The other RAG chunks were less directly applicable to this specific ODE solving technique."
