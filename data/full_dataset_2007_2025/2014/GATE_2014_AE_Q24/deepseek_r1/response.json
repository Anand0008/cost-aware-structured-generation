        "reasoning": "The Dutch roll mode is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode characterized by coupled yawing and rolling motions (Chunk 3). To excite this mode, an input that primarily affects yaw is most effective. The rudder is the primary control surface for yaw (Chunk 5). A step input to the rudder provides a sudden yawing disturbance, which readily excites the Dutch roll oscillation. Elevators (options A and D) control longitudinal (pitch) motion and do not directly couple into lateral-directional modes. While ailerons (option C) can influence Dutch roll due to coupling, a sinusoidal input is not the typical or most direct method for excitation; a step input to the rudder is the standard technique mentioned in flight dynamics literature and practice."
