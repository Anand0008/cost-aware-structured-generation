        "reasoning": "The Dutch roll mode is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode characterized by coupled yawing and rolling motions (Chunk 2, 3). Aircraft control surfaces are designed to primarily affect specific motions: elevators control longitudinal (pitch) motion, ailerons control lateral (roll) motion, and the rudder controls directional (yaw) motion (Chunk 5). Since the Dutch roll mode fundamentally involves yaw, an input that directly generates a yawing moment is the most effective way to excite it. A step input to the rudder directly introduces a yawing moment, thereby exciting the coupled yaw and roll motions characteristic of the Dutch roll mode. Elevators (options A and D) affect longitudinal modes, not lateral-directional. Ailerons (option C) primarily excite the roll mode (Chunk 6), and while roll is part of the Dutch roll, the rudder is the primary control for yaw and thus for directly exciting the Dutch roll mode."

          "Step 3: Evaluate the given options based on the control surface functions and the nature of the Dutch roll mode.",
          "Step 4: Options A and D (elevators) are incorrect because elevators primarily affect longitudinal modes (e.g., Short Period, Phugoid), not lateral-directional modes.",
          "Step 5: Option C (sinusoidal input to the aileron) is less direct. While ailerons control roll (a component of Dutch roll), they primarily excite the pure roll mode (Chunk 6). The coupled yaw motion, which is central to Dutch roll, is not directly initiated by ailerons.",
          "Step 6: Option B (a step input to the rudder) is the most appropriate. The rudder directly controls yaw. By introducing a yawing moment, the rudder directly excites the coupled yaw-roll oscillation that defines the Dutch roll mode. This is also implicitly supported by the use of rudder in yaw dampers to control Dutch roll damping (Chunk 4)."
