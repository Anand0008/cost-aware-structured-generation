    "question_text": "Two overflowing water reservoirs are connected with a 100m long pipe of circular cross-section (of radius, R = 0.02m), such that height difference h remains constant as shown in the figure below. The centerline velocity in the pipe is 10m/s. The velocity profile inside the pipe over the entire length is u = - R^2/(4mu) (dp/dx) [1 - r^2/R^2], where, dp/dx is a constant pressure gradient along the pipe length, x is measured from the left end of the pipe along its central axis and r is radial location inside the pipe with respect to its axis. (Given data: Density and kinematic viscosity of water are 1000kg/m^3 and 1x10^-6 m^2/s respectively; acceleration due to gravity is 10m/s^2). If all other losses except the frictional losses at the pipe wall are neglected, the value of h in meter is ____."
