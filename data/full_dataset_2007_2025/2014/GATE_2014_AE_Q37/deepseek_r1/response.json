        "reasoning": "The problem describes fully developed laminar (Hagen-Poiseuille) flow in a circular pipe connecting two reservoirs with a constant height difference h. The centerline velocity is given as 10 m/s. Using the parabolic velocity profile, the pressure gradient dp/dx is found. For a horizontal pipe, the frictional pressure drop over length L equals the hydrostatic pressure difference ρgh between the reservoirs (neglecting all other losses). Equating these gives h = (4 μ L u_max)/(ρ g R^2). Substituting given values (μ = ρν = 1000 * 1e-6 = 0.001 kg/(m·s), R=0.02 m, L=100 m, u_max=10 m/s, ρ=1000 kg/m³, g=10 m/s²) yields h = 1.0 m, which matches the official answer range (0.99 to 1.01)."

          "Step 3: Express the total frictional pressure drop. For a constant pressure gradient, Δp_friction = |dp/dx| * L = (4 μ L u_max)/R².",
          "Step 4: Apply energy balance between the two reservoirs. Neglecting all losses except pipe wall friction, the available head h equals the frictional head loss h_f. For a horizontal pipe at the same elevation, the pressure difference between the pipe ends is Δp = ρ g h. This pressure difference is entirely balanced by the frictional pressure drop: ρ g h = Δp_friction.",

          "Step 7: Verify using alternative head loss formula for laminar flow: average velocity V_avg = u_max/2 = 5 m/s, h_f = (32 μ L V_avg)/(ρ g D²) with D=0.04 m gives same result (32*0.001*100*5)/(1000*10*0.0016)=16/16=1 m, confirming consistency."

The centerline velocity in the pipe is 10m/s. The velocity profile inside the pipe over the entire length is u = - R^2/(4mu) (dp/dx) [1 - r^2/R^2], where, dp/dx is a constant pressure gradient along the pipe length, x is measured from the left end of the pipe along its central axis and r is radial location inside the pipe with respect to its axis. (Given data: Density and kinematic viscosity of water are 1000kg/m^3 and 1x10^-6 m^2/s respectively; acceleration due to gravity is 10m/s^2). If all other losses except the frictional losses at the pipe wall are neglected, the value of h in meter is ____."
