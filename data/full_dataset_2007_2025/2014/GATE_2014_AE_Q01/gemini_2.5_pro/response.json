        "reasoning": "A real symmetric matrix is always orthogonally diagonalizable, as stated by the Spectral Theorem for Symmetric Matrices (RAG Chunks 2, 3, 5). This means it can always be expressed as $A = P D P^T$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. However, a real symmetric matrix is not necessarily invertible. Invertibility requires that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero, which is equivalent to having no zero eigenvalues (RAG Chunk 1). A symmetric matrix can have zero eigenvalues (e.g., a projection matrix or a matrix like $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$), in which case it is not invertible. Therefore, the matrix is always diagonalizable but not necessarily invertible."

This theorem states that a real $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if it is symmetric. This means that for any real symmetric matrix, there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A = P D P^T$. Thus, a real symmetric matrix is *always* diagonalizable.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze invertibility.** Recall the conditions for matrix invertibility. A square matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero, or equivalently, if it has full rank, or if its nullity is zero, or if all its eigenvalues are non-zero.",
