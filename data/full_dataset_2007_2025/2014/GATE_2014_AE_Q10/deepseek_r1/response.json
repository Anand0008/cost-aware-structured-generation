        "reasoning": "In an unsteady flow, a streakline is defined as the instantaneous line connecting all fluid particles that have previously passed through a common fixed point. Here, bubbles are injected continuously at a fixed point A. At any given instant, the visible line AB connects all bubbles (tracer particles) that originated from A at different injection times. This is the exact definition of a streakline. It is not a streamline (an instantaneous line tangent to velocity vectors everywhere) because the line is formed by actual particles, not by drawing tangents to the velocity field. It is not a pathline because a pathline would trace a single particle over time; here, multiple particles injected at different times are observed at one instant. For unsteady flows, these three lines are distinct. The RAG context clearly defines streaklines and distinguishes them from pathlines and streamlines, especially for unsteady flows."

A streakline is the instantaneous locus of all fluid particles that have passed through a fixed point in space.",
          "Step 3: Apply to the scenario. At any instant, the curved line AB is formed by connecting the positions of all bubbles that were injected at point A at previous times and have been advected by the flow. This matches the definition of a streakline.",
          "Step 4: Check for other possibilities. Since the flow is unsteady, streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines are generally different. The line AB is not a streamline because it is not constructed from the instantaneous velocity field; it is a physical line of markers. It is not a pathline because it does not show the history of a single particle; it shows many particles at one time.",
          "Step 5: Conclude. Therefore, the line AB represents only a streakline."
