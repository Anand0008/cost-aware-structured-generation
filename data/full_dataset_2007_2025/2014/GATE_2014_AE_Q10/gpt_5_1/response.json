        "reasoning": "Bubbles are injected at fixed time intervals from a single fixed point A into an unsteady separated flow. At any given instant, the visible curve AB is the locus of all bubbles that have previously passed through point A and are now at different downstream positions. By definition, a streakline connects all fluid particles that have passed through a particular fixed point in space at earlier times. Therefore AB is a streakline. It is not a pathline, because each individual bubble has its own trajectory (pathline); AB at one instant contains many different particles injected at different times, not the history of a single particle. It is not a streamline either, because in unsteady flow streamlines change with time and require the curve to be everywhere tangent to the instantaneous velocity field; the dye/bubble pattern from continuous injection generally represents a streakline, not necessarily a streamline. Hence the curve AB represents only a streakline."

          "Step 2: Interpret the experiment. Bubbles are injected from the same fixed point A at regular time intervals (every 10 ms). They act as tracer particles and follow the flow.",
          "Step 3: At some later instant, many bubbles that left A at different earlier times occupy different positions downstream, forming a visible curved line AB.",
          "Step 4: Since all these bubbles have passed through the same fixed point A but at different times, the curve joining them at that instant is, by definition, a streakline.",
          "Step 5: It is not a pathline because it does not show the time history of a single bubble; instead it shows many bubbles at one instant. It is not necessarily a streamline because in unsteady separated flow the tracer pattern from continuous injection corresponds to a streakline, which in general differs from the instantaneous streamline pattern.",
          "Step 6: Therefore, the correct choice is that AB is only a streakline."
