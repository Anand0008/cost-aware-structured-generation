        "reasoning": "The diamond airfoil shown is not symmetric about the freestream direction; its chord line is inclined such that the effective angle of attack is positive (nose slightly up relative to the oncoming supersonic flow). In inviscid supersonic flow, each surface segment either compresses the flow via an oblique shock (increasing pressure) or expands it via a Prandtl-Meyer fan (decreasing pressure). Because of the positive angle of attack, the lower surface experiences, on average, higher pressure than the upper surface, generating a net upward force: positive lift. At the same time, the presence of oblique shocks and expansions around the diamond airfoil causes a non-uniform pressure distribution with higher pressure on forward-facing surfaces and lower pressure on aft-facing surfaces. The streamwise components of these pressure forces do not cancel and produce a net rearward force: positive drag (wave drag). For inviscid flow, there is no skin-friction drag, but wave drag remains non-zero. Therefore, the correct qualitative statement is that the airfoil experiences both positive lift and positive drag, which corresponds to option D. Options A, B, and C are inconsistent with the known behavior of a diamond airfoil at non-zero angle of attack in supersonic flow: zero drag is impossible in the presence of shocks, and zero or negative lift contradicts the positive effective angle of attack shown."

          "Step 2: Recall supersonic thin-airfoil/shock-expansion theory. Flow turning into the body (compression) generates oblique shocks and higher pressure; flow turning away from the body (expansion) generates Prandtl-Meyer fans and lower pressure.",
          "Step 3: For a symmetric diamond at zero angle of attack, pressures on upper and lower surfaces are symmetric, giving zero lift but non-zero wave drag due to higher pressure on the front faces than on the rear faces.",
          "Step 4: With positive angle of attack, the lower surface is more compressive (stronger shocks, higher pressures) and the upper surface more expansive (stronger expansions, lower pressures). This pressure imbalance produces a net upward force: positive lift.",
          "Step 5: Regardless of angle of attack, the presence of shocks and expansions around the diamond airfoil leads to higher pressure on forward-facing surfaces and lower pressure on aft-facing surfaces, giving a net rearward component of force: positive drag (wave drag).",
