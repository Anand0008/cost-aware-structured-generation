The leading edge oblique shocks create regions of higher pressure on the forward surfaces, while the mid-chord expansion fans create regions of lower pressure on the aft surfaces. This pressure difference results in a net positive lift force. Additionally, the irreversible nature of the shocks leads to wave drag, even at zero angle of attack. Therefore, the correct statement is option D: 'The airfoil will experience positive lift and positive drag force'."
