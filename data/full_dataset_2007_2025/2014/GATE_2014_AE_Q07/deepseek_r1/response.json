        "reasoning": "The official GATE answer key states D. This is consistent with the physics of a diamond airfoil at a non-zero angle of attack in supersonic flow. The retrieved knowledge (RAG) primarily discusses the symmetric, zero-angle-of-attack case (zero lift, positive drag). The image description includes angles (10°, 5°, 5°), which likely indicate an asymmetric configuration or a non-zero angle of attack. For an inviscid supersonic flow, any body (even symmetric) experiences wave drag due to shocks and expansions. If the airfoil is oriented such that the flow is not symmetric (e.g., positive angle of attack), the pressure on the bottom (windward) surfaces becomes higher than on the top (leeward) surfaces, generating positive lift. Therefore, both lift and drag are positive. If the airfoil were symmetric and at zero angle of attack, the answer would be A. The image must show a configuration that breaks symmetry, leading to option D."

          "Step 1: Understand the setup. The diagram shows a diamond-shaped airfoil in a supersonic freestream (M > 1). The angles (10°, 5°, 5°) likely represent shock angles or surface angles. The freestream flow is horizontal.",
          "Step 2: Recall the key principle for supersonic flow over sharp-edged bodies. Flow deflection compresses via oblique shocks if it turns into itself, and expands via Prandtl-Meyer fans if it turns away.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the pressure distribution. For a diamond airfoil, the front faces (facing into the flow) experience higher pressure due to compression shocks. The rear faces (facing away from the flow) experience lower pressure due to expansion fans.",
          "Step 4: Determine lift and drag. Lift is the net force perpendicular to the freestream, and drag is parallel. For a symmetric airfoil at zero angle of attack, the pressure distribution is symmetric vertically, resulting in zero lift. However, the front faces have higher pressure than the rear faces, creating a net force in the flow direction (wave drag).",
          "Step 5: Incorporate asymmetry from the image. The provided angles (10°, 5°, 5°) suggest the airfoil is not at zero angle of attack or is asymmetric. This breaks the vertical symmetry of the pressure distribution. The bottom surfaces will generally experience stronger compression (higher pressure) than the top surfaces, leading to a net upward force (positive lift). Wave drag remains positive due to the pressure difference between front and rear faces on both surfaces.",
          "Step 6: Conclude. Since the flow is inviscid, the only drag component is pressure (wave) drag, which is always present for supersonic bodies. With asymmetry, lift is non-zero. Given typical GATE problems and the answer key, the airfoil experiences both positive lift and positive drag."
