For longitudinal static stability, the condition is that the pitching moment coefficient (C_M,cg) must decrease as the angle of attack (alpha_a) increases, i.e., dC_M,cg / d alpha_a < 0 (Chunk 4).\n2. The pitching moment coefficient at zero lift (C_M,cg at zero lift) must be positive to ensure the aircraft can be trimmed at a desired angle of attack (Chunk 5).\n\nTherefore, the combination of P and Q is the necessary criterion for stick-fixed longitudinal balance and static stability, as stated in the correct answer C."
