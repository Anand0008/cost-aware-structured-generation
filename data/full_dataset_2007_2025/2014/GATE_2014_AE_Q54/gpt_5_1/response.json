        "reasoning": "Stick-fixed longitudinal balance (trim) requires that at some lift (hence some angle of attack) the net pitching moment about CG is zero. For a conventional tail-aft airplane, to be able to trim at a positive lift coefficient, the pitching moment coefficient at zero lift about CG, $C_{M,cg}(L=0)$, must be positive so that as lift (and $\\alpha$) increases, the moment can cross zero. Longitudinal static stability requires that an increase in angle of attack produces a restoring nose-down moment, i.e. $\\partial C_{M,cg}/\\partial \\alpha_a < 0$. This is exactly statement Q. From Anderson and Nelson (and the RAG chunks), the static stability condition is $C_{M_\\alpha} < 0$ or equivalently $dC_M/d\\alpha < 0$. For balance, Anderson (Ch. 7) shows that a conventional wing alone has negative $C_{M,0}$, so the tail is set to make the overall $C_{M,0}$ positive, enabling trim at positive $\\alpha$. Hence P (positive $C_M$ at zero lift) and Q (negative slope) together are the necessary criteria. Statement R (negative $C_M$ at zero lift) is opposite to what is needed for a conventional tail-aft configuration to trim at positive lift. Statement S (negative slope of $C_L$ vs $\\alpha$) is incorrect because for normal wings $dC_L/d\\alpha$ is positive; a negative slope would mean lift decreases with angle of attack, which is not the usual operating regime. Therefore only P and Q are correct, matching option C."

          "For a conventional tail-aft airplane, to trim at positive lift, the overall $C_{M,cg}$ at zero lift must be positive so that as $\\alpha$ (and $C_L$) increase, the line $C_M = C_{M,0} + C_{M_\\alpha}\\,\\alpha$ crosses zero at a positive $\\alpha$ (statement P).",
          "Check statement R: a negative $C_{M,cg}$ at zero lift would make the trim angle negative if $C_{M_\\alpha}<0$, which is not acceptable for normal positive-lift flight.",
          "Check statement S: the slope of $C_L$ vs $\\alpha_a$ for a normal wing is positive (lift increases with angle of attack), so it must not be negative; S is incorrect.",
