The beam is massless, so it behaves as an equivalent linear spring at its tip with stiffness k_b = 3EI/L^3. Using k_b = 3×(210×10^9×8.33×10^-10)/(0.6^3) ≈ 2430 N/m. For two springs in series, the equivalent stiffness is k_eq = (k_s k_b)/(k_s + k_b) ≈ (500×2430)/(500+2430) ≈ 410 N/m. The natural frequency of a single-degree-of-freedom system is ω_n = \\sqrt{k_eq/m} = \\sqrt{410/1} ≈ 20.25 rad/s, which matches option B (20.36 rad/s) within rounding."
