First, the principal stresses (hoop and longitudinal stresses) are calculated. Then, these are used to determine the von Mises equivalent stress. Finally, the FOS is found by dividing the material's failure stress by the calculated von Mises stress.\n\n1.  **Calculate Hoop Stress (Circumferential Stress), $\\sigma_h$:**\n    $\\sigma_h = \\frac{PD}{2t}$\n    Given: $P = 5 \\text{ bar} = 0.5 \\text{ MPa}$, $D = 30 \\text{ cm} = 300 \\text{ mm}$, $t = 1 \\text{ mm}$\n    $\\sigma_h = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ MPa} \\times 300 \\text{ mm}}{2 \\times 1 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{150}{2} = 75 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n2.  **Calculate Longitudinal Stress (Axial Stress), $\\sigma_L$:**\n    $\\sigma_L = \\frac{PD}{4t}$\n    $\\sigma_L = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ MPa} \\times 300 \\text{ mm}}{4 \\times 1 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{150}{4} = 37.5 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n3.  **Identify Principal Stresses:**\n    For a thin-walled cylinder under internal pressure, the hoop stress and longitudinal stress are the two primary principal stresses. The radial stress is negligible (approximately zero) for thin walls.\n    So, $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_h = 75 \\text{ MPa}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_L = 37.5 \\text{ MPa}$. The third principal stress $\\sigma_3 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Von Mises Equivalent Stress, $\\sigma_v$:**\n    For a plane stress state ($\\sigma_3 = 0$), the von Mises criterion is given by:\n    $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}$\n    $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{(75 \\text{ MPa})^2 + (37.5 \\text{ MPa})^2 - (75 \\text{ MPa} \\times 37.5 \\text{ MPa})}$\n    $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{5625 + 1406.25 - 2812.5}$\n    $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{4218.75} \\approx 64.95 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n5.  **Calculate Factor of Safety (FOS):**\n    $\\text{FOS} = \\frac{\\text{Failure Stress}}{\\text{Von Mises Stress}}$\n    Given: Failure stress $= 260 \\text{ MPa}$\n    $\\text{FOS} = \\frac{260 \\text{ MPa}}{64.95 \\text{ MPa}} \\approx 4.003$\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the FOS is 4.0, which matches option D."
