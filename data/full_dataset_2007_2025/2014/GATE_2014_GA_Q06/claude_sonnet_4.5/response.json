An inversion is a pair of elements in the permutation where a larger element appears before a smaller element.\n\nFor the given strings:\nALRVX: This is an even permutation, as it has 4 inversions (A-V, A-X, L-R, L-X).\nEPVZB: This is an even permutation, as it has 4 inversions (E-V, E-B, P-Z, P-B).\nITZDF: This is an even permutation, as it has 4 inversions (I-D, I-F, T-D, T-F).\nOYEIK: This is an odd permutation, as it has 5 inversions (O-I, O-K, Y-I, Y-K, E-K).\n\nTherefore, the odd one out in the given group is OYEIK, which is the only odd permutation."
