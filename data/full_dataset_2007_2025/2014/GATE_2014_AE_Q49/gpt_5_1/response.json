For an isentropic inlet/diffuser, the stagnation (reservoir) conditions at the diffuser entrance are obtained from the free-stream Mach number and ambient static conditions. The diffuser throat is the minimum area, so for maximum mass flow in an isentropic converging-diverging passage the throat is choked: M = 1. Using isentropic relations, we compute stagnation pressure and temperature from free-stream conditions, then compute critical (throat) static pressure and temperature at M = 1. With these, we obtain density at the throat and then mass flow rate \\(\\dot{m} = \\rho_t A_t a_t M_t\\). Numerically this gives about 157 kg/s, matching option D and confirming the key."
