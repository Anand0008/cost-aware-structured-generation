'Elusive' means difficult to catch or find, which aptly describes the thief. In option A, 'eludes' is incorrectly used where 'alludes' (to refer indirectly) is intended. In option C, 'allusive' (making indirect references) is incorrectly used where 'elusive' (hard to grasp) is intended. In option D, 'allusive' is incorrectly used to describe mirages; 'illusory' (based on illusion) is correct, but the sentence states mirages 'can be allusive,' which is wrong."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the core vocabulary. 'Elude' (verb) means to escape or avoid. 'Elusive' (adjective) describes something hard to catch or pin down. 'Allude' (verb) means to refer to something indirectly. 'Allusive' (adjective) describes something that contains such indirect references. 'Illusory' (adjective) means based on illusion, deceptive.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Option A: 'When the teacher eludes to different authors...' The teacher is likely referring to authors, which requires 'alludes.' The word 'eludes' (escapes) is incorrect here. The second part, 'he is being elusive,' means he is hard to pin down, which might contextually fit a teacher who is vague, but the primary error is 'eludes.' Therefore, the underlined word is used incorrectly.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Option B: 'When the thief keeps eluding the police...' 'Eluding' correctly means avoiding capture. 'He is being elusive' correctly describes the thief as hard to catch. Both underlined words are used correctly.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option C: 'Matters that are difficult to understand, identify or remember are allusive.' The intended meaning is that such matters are hard to grasp, which is the definition of 'elusive,' not 'allusive.' 'Allusive' refers to indirect references, not difficulty. Therefore, the underlined word is incorrect.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option D: 'Mirages can be allusive...' Mirages are optical illusions, so they are deceptive or 'illusory.' They are not inherently 'allusive' (making indirect references). The second part correctly suggests 'illusory' is better, but the sentence claims they 'can be allusive,' which is an incorrect usage. Therefore, the underlined word is used incorrectly.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that only Option B uses the underlined word(s) correctly in the given context."
