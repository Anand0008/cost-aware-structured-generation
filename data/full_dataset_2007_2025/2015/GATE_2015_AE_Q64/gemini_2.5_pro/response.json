This loss is the difference between the actual work input to the compressor and the ideal (isentropic) work input required to achieve the same pressure ratio. Both actual and isentropic work can be calculated using the specific heat at constant pressure ($C_p$) and the respective temperature differences. First, the isentropic exit stagnation temperature ($T_{03,is}$) is calculated using the given inlet stagnation temperature ($T_{01}$) and the overall stagnation pressure ratio ($P_{03}/P_{01}$). Then, the actual specific work ($W_{C,actual}$) is found using the actual exit stagnation temperature ($T_{03}$) and $T_{01}$. Finally, the isentropic specific work ($W_{C,is}$) is calculated using $T_{03,is}$ and $T_{01}$. The difference $W_{C,actual} - W_{C,is}$ gives the energy loss. The calculated value of 21.13 kJ/kg falls within the specified range of 20.5 to 21.3 kJ/kg."

Chunk 3 also provided a formula for actual compressor work, reinforcing the concepts. The RAG context directly supported the core calculations and conceptual understanding required for the problem."
