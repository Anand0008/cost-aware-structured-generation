    "question_text": "The thin rectangular tube shown below is made of a material with shear modulus, G = 80 GPa. The shear flow is calculated based on the mid-thickness dimensions. If the free end is allowed to twist no more than 0.0727 rad, then the maximum torque (in Nm) which the tube can be subjected to at its free end is ______."
