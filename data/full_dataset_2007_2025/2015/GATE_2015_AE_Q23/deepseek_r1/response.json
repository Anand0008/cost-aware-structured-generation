        "notes": "RAG provided excellent definitions and formulas for total impulse and effective exhaust velocity from Sutton's Rocket Propulsion Elements (Chunks 1, 2, 3). Specifically, Chunk 2 gave the direct relationship I = m_p * V_j, which is exactly the formula needed. The context was highly relevant and sufficient to solve the problem without external knowledge."
