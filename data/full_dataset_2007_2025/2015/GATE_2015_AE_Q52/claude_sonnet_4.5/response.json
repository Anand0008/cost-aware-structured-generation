This is because having equal eigenvalues does not guarantee that the corresponding eigenvectors will be linearly independent. A matrix with repeated eigenvalues can still be diagonalizable, but only if the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue equals its algebraic multiplicity. If the geometric multiplicity is less than the algebraic multiplicity, then the eigenvectors will not be linearly independent, and the matrix will not be diagonalizable. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
