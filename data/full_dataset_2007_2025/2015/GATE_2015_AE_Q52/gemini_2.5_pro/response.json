        "reasoning": "A square matrix of size `n x n` is diagonalizable if and only if it possesses `n` linearly independent eigenvectors. This condition is equivalent to stating that for every eigenvalue `$\\lambda_i$`, its geometric multiplicity (GM) must be equal to its algebraic multiplicity (AM). The question states that all eigenvalues of the matrix are real and equal. Let this common eigenvalue be `$\\lambda$`. For an `n x n` matrix, this means the algebraic multiplicity (AM) of `$\\lambda$` is `n`. For the matrix to be diagonalizable, its geometric multiplicity must also be `n`. However, it is always true that `GM($\\lambda$) \\le AM($\\lambda$)`. If `GM($\\lambda$) < AM($\\lambda$)`, then the matrix does not have `n` linearly independent eigenvectors and is therefore not diagonalizable. A classic counterexample is a non-diagonal Jordan block matrix, such as `A = [[$\\lambda$, 1], [0, $\\lambda$]]`. For this 2x2 matrix, both eigenvalues are `$\\lambda$` (repeated, so AM=2). However, solving `(A - $\\lambda$I)v = 0` yields `[[0, 1], [0, 0]] * [[v1], [v2]] = [[0], [0]]`, which implies `v2 = 0`. The eigenvectors are of the form `[v1, 0]`, meaning there is only one linearly independent eigenvector (e.g., `[1, 0]`). Thus, GM=1, which is less than AM=2. In this case, the matrix is not diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are not linearly independent (it only has one independent eigenvector, not two). Therefore, if all eigenvalues are real and equal, the eigenvectors are *not necessarily* linearly independent, making option B correct. Options A and C are incorrect because diagonalizability and linear independence of eigenvectors are not guaranteed. Option D is incorrect because the determinant is the product of eigenvalues. If `$\\lambda \\neq 0$`, then `det(A) = $\\lambda^n \\neq 0$."

          "Step 2: Analyze the given condition: 'all the eigenvalues of a matrix are real and equal'. Let the common eigenvalue be `$\\lambda$`. For an `n x n` matrix, this means the algebraic multiplicity (AM) of `$\\lambda$` is `n`.",
          "Step 3: Relate this to geometric multiplicity. The geometric multiplicity (GM) of an eigenvalue `$\\lambda$` is the dimension of its eigenspace, representing the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with `$\\lambda$`. We know that `GM($\\lambda$) \\le AM($\\lambda$)` always holds.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate diagonalizability. For the matrix to be diagonalizable, we need `GM($\\lambda$) = AM($\\lambda$) = n`. However, the condition 'all eigenvalues are real and equal' does not guarantee that `GM($\\lambda$) = n`. It is possible that `GM($\\lambda$) < n`.",
          "Step 5: Consider a counterexample. A common counterexample is a Jordan block matrix, such as `A = [[$\\lambda$, 1], [0, $\\lambda$]]`. For this 2x2 matrix, both eigenvalues are `$\\lambda$` (so AM=2). However, it only has one linearly independent eigenvector (e.g., `[1, 0]$`), so GM=1. Since `GM < AM`, this matrix is not diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are not linearly independent.",
          "Step 6: Conclude based on the options. Option B, 'its eigenvectors are not necessarily linearly independent', is correct because the counterexample shows a case where they are not linearly independent. Options A and C are incorrect as diagonalizability and linear independence are not guaranteed. Option D is incorrect because the determinant is the product of eigenvalues, `$\\lambda^n$`, which is not necessarily zero if `$\\lambda \\neq 0$`."
