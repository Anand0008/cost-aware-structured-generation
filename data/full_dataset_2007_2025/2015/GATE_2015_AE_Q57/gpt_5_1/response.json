        "reasoning": "Work done on the rotor is given as 734 kJ per kg of air (since no mass basis is specified and a separate mass flow is also given, this is standard GATE convention for specific work). The actual stagnation temperature rise across the stage is \\(\\Delta T_{0a} = W/c_p = 734/1.005 \\approx 730\\,\\text{K}\\), which is clearly unphysical for a single stage. Therefore, the only consistent interpretation is that 734 kJ is the total power to the rotor, not per kg. Using shaft power \\(P = 734\\,\\text{kW}\\) and mass flow \\(\\dot m = 24\\,\\text{kg/s}\\), the specific work is \\(w = P/\\dot m = 734/24 \\approx 30.6\\,\\text{kJ/kg}\\). Then \\(\\Delta T_{0a} = w/c_p = 30.6/1.005 \\approx 30.4\\,\\text{K}\\). With isentropic efficiency \\(\\eta_s = 0.86\\), the isentropic stagnation temperature rise is \\(\\Delta T_{0s} = \\eta_s \\Delta T_{0a} \\approx 26.1\\,\\text{K}\\). Inlet static temperature is 278 K and inlet velocity is 140 m/s with zero whirl, so inlet stagnation temperature is \\(T_{01} = 278 + V^2/(2c_p) \\approx 278 + 9.7 \\approx 287.7\\,\\text{K}\\). Thus \\(T_{02s} = T_{01} + \\Delta T_{0s} \\approx 313.8\\,\\text{K}\\). For air with \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\), \\(T_{02s}/T_{01} = (p_{02}/p_{01})^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}\\). Hence \\(p_{02}/p_{01} = (T_{02s}/T_{01})^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)} = (313.8/287.7)^{3.5} \\approx 1.36\\). This lies within the official answer range 1.33–1.40."
