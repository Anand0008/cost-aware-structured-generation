This formula is derived from the fundamental relationship for density variation in an isothermal layer of the standard atmosphere, which states that density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude. The exponent contains the terms g₀ (acceleration due to gravity at sea level), R (specific gas constant for air), and T (temperature), which are all constant within the isothermal layer. The altitude difference (h - h₁) appears in the exponent, indicating the exponential decay of density with increasing height above the base of the layer."
