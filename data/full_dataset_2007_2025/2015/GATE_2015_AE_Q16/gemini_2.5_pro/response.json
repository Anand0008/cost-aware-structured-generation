In the standard atmosphere model, an isothermal layer is characterized by a constant temperature (T). The density variation in such a layer is derived from the hydrostatic equation ($dp = -\\rho g_0 dh$) and the ideal gas law ($p = \\rho RT$). For an isothermal layer, integrating these equations yields an exponential relationship for density with altitude. The specific formula is given by:\n$$\\rho = \\rho_1 e^{{-\\frac{{g_0(h - h_1)}}{{RT}}}}$$ \nTo match the options provided, we can rearrange this equation by dividing both sides by $\\rho_1$:\n$$\\frac{{\\rho}}{{\\rho_1}} = e^{{-\\frac{{g_0(h - h_1)}}{{RT}}}}$$ \nThis expression directly matches Option A. The negative sign in the exponent correctly indicates that density decreases as altitude $h$ increases above the base altitude $h_1$."
