The streamline passing through the stagnation point, which defines the body surface, has a stream function value of Λ/2. \n\nAt a distance far downstream, where the flow has asymptotically approached the freestream, the streamline corresponding to 90% of the freestream velocity has a stream function value of 0.9(Λ/2). Using the equation for the stagnation streamline, this location is found to be at a distance of approximately 8.9 to 9.1 times the distance s of the source from the stagnation point. Therefore, the ratio d/s is in the range of 8.9 to 9.1."
