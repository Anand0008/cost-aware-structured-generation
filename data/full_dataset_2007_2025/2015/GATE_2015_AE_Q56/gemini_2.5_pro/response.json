The velocity field for this combination is derived by adding the velocities from the uniform flow and the source. The stagnation point location 's' is determined by setting the total velocity to zero. Subsequently, the velocity at point 'P' (upstream of the stagnation point) is set to 90% of the freestream velocity, and its location 'd' relative to the stagnation point is found. All calculations consistently lead to the ratio d/s = 9.0, which falls within the specified correct answer range of 8.9 to 9.1."

          "Step 1: Identify the flow field components. The flow is a superposition of a uniform flow with velocity $U_{\\infty}$ in the positive x-direction and a 2D line source of strength $\\Lambda$ located at the origin.",
          "Step 2: Write down the velocity components for the combined flow. The velocity components in Cartesian coordinates are given by $u = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi} \\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$ and $v = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi} \\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}$.",
          "Step 3: Locate the stagnation point. The stagnation point occurs on the x-axis (where $y=0$) where the total velocity $u$ is zero. Setting $u=0$ and $y=0$ in the x-component of velocity, we get $0 = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi x_{stag}}$. Solving for $x_{stag}$ gives $x_{stag} = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U_{\\infty}}$.",
          "Step 4: Relate the stagnation point location to 's'. The problem defines 's' as the distance of the line source (located at $x=0$) from the front stagnation point ($x_{stag}$). Therefore, $s = |x_{stag}| = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U_{\\infty}}$.",
          "Step 5: Determine the velocity at point P. Point P is located upstream of the stagnation point on the x-axis. Let its coordinate be $x_P$. The problem states that 'd' is the upstream distance from the stagnation point to P. Thus, $x_P = x_{stag} - d = -s - d$. At point P, the velocity $u_P$ is 90% of the undisturbed velocity, i.e., $u_P = 0.9 U_{\\infty}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute $x_P$ into the velocity equation. Using the x-component of velocity on the x-axis ($y=0$), we have $u_P = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi x_P}$. Substitute $u_P = 0.9 U_{\\infty}$ and $x_P = -(s+d)$: $0.9 U_{\\infty} = U_{\\infty} - \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi (s+d)}$.",
          "Step 7: Solve for 'd' in terms of 's'. Rearranging the equation from Step 6: $0.1 U_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi (s+d)} \\implies s+d = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi (0.1 U_{\\infty})}$. From Step 4, we know $s = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U_{\\infty}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $s+d$: $s+d = \\frac{1}{0.1} \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U_{\\infty}} \\right) = 10s$.",
          "Step 8: Calculate the ratio d/s. From $s+d = 10s$, we can solve for $d$: $d = 10s - s = 9s$. Therefore, the ratio $d/s = 9$."

The flow is irrotational and can be modeled as a linear combination of a uniform flow and a line source (Rankine half body) as shown below. Let s be the distance of the line source from the front stagnation point. Let d be the upstream distance from the stagnation point to the streamwise location (labeled below as P) where the oncoming stream reaches 90% of its undisturbed velocity. Then d/s = ______."
