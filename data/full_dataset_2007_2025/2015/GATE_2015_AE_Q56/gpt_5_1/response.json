        "reasoning": "The flow is modeled as a superposition of a uniform stream of speed U_\\infty and a 2-D line source of strength m located a distance s downstream of the front stagnation point. On the x-axis upstream of the stagnation point, the local velocity is the sum of the uniform flow and the induced velocity of the source. For a 2-D source at the origin, the radial velocity is v_r = m/(2\\pi r). Along the negative x-axis (upstream), the radial direction is opposite to the positive x-direction, so the x-velocity is u = U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi r). The stagnation point occurs where u = 0, giving r_{stag} = m/(2\\pi U_\\infty). The source is at x = 0, so the stagnation point is at x = -s with s = r_{stag} = m/(2\\pi U_\\infty). A point P is located further upstream at distance d from the stagnation point, so its coordinate relative to the source is r_P = s + d. The x-velocity at P is u_P = U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi (s + d)). Using m/(2\\pi) = U_\\infty s from the stagnation condition, we get u_P = U_\\infty - U_\\infty s/(s + d) = U_\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{s + d}\\right) = U_\\infty \\frac{d}{s + d}. The problem states that at P the oncoming stream reaches 90% of its undisturbed velocity, so u_P = 0.9 U_\\infty. Hence 0.9 = d/(s + d). Solving gives 0.9(s + d) = d \\Rightarrow 0.9s + 0.9d = d \\Rightarrow 0.9s = 0.1d \\Rightarrow d/s = 9. This matches the official answer range 8.9 to 9.1."

The flow is irrotational and can be modeled as a linear combination of a uniform flow and a line source (Rankine half body) as shown below. Let s be the distance of the line source from the front stagnation point. Let d be the upstream distance from the stagnation point to the streamwise location (labeled below as P) where the oncoming stream reaches 90% of its undisturbed velocity. Then d/s = ______."
