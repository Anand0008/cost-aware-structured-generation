        "reasoning": "The turbofan engine has the highest propulsive efficiency among the options provided. This is because the turbofan engine uses a large fan to bypass a significant portion of air around the core engine, generating thrust from both the fan and the exhaust jet. The high bypass ratio of modern turbofan engines results in higher propulsive efficiency compared to turbojet engines, which rely solely on the high-velocity exhaust jet for thrust. Ramjet engines, while having high thrust-to-weight ratios, generally have lower propulsive efficiency due to the relatively lower pressure at which heat is added in the combustion process."
