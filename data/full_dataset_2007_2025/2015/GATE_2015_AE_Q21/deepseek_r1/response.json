Turbofan engines accelerate a large mass of air by a small amount, resulting in lower jet velocity compared to turbojets or ramjets, thus higher η_p at subsonic speeds. Turbojets (with or without afterburner) have higher jet velocities, reducing η_p. Ramjets also have high jet velocities and lower efficiency at typical speeds. Retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 3, 5) confirms that turbofans offer better propulsive efficiency due to bypass air."

Afterburning increases jet velocity further, reducing η_p. Ramjets also operate with high jet velocities. Turbofans use a bypass stream to accelerate a larger mass of air at lower velocity, resulting in higher α and thus higher η_p.",
