        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. Turbofan engines are designed to achieve higher propulsive efficiency compared to turbojets and ramjets. Propulsive efficiency is maximized when the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) is close to the flight velocity ($V_{\\infty}$). Turbojet engines, especially with afterburners, produce a very high exhaust velocity by accelerating a relatively small mass of air to a very high speed. This results in significant kinetic energy losses in the exhaust, leading to lower propulsive efficiency. Ramjet engines also operate by ejecting gases at extremely high velocities, making their propulsive efficiency significant only at very high flight speeds, but generally lower than turbofans in their optimal operating regimes. Turbofan engines, particularly high bypass ratio ones, accelerate a larger mass of air (the bypass air) to a lower exhaust velocity, making the effective average exhaust velocity closer to the flight velocity. This reduces the kinetic energy wasted in the exhaust, thereby increasing propulsive efficiency. This is explicitly stated in Chunk 3: 'Turbofans: Represent a compromise. They use a large fan to bypass some air around the core engine. A high bypass ratio... increases propulsive efficiency.'"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the concept of propulsive efficiency. Propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) measures how effectively the kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust jet is converted into useful thrust power. It is generally higher when the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) is closer to the flight velocity ($V_{\\infty}$), minimizing kinetic energy losses in the exhaust.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Turbojet engines. Turbojets generate thrust by accelerating a relatively small mass of air to a very high exhaust velocity. This large difference between $V_e$ and $V_{\\infty}$ (especially at lower flight speeds) leads to significant kinetic energy losses and thus lower propulsive efficiency (as noted in Chunk 3 and 5).",
          "Step 3: Analyze Afterburning Turbojet engines. An afterburner further increases the exhaust velocity by burning additional fuel downstream of the turbine. While this provides significant thrust augmentation, it drastically increases the exhaust velocity, moving it even further from the flight velocity, thereby reducing propulsive efficiency even more than a non-afterburning turbojet (Chunk 4 indicates higher SFC for afterburning turbojets and ramjets, implying lower efficiency).",
          "Step 4: Analyze Ramjet engines. Ramjets operate at very high supersonic speeds and produce extremely high exhaust velocities. While efficient at their design speeds, their exhaust velocity is still typically much higher than the flight velocity, leading to lower propulsive efficiency compared to turbofans (Chunk 2 and 3). They also have high SFC (Chunk 4).",
          "Step 5: Analyze Turbofan engines. Turbofans use a large fan to accelerate a significant portion of air (bypass air) around the core engine. This bypass air is accelerated to a relatively lower velocity compared to the core jet. By moving a larger mass of air at a lower effective exhaust velocity, the turbofan brings its effective exhaust velocity closer to the flight velocity, significantly reducing kinetic energy losses in the exhaust and thus achieving higher propulsive efficiency, especially for subsonic flight (Chunk 1 and 3).",
          "Step 6: Compare the options. Based on the analysis, turbofan engines, particularly high bypass ratio ones, are designed for higher propulsive efficiency by minimizing exhaust kinetic energy losses, making them the most efficient among the given options."
