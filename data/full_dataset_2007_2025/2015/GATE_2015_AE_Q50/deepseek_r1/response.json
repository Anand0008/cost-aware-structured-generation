    "question_text": "A solid rocket motor is designed with a cylindrical end-burning propellant grain of length 1 m and diameter 32 cm. The density of the propellant grain is 1750 kg/m^3. The specific impulse of the motor is 190 s and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. If the propellant burns for a period of 150 s, then the thrust (in N) produced by the rocket motor is ______."
