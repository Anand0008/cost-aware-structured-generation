Using the integrating factor method, the integrating factor (IF) is `e^(∫2 dx) = e^(2x)`. Multiplying the ODE by the IF gives `d/dx (y * e^(2x)) = e^(2x)`. Integrating both sides yields `y * e^(2x) = (1/2)e^(2x) + C`, where C is the constant of integration. Solving for `y(x)`, we get `y(x) = 1/2 + C*e^(-2x)`. To find the asymptotic behavior as `x -> ∞`, we take the limit: `lim (x->∞) y(x) = lim (x->∞) [1/2 + C*e^(-2x)]`. Since `e^(-2x)` approaches 0 as `x -> ∞`, the limit is `1/2`. The value `0.5` falls within the specified range of `0.49` to `0.51`."
