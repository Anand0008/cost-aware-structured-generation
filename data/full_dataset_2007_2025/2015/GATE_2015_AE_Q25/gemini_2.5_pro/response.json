This is given by the static equilibrium equation: $m \\cdot g = k \\cdot \\delta_{static}$. Given mass $m = 0.5 \\text{ kg}$ and stiffness $k = 5 \\text{ N/mm}$, we first convert the stiffness to consistent units, e.g., $k = 5 \\text{ N/mm} = 5 \\times 1000 \\text{ N/m} = 5000 \\text{ N/m}$. Using $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$, the static displacement is $\\delta_{static} = \\frac{m \\cdot g}{k} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ kg} \\cdot 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}{5000 \\text{ N/m}} = \\frac{4.905 \\text{ N}}{5000 \\text{ N/m}} = 0.000981 \\text{ m}$. Converting this to millimeters, $\\delta_{static} = 0.000981 \\text{ m} \\times 1000 \\text{ mm/m} = 0.981 \\text{ mm}$.

          "Step 2: Understand the physical principle: When a mass is suspended vertically by a spring and is at rest, it is in static equilibrium. This means the downward gravitational force is balanced by the upward spring force.",

          "Step 4: Ensure all units are consistent. The mass is in kg, and gravity is in m/s$^2$, so the force will be in Newtons (N). The stiffness is given in N/mm. To get displacement in meters, convert stiffness to N/m: $k = 5 \\text{ N/mm} = 5 \\times 1000 \\text{ N/m} = 5000 \\text{ N/m}$.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for the static displacement: $\\delta_{static} = \\frac{m \\cdot g}{k}$.",
