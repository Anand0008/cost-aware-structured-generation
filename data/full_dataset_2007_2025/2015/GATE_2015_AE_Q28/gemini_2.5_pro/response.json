          "Step 1: Identify the governing relationship for lift-off distance. From aircraft performance principles, the lift-off distance ($s_{LO}$) is proportional to the square of the aircraft's weight ($W$). This is given by the simplified formula $s_{LO} = \\frac{{1.44W^2}}{{g \\rho S C_{{L,max}} T}}$ (Chunk 1), which implies $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$.",
          "Step 2: Define the initial and final conditions. Let the initial weight be $W_1$ and the initial lift-off distance be $s_{LO1}$. The problem states a 20% increase in aircraft weight, so the new weight $W_2 = W_1 + 0.20 W_1 = 1.20 W_1$. Let the new lift-off distance be $s_{LO2}$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the proportionality to relate the initial and final lift-off distances. Since $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$, we can write $\\frac{s_{LO2}}{s_{LO1}} = \\left(\\frac{W_2}{W_1}\\right)^2$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the new weight in terms of the initial weight. $\\frac{s_{LO2}}{s_{LO1}} = \\left(\\frac{1.20 W_1}{W_1}\\right)^2 = (1.20)^2 = 1.44$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the new lift-off distance in terms of the initial lift-off distance. From Step 4, $s_{LO2} = 1.44 s_{LO1}$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the percentage change in lift-off distance. Percentage change $= \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100\\%$. So, Percentage change $= \\frac{s_{LO2} - s_{LO1}}{s_{LO1}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1.44 s_{LO1} - s_{LO1}}{s_{LO1}} \\times 100\\%$.",
          "Step 7: Simplify the expression to find the final percentage change. Percentage change $= \\frac{(1.44 - 1) s_{LO1}}{s_{LO1}} \\times 100\\% = 0.44 \\times 100\\% = 44\\%."
