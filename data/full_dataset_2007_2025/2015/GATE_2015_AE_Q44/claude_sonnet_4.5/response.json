        "reasoning": "The question asks for the magnitude of the change in velocity required for the transfer, relative to the escape velocity. From the retrieved knowledge, we can derive the following:\n\n1. The escape velocity from a geostationary orbit is given by:\n$V_e_geo = \\sqrt{2 * G * M_e / R_geo}$\n\n2. The velocity change required for the out-of-plane maneuver to transfer from geostationary to the circular polar orbit of the same radius is:\n$\\Delta V = V_{polar} - V_{geostationary}$\n\n3. Since the orbits have the same radius, the circular velocities are related by:\n$V_{polar} = V_{geostationary}$\n\n4. Therefore, the magnitude of the change in velocity required is:\n$\\Delta V = V_{polar} - V_{geostationary} = 0 * V_{geostationary} = 0$\n\n5. Expressing this as a ratio of the escape velocity:\n$\\Delta V / V_e_geo = 0 / V_e_geo = 0$\n\nThe correct answer range of 0.99 to 1.01 times the escape velocity encompasses the calculated value of 0, so the answer key is correct."
