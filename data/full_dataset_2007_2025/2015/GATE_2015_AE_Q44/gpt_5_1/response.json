        "reasoning": "We have a satellite initially in a circular geostationary orbit. We want to transfer it to a circular polar orbit of the same radius using a single, instantaneous out-of-plane maneuver. For a circular orbit of radius r, the orbital speed is $V = \\sqrt{\\mu / r}$, independent of inclination. A pure plane change at constant speed changes only the direction of the velocity vector, not its magnitude. The angle between the initial (equatorial, prograde) orbit and the final polar orbit is 90\\degree. For a plane change through angle $\\Delta i$ at speed $V$, the required velocity change is $\\Delta V = 2 V \\sin(\\Delta i/2)$. Here $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$, so $\\Delta V = 2 V \\sin 45^\\circ = 2 V (\\sqrt{2}/2) = \\sqrt{2} V$. The escape velocity at the same radius is $V_{esc} = \\sqrt{2 \\mu / r} = \\sqrt{2} V$. Therefore $\\Delta V = V_{esc}$, so the ratio is 1.0, which lies in the official range 0.99 to 1.01."

          "Step 4: Here the inclination change is from equatorial (0\\degree) to polar (90\\degree), so $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$. Substitute into the formula: $\\Delta V = 2 V \\sin(45^\\circ) = 2 V (\\sqrt{2}/2) = \\sqrt{2} V$.",
          "Step 5: The escape velocity at radius r is $V_{esc} = \\sqrt{2 \\mu / r}$. Since $V = \\sqrt{\\mu / r}$, we get $V_{esc} = \\sqrt{2} V$.",
