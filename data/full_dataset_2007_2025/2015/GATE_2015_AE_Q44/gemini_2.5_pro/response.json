        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the change in velocity ($\\Delta V$) required to transfer a satellite from a geostationary orbit to a circular polar orbit of the same radius, through a single impulse out-of-plane maneuver. The result should be expressed as a multiple of the escape velocity ($V_{escape}$) from that radius.\n\n1.  **Initial and Final Orbits:**\n    *   Initial: Geostationary orbit (circular, equatorial, inclination $i_{initial} = 0^\\circ$, radius $r_{geo}$). Its orbital velocity is $V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$.\n    *   Final: Circular polar orbit (circular, inclination $i_{final} = 90^\\circ$, radius $r_{final} = r_{geo}$). Its orbital velocity magnitude is also $V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$, as the radius is the same.\n\n2.  **Out-of-Plane Maneuver (Inclination Change):**\n    *   For a single-impulse maneuver to change the orbital inclination from $i_{initial}$ to $i_{final}$ while maintaining the magnitude of the orbital velocity $V_{orbit}$, the required change in velocity ($\\Delta V$) is given by:\n        $\\Delta V = 2V_{orbit} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta i}{2}\\right)$\n    *   Here, the change in inclination is $\\Delta i = i_{final} - i_{initial} = 90^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.\n    *   Substituting these values:\n        $\\Delta V = 2V_{orbit} \\sin\\left(\\frac{90^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 2V_{orbit} \\sin(45^\\circ)$\n    *   Since $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n        $\\Delta V = 2V_{orbit} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}$\n\n3.  **Escape Velocity:**\n    *   The escape velocity from an orbit of radius $r_{geo}$ is given by:\n        $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$\n    *   We know that $V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$. Therefore, we can relate $V_{escape}$ to $V_{orbit}$:\n        $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}} = \\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}$\n\n4.  **Ratio Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{escape}}$:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{escape}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}}{\\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}} = 1$\n\nThus, the magnitude of the change in velocity required is 1 times the magnitude of the escape velocity."

          "**Step 1: Understand the Initial and Final Orbits.** The satellite starts in a geostationary orbit, which is a circular orbit with $0^\\circ$ inclination (equatorial) at a specific radius $r_{geo}$. It needs to transfer to a circular polar orbit, which has a $90^\\circ$ inclination, but importantly, at the *same radius* $r_{geo}$.",
          "**Step 2: Determine the Orbital Velocity.** For any circular orbit, the orbital speed is given by $V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$, where $\\mu$ is the gravitational parameter of the central body (Earth) and $r$ is the orbital radius. Since the radius remains the same ($r_{geo}$), the magnitude of the satellite's velocity before and after the maneuver is identical, $V = V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$.",
          "**Step 3: Identify the Maneuver Type.** The problem specifies a 'single impulse out-of-plane maneuver'. This means the maneuver primarily changes the orbital plane (inclination) without changing the orbital radius or speed magnitude. The change in inclination ($\\Delta i$) is $90^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.",
          "**Step 4: Apply the Inclination Change \\Delta V Formula.** The magnitude of the velocity change ($\\Delta V$) required for a pure inclination change $\\Delta i$ at a constant orbital speed $V$ is given by the formula: $\\Delta V = 2V \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta i}{2}\\right)$.",
          "**Step 5: Calculate \\Delta V.** Substitute $V = V_{orbit}$ and $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$ into the formula: $\\Delta V = 2V_{orbit} \\sin\\left(\\frac{90^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 2V_{orbit} \\sin(45^\\circ)$.",
          "**Step 6: Simplify \\Delta V.** Since $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the expression for $\\Delta V$ becomes: $\\Delta V = 2V_{orbit} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}$.",
          "**Step 7: Determine the Escape Velocity.** The escape velocity ($V_{escape}$) from the same radius $r_{geo}$ is given by $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$. Recognizing that $V_{orbit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}}$, we can write $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{geo}}} = \\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}$.",
          "**Step 8: Calculate the Required Ratio.** Finally, compute the ratio of the change in velocity to the escape velocity: $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{escape}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}}{\\sqrt{2}V_{orbit}} = 1$. The answer is 1."
