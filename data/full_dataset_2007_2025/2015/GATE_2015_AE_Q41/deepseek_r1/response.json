    "question_text": "A massless cantilever beam PQ has a solid square cross section (10 mm x 10 mm). This beam is subjected to a load W through a rigid massless link at the point Q, as shown below (figure not to scale). If the Young's modulus of the material E = 200 GPa, the deflection (in mm) at point Q is ______."
