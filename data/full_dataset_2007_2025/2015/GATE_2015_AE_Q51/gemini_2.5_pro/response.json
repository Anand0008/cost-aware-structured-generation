        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the velocity increment of a liquid propellant rocket at burnout while operating in outer space, implying the use of the ideal rocket equation (Tsiolkovsky rocket equation) where gravity and drag losses are negligible. First, the total initial mass ($M_i$) is calculated by summing all component masses: payload, fuel, oxidizer, structures, and guidance systems. Next, the total propellant mass ($M_p$) is determined by summing the fuel and oxidizer masses. The final mass ($M_f$) after burnout is then $M_i - M_p$. With the effective exhaust velocity ($c$) given, the velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) is calculated using the formula $\\Delta V = c \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_i}{M_f}\\right)$. The calculated value of approximately 5.448 km/s falls within the specified correct answer range of 5.42 to 5.48 km/s."
