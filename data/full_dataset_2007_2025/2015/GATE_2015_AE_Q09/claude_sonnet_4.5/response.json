This is a geometric problem that can be solved by enumerating all possible combinations of integer coordinates that satisfy the given inequalities.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. The x-coordinates must be in the range [-4, 5], which gives 10 possible values.\n2. For each x-coordinate, the y-coordinate must be in the range [6, 16], which gives 11 possible values.\n3. Since the triangle is right-angled, the coordinates of the vertices must be integers.\n4.
