        "reasoning": "The sentence 'Apparent lifelessness ____________ dormant life' requires a verb that conveys the idea of containing, concealing, or having something hidden within. Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. harbours**: To 'harbour' means to keep or conceal (a person or thing), or to be the home or resting place for. In this context, it perfectly implies that beneath the outward appearance of lifelessness, there is hidden or inactive life. For example, a seemingly barren desert might harbour dormant seeds.\n*   **B. leads to**: This implies causation or a consequence. Apparent lifelessness does not necessarily 'lead to' dormant life; rather, it might contain it.\n*   **C. supports**: This implies providing assistance or holding something up. Apparent lifelessness does not 'support' dormant life in the sense of providing aid.\n*   **D. affects**: This implies influence. While apparent lifelessness might 'affect' dormant life, this word does not capture the sense of containment or hidden presence as accurately as 'harbours'.\n\nTherefore, 'harbours' is the most appropriate word to complete the sentence, conveying that dormant life exists within or is concealed by the apparent lifelessness."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the core meaning of the sentence. The sentence describes a relationship between 'apparent lifelessness' (something that seems dead or inactive) and 'dormant life' (life that is present but inactive or hidden).",
          "Step 2: Identify the implied relationship. The sentence suggests that the 'apparent lifelessness' is a state or condition that holds, contains, or conceals the 'dormant life'.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate each option based on its meaning and how it fits the implied relationship.",
          "Step 4: Consider option A, 'harbours'. To 'harbour' means to keep or conceal, or to be a refuge for. This fits the context perfectly, implying that the lifeless appearance is a vessel or cover for the hidden, inactive life.",
          "Step 5: Consider option B, 'leads to'. This implies cause and effect. Apparent lifelessness doesn't cause dormant life; dormant life exists despite or within the apparent lifelessness.",
          "Step 6: Consider option C, 'supports'. This implies providing assistance or sustenance. Apparent lifelessness does not actively support dormant life in this context.",
          "Step 7: Consider option D, 'affects'. This implies influence. While lifelessness might affect dormant life, it doesn't convey the sense of containment or hidden presence that the sentence structure suggests.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that 'harbours' is the most semantically appropriate and grammatically correct choice, as it best expresses the idea of containing or concealing the dormant life within the apparent lifelessness."
