        "reasoning": "The word 'harbours' means to contain or shelter, often secretly. 'Apparent lifelessness' suggests a state that seems devoid of life but actually contains dormant (hidden/inactive) life. Thus, 'harbours' is the most fitting choice. 'Leads to' implies causation, 'supports' implies aiding or bearing weight, and 'affects' implies influence; none accurately convey the meaning of containing something hidden within."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Read the incomplete sentence: 'Apparent lifelessness ____________ dormant life.' Understand the context: 'Apparent' means seeming or appearing, so 'apparent lifelessness' is a state that looks lifeless but may not be truly lifeless. 'Dormant life' refers to life that is inactive, hidden, or in a suspended state.",
          "Step 2: Analyze each option in the context: A. 'harbours' - to contain or shelter, often secretly. B. 'leads to' - causes or results in. C. 'supports' - bears the weight of, assists, or sustains. D. 'affects' - influences or has an impact on.",
          "Step 3: Determine the logical relationship: The sentence suggests that within something that appears lifeless, there exists dormant life. The key idea is containment or concealment, not causation, assistance, or influence.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each option against this relationship: 'Harbours' directly fits as it means to contain something hidden. 'Leads to' would imply lifelessness causes dormant life, which is illogical. 'Supports' implies lifelessness helps dormant life exist, which is not the intended meaning. 'Affects' is too vague and does not convey containment.",
          "Step 5: Confirm the completed sentence: 'Apparent lifelessness harbours dormant life.' is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful, expressing the idea that what seems lifeless actually contains hidden life."
