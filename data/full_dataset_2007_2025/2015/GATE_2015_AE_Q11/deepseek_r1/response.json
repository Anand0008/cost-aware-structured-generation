Thus, the PDE becomes $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. The highest order derivative is first order (partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$), so it is first order. The term $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ is a product of the dependent variable $u$ and its derivative, making the equation non-linear (it does not satisfy superposition).
