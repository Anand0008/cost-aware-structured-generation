        "reasoning": "The stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio (or air-fuel ratio) is a fundamental chemical property of the fuel and the oxidizer (air). It represents the exact proportion of fuel and air required for complete combustion, where all the fuel and oxygen are consumed, theoretically producing only carbon dioxide and water. This ratio is determined by the chemical composition of the fuel and air, and is independent of the operating conditions of the engine, such as compressor pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, or flight speed. While the *actual* fuel-to-air ratio in an engine combustor varies significantly with operating conditions to achieve desired thrust, efficiency, and stable combustion (often operating lean of stoichiometric), the *stoichiometric* ratio itself remains constant for a given fuel type. RAG Chunk 2 explicitly defines the stoichiometric ratio as the 'chemically correct air-fuel ratio for complete combustion' and discusses how engines operate within a 'safe fuel-air ratio zone' *around* this stoichiometric ideal, implying the ideal itself is fixed."

          "Step 1: Understand the definition of stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio. It is the chemically ideal ratio of fuel mass to air mass for complete combustion, where all reactants are consumed.",
          "Step 2: Recognize that this ratio is determined solely by the chemical composition of the fuel and the oxidizer (air). For example, for kerosene (a common jet fuel) and air, the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is approximately 14.7:1, meaning 14.7 kg of air is needed for every 1 kg of fuel.",
          "Step 3: Consider the compressor pressure ratio. This is an engine operating parameter that dictates the pressure rise across the compressor. It affects the density and temperature of the air entering the combustor, and thus influences the *actual* fuel flow rate required to achieve a certain turbine inlet temperature or thrust.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate if the compressor pressure ratio changes the fundamental chemical requirement for complete combustion. Since the chemical composition of fuel and air remains constant regardless of the pressure they are at (within typical engine operating ranges), the stoichiometric ratio does not change.",
          "Step 5: Conclude that the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio is independent of the compressor pressure ratio. The engine's control system adjusts the *actual* fuel flow to maintain stable combustion and desired performance, which might be lean or rich relative to stoichiometric, but the stoichiometric reference point itself is fixed."
