        "reasoning": "The stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio is a fundamental chemical property determined by the composition of the fuel (e.g., jet fuel, typically kerosene-based) and the oxidizer (air). It is defined by the balanced chemical equation for complete combustion. For a given fuel-air pair, it is a constant value (e.g., approximately 0.067 for typical jet fuel and air). It does NOT depend on engine operating conditions, thermodynamic cycle parameters like compressor pressure ratio, or flight conditions. Therefore, it is independent."

Changing the compressor pressure ratio does not alter the atomic composition of fuel or air, hence f_stoic remains constant.",
