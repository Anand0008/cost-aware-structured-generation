This is consistent with the fundamental combustion principles discussed in the retrieved knowledge. The fuel-to-air ratio is primarily determined by the desired combustor outlet temperature and the fuel's calorific value, and is not directly affected by the compressor pressure ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 'is independent'."
