If the load is applied at any other point, it creates both a bending moment and a torsional moment. Therefore, when a lateral force is applied at the shear center of a cantilever, the beam will undergo bending without twisting. This is explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 5)."
