If the load is applied away from the shear center, the eccentricity produces a torque causing twisting in addition to bending. In this problem, the cantilever with a thin-walled channel cross section is explicitly loaded at its shear center by a lateral force. Therefore, by definition, the beam will undergo pure bending with no torsional moment about its longitudinal axis, i.e., bending without twisting. This matches option A."
