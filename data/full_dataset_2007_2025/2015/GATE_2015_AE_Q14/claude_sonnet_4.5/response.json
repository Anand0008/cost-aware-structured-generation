According to the explanation in the retrieved knowledge, when a shear force is applied at the shear center of an open-section beam, the beam will undergo bending without any twisting. This is because the shear center is the unique point in the cross-section where a transverse shear load can be applied without inducing torsion. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 'bending without twisting'."
