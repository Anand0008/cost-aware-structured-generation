        "reasoning": "Aircraft dynamic modes are characterized by the nature of their roots (eigenvalues) in the complex s-plane. Oscillatory modes have complex conjugate roots (e.g., $s = \\sigma \\pm j\\omega$), indicating a periodic motion that decays or diverges. Non-oscillatory modes have real roots (e.g., $s = \\sigma$), indicating a direct exponential decay or divergence without oscillation.\n\nLet's analyze the given options based on the retrieved knowledge:\n*   **A. Short Period Mode:** This is a longitudinal oscillatory mode. It is characterized by rapid damping and a relatively high frequency, involving changes in angle of attack and pitch rate. Its roots are complex conjugate (Chunk 2, 6).\n*   **B. Phugoid Mode:** This is also a longitudinal oscillatory mode. It is characterized by light damping and a very low frequency, involving slow exchanges between speed and altitude. Its roots are complex conjugate (Chunk 2, 6).\n*   **C. Dutch Roll Mode:** This is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode. It is characterized by coupled yawing, rolling, and sideslipping motions. Its roots are complex conjugate (Chunk 1, 2, 3).\n*   **D. Spiral Mode:** This is a lateral-directional non-oscillatory mode. It describes a slow, gradual divergence (if unstable) or convergence (if stable) in bank angle and heading without any oscillatory behavior. Its root is real, often very close to zero (Chunk 1, 2, 3).\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only the Spiral mode exhibits non-oscillatory response characteristics."

The Dutch Roll mode is an oscillatory lateral-directional mode, also having complex conjugate roots (as per Chunk 1, 2, and 3).
