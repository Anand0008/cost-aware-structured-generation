        "Control Systems": "Damping ratio ($\\zeta$) is a critical parameter in control system design, influencing the transient response (overshoot, settling time) of a system. An underdamped system (low $\\zeta$) corresponds to oscillatory behavior, while an overdamped system (high $\\zeta$) is sluggish.",
        "Dynamics and Kinematics": "The fundamental equations of motion for SDOF systems are derived from Newton's second law, which is a core concept in dynamics.",
        "Material Science": "The damping properties of materials (e.g., viscoelasticity) contribute to the overall damping coefficient of a system. Understanding material behavior is key to predicting and designing damping.",
        "Signal Processing": "Analyzing vibration decay curves (e.g., using Fourier transforms) to extract frequency and damping information is a common application of signal processing techniques."

Chunks 1 and 6 provided the exact formulas and a similar example calculation for all required parameters (natural frequency, critical damping, damping ratio, logarithmic decrement, and ratio of successive amplitudes). Chunk 2 provided another example reinforcing the calculations. Chunk 4 defined logarithmic decrement. Chunks 3 and 5, while related to damping, discussed limitations of proportional damping models, which was not directly needed for this specific calculation but provided good background context."
