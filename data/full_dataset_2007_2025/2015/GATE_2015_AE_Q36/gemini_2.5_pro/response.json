        "reasoning": "The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients: $y'' - 2y' + y = 0$. \\n1. The characteristic equation is formed by replacing $y''$ with $m^2$, $y'$ with $m$, and $y$ with $1$: $m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0$. \\n2. This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(m-1)^2 = 0$. \\n3. The roots are $m_1 = m_2 = 1$, which are real and repeated. \\n4. For repeated real roots $m$, the general solution is $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{mx}$. Substituting $m=1$, we get $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^x$. \\n5. The problem states that the integration constants are identical, so $C_1 = C_2 = C$. Substituting this into the general solution yields $y(x) = (C + C x)e^x = C(1+x)e^x$. \\n6. One initial condition is given as $y(0) = 1$. Applying this condition: $1 = C(1+0)e^0 \\implies 1 = C(1)(1) \\implies C = 1$. \\n7. Substituting $C=1$ back into the solution, the particular solution is $y(x) = (1+x)e^x$. \\n8. To find the other initial condition, $y'(0)$, we first need to find the derivative $y'(x)$. Using the product rule $\\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv'$ where $u=(1+x)$ and $v=e^x$: \\n$y'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((1+x)e^x) = (\\frac{d}{dx}(1+x))e^x + (1+x)(\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x))$ \\n$y'(x) = 1 \\cdot e^x + (1+x)e^x = e^x(1 + 1 + x) = (2+x)e^x$. \\n9. Finally, evaluate $y'(x)$ at $x=0$: $y'(0) = (2+0)e^0 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. \\nTherefore, the other initial condition $y'(0) = 2$."

However, they did not provide the specific methodology for solving second-order linear homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients (characteristic equation, solution forms for repeated roots) which was essential for the core solution. I relied on internal knowledge for these specific solution techniques."
