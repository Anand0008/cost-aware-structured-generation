For a thin airfoil, the 2D lift-curve slope $a_0$ is $2\\pi$ per radian. When the aspect ratio $AR \\rightarrow \\infty$, the term $a_0 / (\\pi AR)$ approaches 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to $a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + 0} = a_0$. Substituting $a_0 = 2\\pi$ per radian, we get $a = 2\\pi \\approx 6.28318$. The provided correct answer range of 6.27 to 6.29 is consistent with this calculated value."
