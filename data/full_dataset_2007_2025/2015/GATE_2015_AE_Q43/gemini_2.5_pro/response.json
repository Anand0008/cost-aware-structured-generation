The pitching moment coefficient about the leading edge ($c_{m,le}$) for a symmetric airfoil is $c_{m,le} = -c_l/4$. To find the pitching moment coefficient about the trailing edge ($c_{m,te}$), we use the moment transfer formula: $c_{m,x_2} = c_{m,x_1} + c_l \\left( \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{c} \\right)$.\\n\\nGiven:\\nAngle of attack, $\\alpha = 2^{\\circ}$\\n\\nStep 1: Convert angle of attack to radians.\\n$\\alpha_{\\text{rad}} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{90} \\text{ rad} \\approx 0.034906585 \\text{ rad}$\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate the lift coefficient ($c_l$).\\n$c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha_{\\text{rad}} = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\pi}{90} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{45} \\approx \\frac{9.8696044}{45} \\approx 0.2193245$\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the pitching moment coefficient about the leading edge ($c_{m,le}$).\\n$c_{m,le} = -\\frac{c_l}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{\\pi^2}{45} = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{180} \\approx -\\frac{9.8696044}{180} \\approx -0.0548311$\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the pitching moment coefficient about the trailing edge ($c_{m,te}$) using the moment transfer formula.\\nHere, $x_1 = 0$ (leading edge) and $x_2 = c$ (trailing edge).
