Equating these two dominant terms (as per boundary layer theory) gives $\\delta^2 \\sim \\nu L / U_\\infty = L^2 / Re$, leading to $\\delta \\sim L / \\sqrt{Re}$. Therefore, for a fixed characteristic length L, δ is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{Re}$.

          "Step 1: Understand the context. In laminar boundary layer theory, the flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations simplified under the boundary layer approximations. The key balance is between the inertial (convection) term and the viscous diffusion term in the direction normal to the wall.",
          "Step 2: Write the relevant form of the x-momentum equation for a steady, 2D, incompressible laminar boundary layer: $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$. For a flat plate with zero pressure gradient, this simplifies to $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$.",
          "Step 3: Perform order-of-magnitude scaling. Let $U_\\infty$ be the characteristic velocity outside the boundary layer, $L$ be the characteristic streamwise length, and $\\delta$ be the characteristic boundary layer thickness (the length scale in the y-direction).",
          "Step 4: Scale the convection term $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$. Velocity $u$ scales as $U_\\infty$. The derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ scales as $1/L$. Therefore, the convection term scales as $U_\\infty \\cdot (U_\\infty / L) = U_\\infty^2 / L$.",
          "Step 5: Scale the viscous term $\\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$. The second derivative in y is crucial. The velocity changes from 0 to $U_\\infty$ over a distance $\\delta$, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\sim U_\\infty / \\delta$, and thus $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\sim (U_\\infty / \\delta) / \\delta = U_\\infty / \\delta^2$. The viscous term therefore scales as $\\nu \\cdot (U_\\infty / \\delta^2)$.",

          "Step 7: Solve for $\\delta$. Cancel $U_\\infty$: $U_\\infty / L \\sim \\nu / \\delta^2$. Rearranging gives $\\delta^2 \\sim \\nu L / U_\\infty$. Recognize that $Re = \\frac{U_\\infty L}{\\nu}$, so $\\nu / U_\\infty = L / Re$. Substitute: $\\delta^2 \\sim L \\cdot (L / Re) = L^2 / Re$. Hence, $\\delta \\sim L / \\sqrt{Re}$.",
