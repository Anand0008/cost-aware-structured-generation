        "reasoning": "The biplane has two wings, effectively doubling the total lifting surface area compared to the monoplane (assuming identical chord for each wing as the monoplane). This results in higher total lift generation. However, this increased lift and the aerodynamic interference between the two wings (mutual downwash effects, increased wetted area) lead to higher total drag, encompassing both increased profile drag and induced drag. The RAG context confirms that induced drag is 'drag due to lift' and increases with lift squared. While the RAG does not specifically discuss biplanes, the principles of finite wing aerodynamics and induced drag apply."

          "Step 1: Identify the key difference: A biplane consists of two wings (stacked vertically) while a monoplane has one wing. Given identical airfoil sections, wingspans (b), and incidence angles (α), the primary variable is the total planform area.",
          "Step 2: Analyze lift generation. Lift is proportional to wing area (S), lift coefficient (C_L), and dynamic pressure. For the same airfoil at the same α, the 2D section lift coefficient (c_l) is the same. The total lift of the biplane is approximately the sum of the lift from its two wings. Therefore, for the same span and chord, the biplane's total wing area is roughly double that of the monoplane, leading to higher total lift. Even accounting for interference (reduced effective α due to mutual downwash), the net lift is higher.",
          "Step 3: Analyze drag generation. Total drag has two main components: profile drag (skin friction + pressure drag) and induced drag (drag due to lift).",
          "Step 4: Profile Drag: The biplane has more wetted area (approximately double the surface area), leading to higher profile drag.",
          "Step 5: Induced Drag: Induced drag is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient and inversely proportional to aspect ratio (AR) and Oswald efficiency factor (e). For the biplane, the total lift is higher, so C_L (based on a reference area) is higher, significantly increasing induced drag (C_D,i ∝ C_L^2). Furthermore, aerodynamic interference between the two wings reduces the overall efficiency (effectively lowering 'e' or increasing interference drag), further increasing induced drag compared to an isolated monoplane wing of the same total area and lift.",
          "Step 6: Conclusion: The biplane experiences both higher lift (due to greater total lifting area) and higher drag (due to increased profile drag and significantly increased induced drag from higher lift and interference effects)."
