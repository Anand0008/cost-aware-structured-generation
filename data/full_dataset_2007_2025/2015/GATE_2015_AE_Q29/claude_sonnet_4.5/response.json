        "reasoning": "The key difference between a monoplane and a biplane wing is the presence of additional wingtip vortices in the biplane configuration. These wingtip vortices induce a stronger downwash on the biplane wing, which reduces the effective angle of attack experienced by the airfoil sections. This reduction in effective angle of attack leads to a lower lift coefficient for the biplane wing compared to the monoplane wing.\n\nHowever, the increased number of wingtip vortices in the biplane also leads to higher induced drag. The induced drag is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient, so the biplane will experience a higher induced drag compared to the monoplane wing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: the biplane will experience a higher lift and a higher drag compared to the monoplane wing with the same airfoil sections, wingspan, and incidence angles."
