        "reasoning": "Both wings use the same airfoil, span, and incidence in the same tunnel conditions. A biplane has two lifting surfaces, so for the same angle of attack each wing produces lift; total lift is roughly the sum of the two, so total lift is higher than that of a single monoplane wing. However, the two wings are close to each other, so their tip vortices and downwash fields interact. This mutual interference increases induced drag compared to a single wing of the same span. Also, there is more wetted area (two wings instead of one), so profile (skin-friction + pressure) drag is higher. Thus, compared to the monoplane, the biplane experiences higher lift but also higher drag. That matches option A."

          "Step 3: Drag has two main components here: profile drag (skin friction + pressure drag) and induced drag (drag due to lift and tip vortices). Two wings mean more wetted area, so profile drag increases.",
          "Step 4: The two wings are close vertically, so their tip vortices and downwash fields interact. This mutual interference increases induced drag beyond that of a single wing of the same span.",
