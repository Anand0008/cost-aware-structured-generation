        "reasoning": "A statically stable aircraft, by definition, produces a restoring moment when disturbed from its trimmed condition. In trimmed flight, the center of pressure (CP) is coincident with the center of gravity (CG) for zero net moment (as per RAG Chunk 5). When a gust reduces the angle of attack (α), the lift on the main wing decreases. For a stable aircraft (CG ahead of neutral point), the center of pressure location is a function of α. A decrease in α causes the CP to move forward on the wing (towards the leading edge). This forward shift moves the resultant lift vector ahead of the CG, creating a nose-up (positive) pitching moment. This moment acts to increase α back towards its trimmed value, fulfilling the definition of static stability. RAG Chunk 1 explicitly states: 'when a gust decreases the angle of attack, the center of pressure must shift forward.' Therefore, the correct answer is A (shifts forward)."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the initial condition. The aircraft is statically stable and trimmed. This means: (a) The sum of moments about the center of gravity (CG) is zero (\\[M_{cg} = 0\\]), and (b) The slope of the pitching moment coefficient curve vs. lift coefficient is negative (\\[\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0\\]) or, equivalently, the CG is ahead of the neutral point (\\[h < h_n\\]).",
          "Step 2: Analyze the disturbance. A gust momentarily reduces the angle of attack (\\[\\alpha\\] decreases). Consequently, the lift coefficient (\\[C_L\\]) decreases (\\[\\Delta C_L < 0\\]).",
          "Step 3: Recall the physical mechanism of static stability. For a stable aircraft, when \\[\\alpha\\] increases, the center of pressure (CP) moves aft, causing a nose-down restoring moment. Conversely, when \\[\\alpha\\] decreases, the CP must move forward to generate a nose-up restoring moment (RAG Chunk 1).",
          "Step 4: Visualize the effect. The forward shift of the CP places the resultant aerodynamic lift force vector ahead of the CG. This creates a positive (nose-up) pitching moment about the CG (\\[\\Delta M_{cg} > 0\\]), which tends to increase \\[\\alpha\\] back to its trimmed value.",
          "Step 5: Eliminate incorrect options. Option B is the opposite of the correct behavior. Option C is false because the CP location varies with \\[\\alpha\\] for a stable configuration. Option D describes a condition of neutral stability (static margin = 0), which is not the scenario; the aircraft is statically stable, so its CG is ahead of the neutral point, not coincident with it."
