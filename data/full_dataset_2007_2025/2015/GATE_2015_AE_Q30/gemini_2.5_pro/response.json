        "reasoning": "For an aircraft to be statically stable, it must possess a restoring moment that tends to bring it back to its equilibrium state after a disturbance. The center of pressure (CP) is the point where the resultant aerodynamic force acts, and its position relative to the center of gravity (CG) determines the pitching moment.\n\n1.  **Understanding Static Stability:** A statically stable aircraft generates a moment that *opposes* any change in angle of attack ($\\alpha$).\n2.  **Analyzing the Disturbance:** The question states that the angle of attack reduces momentarily due to a gust. This means $\\Delta \\alpha < 0$.\n3.  **Required Restoring Moment:** To oppose this reduction in $\\alpha$, the aircraft must generate a nose-up (pitch-up) restoring moment. This moment will tend to increase $\\alpha$ back towards its trimmed value.\n4.  **Relating to CP Shift:** A nose-up moment about the CG is generated when the effective total aerodynamic force (lift) acts *forward* of the CG. Therefore, for a statically stable aircraft experiencing a decrease in $\\alpha$, the center of pressure must shift forward relative to the CG.\n5.  **Confirmation from RAG:** This principle is explicitly stated in CHUNK 1 of the retrieved knowledge: \"Static stability requires that the shift in the center of pressure be rearward when the angle of attack increases, creating a restoring moment about the center of gravity. Conversely, when a gust decreases the angle of attack, the center of pressure must shift forward.\"\n\nBased on this, when the angle of attack reduces, the center of pressure shifts forward."

For a nose-up moment to be generated about the center of gravity (CG), the effective point of action of the lift force (the CP) must shift *forward* relative to the CG. If the lift acts forward of the CG, it creates a nose-up moment.",
