The objective is to find the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$).",
          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental relationship between power required, thrust required, and velocity. For steady, level, unaccelerated flight, thrust ($T$) equals drag ($D$), and lift ($L$) equals weight ($W$). The power required ($P$) is given by $P = T \\times V$. Since $T=D$, we have $P = D \\times V$.",
          "Step 3: Relate drag ($D$) to weight ($W$) and the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$). We know that $L/D = W/D$ (since $L=W$ in level flight). Therefore, $D = W / (L/D)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the expression for drag ($D$) into the power required equation. This gives $P = \\left( \\frac{W}{L/D} \\right) \\times V$. This formula directly links all the given quantities with the unknown $L/D$ ratio.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the formula to solve for the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$). The equation becomes $L/D = \\frac{W \\times V}{P}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the given numerical values into the rearranged formula and calculate the result. $L/D = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N}) \\times (300 \\text{ m/s})}{9 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}}$.",
          "Step 7: Perform the calculation: $L/D = \\frac{4.5 \\times 10^7 \\text{ N m/s}}{9 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}}$. Since $1 \\text{ W} = 1 \\text{ N m/s}$, the units cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio. $L/D = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.0$."
