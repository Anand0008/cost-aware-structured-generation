        "reasoning": "A vertical tail's primary function is to provide directional stability and control. It needs to generate side forces in response to sideslip, but ideally, it should not generate any side force (lift) at zero sideslip angle. To achieve this, a symmetric airfoil is required, as symmetric airfoils have zero camber and thus produce zero lift at zero angle of attack (or zero sideslip in the case of a vertical tail). Let's analyze the given options based on NACA airfoil numbering systems, as detailed in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 and 6):\n\n*   **A. NACA 0012:** The first two digits '00' explicitly indicate zero maximum camber and zero location of maximum camber. This defines a symmetric airfoil. The '12' indicates a maximum thickness of 12% of the chord. A symmetric airfoil is perfectly suited for a vertical tail.\n*   **B. NACA 2312:** This is a NACA four-digit series airfoil. The first digit '2' indicates a maximum camber of 2% of the chord, and the second digit '3' indicates the location of maximum camber at 30% (0.3c) from the leading edge. This is a cambered airfoil, designed to produce lift at zero angle of attack, which is undesirable for a vertical tail at zero sideslip.\n*   **C. NACA 23012:** This is a NACA five-digit series airfoil. The '230' part indicates a design lift coefficient of 0.3 (first digit '2' multiplied by 3/2) and the location of maximum camber at 15% (30/2) of the chord. This is also a cambered airfoil, designed for a specific lift performance, making it inappropriate for a vertical tail's primary function.\n*   **D. Clarke Y profile:** While not a NACA airfoil, the Clarke Y is a well-known historical airfoil that is cambered, not symmetric. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a vertical tail.\n\nBased on this analysis, NACA 0012 is the only symmetric airfoil among the choices and is thus the most appropriate for a vertical tail."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the functional requirement of a vertical tail. A vertical tail is primarily responsible for directional stability and control. It needs to generate side forces when the aircraft yaws (sideslips) but should ideally produce no side force at zero sideslip to avoid unwanted trim forces.",
          "Step 2: Determine the ideal airfoil characteristic for this function. An airfoil that produces zero lift (or side force) at zero angle of attack (or sideslip) is required. This characteristic is inherent to symmetric airfoils, which have no camber.",
          "Step 3: Recall the NACA airfoil numbering system, specifically how camber is indicated. For NACA four-digit series airfoils (like NACA 2412 or NACA 0012), the first digit represents the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord, and the second digit represents the location of maximum camber. A symmetric airfoil has '00' for its first two digits (Chunk 1, 6). For NACA five-digit series airfoils (like NACA 23012), the first digit (multiplied by 3/2) gives the design lift coefficient, implying camber (Chunk 1, 6).",
          "Step 4: Analyze each option based on the NACA numbering rules and the requirement for a symmetric airfoil.",
          "Step 5: Identify NACA 0012 as the symmetric airfoil. The '00' in NACA 0012 directly indicates zero camber, making it a symmetric airfoil suitable for a vertical tail. The other NACA options (2312, 23012) are cambered, and the Clarke Y is also a cambered profile."
