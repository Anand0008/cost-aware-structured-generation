        "reasoning": "The NACA 0012 airfoil is an appropriate choice for a vertical tail. The NACA 0012 is a symmetric airfoil, meaning it has no camber (the first two digits are 00). This makes it well-suited for vertical stabilizers, which need to generate lift in both positive and negative angles of attack. The 12 in the designation indicates the maximum thickness is 12% of the chord, which provides sufficient structural integrity for the vertical tail. In contrast, the NACA 2312 and 23012 airfoils have camber, making them more suitable for wings that need to generate lift in a specific direction. The Clarke Y profile is also not an appropriate choice, as it is a different airfoil family not part of the NACA series."
