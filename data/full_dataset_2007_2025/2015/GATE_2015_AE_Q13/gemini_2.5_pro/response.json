        "reasoning": "The question describes a linear mass-spring-dashpot system in free vibration that is 'over-damped'. The behavior of such a system is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation, which in turn depend on the damping ratio ($\\zeta$).\n\n1.  **Equation of Motion:** For a linear mass-spring-dashpot system undergoing free vibration, the equation of motion is given by: \n    `$m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = 0$`\n    where `$m$` is mass, `$c$` is damping coefficient, `$k$` is spring stiffness, `$x$` is displacement, `$\\dot{x}$` is velocity, and `$\\ddot{x}$` is acceleration (as seen in RAG Chunk 2).\n\n2.  **Characteristic Equation:** Assuming a solution of the form `$x(t) = e^{\\lambda t}$`, substituting this into the equation of motion yields the characteristic equation:\n    `$m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0$`\n\n3.  **Roots of the Characteristic Equation:** The roots `$\\lambda_{1,2}$` are given by the quadratic formula:\n    `$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4mk}}{2m}$`\n\n4.  **Damping Ratio ($\\zeta$):** To analyze the nature of the roots, we introduce the damping ratio `$\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2 \\sqrt{mk}}$` and the natural circular frequency `$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$`. The roots can then be expressed as:\n    `$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\omega_n \\left( -\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\right)$`\n\n5.  **Over-damped Condition:** For an over-damped system, the damping ratio `$\\zeta > 1$`. In this case, the term `$\\zeta^2 - 1$` is positive, meaning `$\\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}$` is a real number. Consequently, both roots `$\\lambda_1$` and `$\\lambda_2$` are real, distinct, and negative.\n\n6.  **System Response:** The general solution for an over-damped system is:\n    `$x(t) = C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}$`\n    Since `$\\lambda_1$` and `$\\lambda_2$` are real and negative, the solution consists of two exponentially decaying terms. There are no imaginary components in the roots, which means there are no sinusoidal (oscillatory) terms in the response. The system returns to its equilibrium position exponentially without crossing the equilibrium position more than once (or at most once, depending on initial conditions) and without oscillating.\n\nTherefore, an over-damped system undergoes non-oscillatory motion. Option A is correct."

          "Step 1: Identify the system and its state. The question describes a 'linear mass-spring-dashpot system' in 'free vibration' and specifies that it is 'over-damped'.",
          "Step 2: Recall the general equation of motion for a damped single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system in free vibration. This is given by `$m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = 0$`, where `$m$` is mass, `$c$` is the damping coefficient, and `$k$` is the spring stiffness (RAG Chunk 2).",
          "Step 3: Understand the concept of damping ratio ($\\zeta$) and its role in classifying damped systems. The damping ratio is defined as `$\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2 \\sqrt{mk}}$`. This dimensionless parameter dictates the nature of the system's response.",
          "Step 4: Apply the condition for an 'over-damped' system. An over-damped system is characterized by a damping ratio `$\\zeta > 1$`. This means the damping force is very strong relative to the restoring and inertial forces.",
          "Step 5: Determine the nature of the roots of the characteristic equation for an over-damped system. The characteristic equation is `$m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0$`. Its roots are `$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\omega_n \\left( -\\zeta \\pm \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\right)$`. For `$\\zeta > 1$`, the term `$\\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}$` is a real number, and thus both roots `$\\lambda_1$` and `$\\lambda_2$` are real, distinct, and negative.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the type of motion based on the roots. Since the roots are real and negative, the solution `$x(t) = C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}$` will be a sum of two exponentially decaying terms. This type of response does not involve oscillations; the system slowly returns to its equilibrium position without crossing it or oscillating. Therefore, the motion is non-oscillatory."

However, the RAG context *did not explicitly define or explain the specific behavior of an over-damped system* (i.e., the conditions for `$\\zeta > 1$` and the resulting non-oscillatory motion). This crucial part required internal knowledge to complete the analysis."
