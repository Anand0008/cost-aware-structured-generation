The sideslip angle \\(\\beta\\) is calculated as \\(\\beta = \\arcsin(v / |\\vec{v}_a|)\\), where \\(v\\) is the y-component of \\(\\vec{v}_a^b\\). Calculation yields \\(\\vec{v}_a^b = (100, 10, 15)\\) m/s, magnitude \\(|\\vec{v}_a| \\approx 101.61 \\) m/s, and \\(\\beta = \\arcsin(10/101.61) \\approx 5.65^\\circ\\)."

The wind speed \\(\\vec{v}_w^b\\) is the velocity of the air mass relative to the inertial frame, also expressed in body axes. The aircraft's velocity relative to the air (airspeed vector, \\(\\vec{v}_a^b\\)) is what determines aerodynamic angles.",
          "Step 2: Compute the airspeed vector in the body frame. \\(\\vec{v}_a^b = \\vec{v}_g^b - \\vec{v}_w^b\\).

However, no chunk explicitly gave the formula for computing airspeed from ground and wind speeds, which is a key step for this specific problem. This missing piece was supplemented by internal knowledge of relative velocity. Overall, RAG context was highly relevant for the core concept but incomplete for the specific calculation steps required."
