The relevant formula for equilibrium glide velocity is given by:\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S) \\cos{\\theta}}{\\rho_\\infty C_L}}$$\nFirst, we need to determine the glide angle $\\theta$. The maximum lift-to-drag ratio $(L/D)_{max}$ is given as 10. For an equilibrium glide, the glide angle $\\theta$ is related to the lift-to-drag ratio by:\n$$\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{L/D}$$\nSubstituting $(L/D)_{max} = 10$:\n$$\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\nFrom this, $\\theta = \\arctan(0.1) \\approx 5.71^{\\circ}$. Since this is a small angle, we can approximate $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$. (Alternatively, $\\cos(5.71^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.995$, which is very close to 1 and often used in such problems for simplification, as noted in the RAG context).\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the glide velocity formula:\n- Wing loading ($W/S$) = $500 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n- Air density ($\\rho_\\infty$) = $0.9 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n- Lift coefficient ($C_L$) = $0.69$\n- $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$\n\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 500 \\text{ N/m}^2 \\times 1}{0.9 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.69}}$$\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{1000}{0.621}}$$\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{1610.305958}$$\n$$V_\\infty \\approx 40.1286 \\text{ m/s}$$\nRounding to two decimal places, $V_\\infty \\approx 40.13 \\text{ m/s}$.
