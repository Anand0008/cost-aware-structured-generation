The key is to use the relationship between Young's Modulus (E), Bulk Modulus (K), and Poisson's Ratio ($\\nu$), which is $E = 3K(1 - 2\\nu)$.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Bulk Modulus (K) from the given hydrostatic pressure and volumetric strain. The hydrostatic pressure $p = 100 \\text{ N/mm}^2$. The cube shrinks by 0.05%, which means the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_v = -0.05\\% = -0.0005$. The negative sign indicates a decrease in volume.\n\nThe Bulk Modulus (K) is defined as the ratio of hydrostatic pressure to volumetric strain. For compressive pressure, the formula is $K = -p / \\epsilon_v$. \nSubstituting the given values:\n$K = -100 \\text{ N/mm}^2 / (-0.0005) = 200,000 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\nSince $1 \\text{ GPa} = 1000 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, we have $K = 200 \\text{ GPa}$.\n\nNow, we use the relationship $E = 3K(1 - 2\\nu)$. We are given $E = 300 \\text{ GPa}$ and we calculated $K = 200 \\text{ GPa}$.\n$300 \\text{ GPa} = 3 \\times (200 \\text{ GPa}) \\times (1 - 2\\nu)$\n$300 = 600 \\times (1 - 2\\nu)$\nDivide both sides by 600:\n$0.5 = 1 - 2\\nu$\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\nu$:\n$2\\nu = 1 - 0.5$\n$2\\nu = 0.5$\n$\\nu = 0.5 / 2$\n$\\nu = 0.25$\n\nThe calculated Poisson's ratio of 0.25 is within the typical physical range for most engineering materials ($0 \\le \\nu \\le 0.5$), confirming the correctness of the answer."

The derivations and physical intuitions in the chunks directly supported the solution and explanation. The video URLs were mostly accurate, with one minor discrepancy noted for Prof. Anup Ghosh's lecture where the URL in RAG pointed to a different professor's video."
