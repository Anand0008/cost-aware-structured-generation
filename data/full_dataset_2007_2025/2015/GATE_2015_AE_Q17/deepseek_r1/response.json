        "reasoning": "According to thin airfoil theory, for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the aerodynamic center (AC) is fixed at the quarter-chord point (c/4). The moment about the AC is constant and independent of the angle of attack (and hence lift). Therefore, the AC does not shift with a change in lift. For a cambered airfoil, the center of pressure (CP) is the point where the total aerodynamic force acts. Its location depends on the lift coefficient: $x_{CP} / c = 0.25 - C_{m,c/4} / C_l$. Since $C_{m,c/4}$ is a constant (non-zero for cambered airfoils) and $C_l$ changes with angle of attack, $x_{CP}$ must shift. The RAG context (Chunks 1-5) explicitly states the AC is fixed at c/4 and the CP moves for cambered airfoils, confirming option B."

(ii) The pitching moment about the aerodynamic center, $C_{m,ac}$, is constant (independent of angle of attack $\\alpha$ and lift coefficient $C_l$). Therefore, the AC is a fixed point and does not shift.",
          "Step 3: Understand the behavior of the center of pressure for a cambered airfoil. The CP location is given by $x_{CP}/c = x_{ac}/c - C_{m,ac}/C_l$. Since $C_{m,ac}$ is a non-zero constant for a cambered airfoil, the ratio $C_{m,ac}/C_l$ changes as $C_l$ changes (due to change in $\\alpha$). Consequently, $x_{CP}$ must shift along the chord.",
          "Step 4: Apply the reasoning to the question stem. 'A change in lift' implies a change in $C_l$ (via change in $\\alpha$ at constant velocity/density). This leads to a shift in the CP location but no shift in the AC location.",
          "Step 5: Match the conclusion to the options. Option B states 'a shift of the center of pressure and no shift of the aerodynamic center,' which matches our analysis."

These chunks explicitly support the correct answer. Chunk 6 discussed induced drag for finite wings, which was less directly relevant but provided context for 'large aspect ratio.'"
