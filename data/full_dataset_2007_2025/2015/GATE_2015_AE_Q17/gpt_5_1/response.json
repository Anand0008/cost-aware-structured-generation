        "reasoning": "For a thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered) at small angles of attack, thin airfoil theory states that the aerodynamic center (AC) is fixed at the quarter-chord, x = c/4, and the pitching moment coefficient about this point is independent of angle of attack. Hence, when lift changes (due to a change in angle of attack), the AC does not move. However, for a cambered airfoil the moment about the leading edge (or any other reference except AC) depends on lift, so the location where the net aerodynamic force can be considered to act with zero moment (the center of pressure, CP) must shift along the chord as lift changes. Mathematically, for a cambered airfoil, the quarter-chord moment coefficient \\(C_{m,c/4}\\) is a constant non-zero value, while the lift coefficient \\(C_l\\) varies with angle of attack as \\(C_l = 2\\pi (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})\\). The CP location is given by \\(x_{CP}/c = 0.25 - C_{m,c/4}/C_l\\). Since \\(C_{m,c/4}\\) is constant and \\(C_l\\) changes with angle of attack (and hence with lift), \\(x_{CP}\\) must change. Therefore, a change in lift leads to a shift of the center of pressure but no shift of the aerodynamic center. This matches option B."

          "Step 6: Since C_{m,c/4} is constant but C_l changes when lift changes, the ratio C_{m,c/4}/C_l changes, so x_{CP}/c must change. Thus, the center of pressure moves with lift, while the aerodynamic center remains fixed at c/4.",
