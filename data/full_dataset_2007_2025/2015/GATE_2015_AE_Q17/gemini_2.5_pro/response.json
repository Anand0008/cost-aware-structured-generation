        "reasoning": "The question pertains to the behavior of the aerodynamic center (AC) and center of pressure (CP) for a thin cambered airfoil section when lift changes. According to thin airfoil theory, for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the aerodynamic center is fixed at the quarter-chord point ($c/4$). This is defined as the point about which the pitching moment coefficient ($C_{m,ac}$) is constant and independent of the angle of attack (and thus, independent of lift). For a cambered airfoil, $C_{m,ac}$ is generally non-zero. The center of pressure (CP), on the other hand, is the point where the resultant aerodynamic force acts, producing zero pitching moment. Its location is given by $x_{CP}/c = 0.25 - C_{m,c/4} / C_l$. Since for a cambered airfoil, $C_{m,c/4}$ is a non-zero constant and $C_l$ (lift coefficient) changes with angle of attack (and thus with lift), the ratio $C_{m,c/4} / C_l$ will change. Consequently, the location of the center of pressure ($x_{CP}$) will shift as the lift changes. Therefore, a change in lift leads to a shift of the center of pressure and no shift of the aerodynamic center."

          "Step 5: Consider the effect of a 'change in lift'. A change in lift implies a change in the lift coefficient ($C_l$). Since $C_{m,c/4}$ is constant and non-zero for a cambered airfoil, a change in $C_l$ will directly cause a change in the term $C_{m,c/4} / C_l$.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the effect on AC and CP. Because $C_{m,ac}$ is constant and independent of lift, the aerodynamic center does not shift. Because $C_l$ changes and $C_{m,c/4}$ is non-zero, the center of pressure shifts."
