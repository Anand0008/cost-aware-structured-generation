        "reasoning": "A rocket nozzle designed to produce maximum thrust at a specific altitude (H = 8 km) implies that at this design altitude, the nozzle exit pressure ($P_e$) is precisely equal to the ambient atmospheric pressure ($P_a$). This is the condition for optimum expansion, which maximizes the pressure thrust term in the thrust equation. As the rocket ascends to altitudes `H > 8 km`, the ambient atmospheric pressure ($P_a$) decreases (as per standard atmospheric models). Since the nozzle's exit pressure ($P_e$) is fixed by its geometry and chamber conditions (and was designed to match the higher $P_a$ at 8 km), at `H > 8 km`, the fixed $P_e$ will be greater than the now lower ambient pressure ($P_a$). The condition $P_e > P_a$ defines an **under-expanded nozzle**. In this state, the exhaust gases exit the nozzle at a pressure higher than the surrounding atmosphere and continue to expand outside the nozzle. Conversely, for `H < 8 km`, the ambient pressure ($P_a$) would be higher than at 8 km. Thus, $P_e < P_a$, leading to an over-expanded condition. Options C (sonic exit condition) and D (unchoked condition) are incorrect because a properly functioning rocket nozzle always operates with supersonic flow at the exit (after the throat) and is choked at the throat to achieve high thrust."

Sonic exit condition (Option C) is incorrect as flow is supersonic at the exit of a C-D nozzle. Unchoked condition (Option D) is incorrect as rocket nozzles are designed to be choked at the throat."
