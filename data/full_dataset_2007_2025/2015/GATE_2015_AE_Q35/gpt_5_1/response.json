        "reasoning": "A nozzle designed for maximum thrust at a specific altitude is optimally expanded there, i.e., exit pressure equals ambient pressure: $p_e = p_a$ at $H = 8\\,\\text{km}$. From the RAG and standard nozzle theory, optimum condition is $p_e = p_a$. Above this altitude, ambient pressure decreases, but the nozzle geometry (and thus its design exit pressure) is fixed. Therefore, for $H > 8\\,\\text{km}$, $p_a$ is lower than the design $p_e$, so $p_e > p_a$: this is an under-expanded jet. Option A states exactly this. Option B reverses the condition (incorrect). Options C and D talk about sonic/unchoked exit, which are unrelated to altitude in a fixed-geometry rocket nozzle operating from a high chamber pressure; the exit remains supersonic and choked at the throat, not sonic at exit or unchoked at lower altitude. Hence A is correct."

          "Step 3: The nozzle geometry is fixed, so its design exit pressure $p_e$ (for given chamber conditions) is fixed. At $H > 8\\,\\text{km}$, we therefore have $p_e > p_a$.",
          "Step 4: By definition, if $p_e > p_a$, the jet is under-expanded (it could expand further outside the nozzle). If $p_e < p_a$, it would be over-expanded.",

These matched the question perfectly and reinforced the reasoning that a nozzle designed for a given altitude becomes under-expanded at higher altitudes. No significant gaps were present; internal knowledge was consistent with RAG."
