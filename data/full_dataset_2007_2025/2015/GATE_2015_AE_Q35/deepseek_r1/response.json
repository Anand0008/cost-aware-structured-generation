        "reasoning": "The nozzle is designed for maximum thrust at H = 8 km, meaning it is optimally expanded at that altitude: exit pressure equals ambient pressure ($P_e = P_a$). For altitudes above 8 km, ambient pressure $P_a$ decreases below the design value. Since the nozzle geometry and chamber conditions are fixed, the exit pressure $P_e$ remains essentially constant (determined by nozzle area ratio and chamber pressure). Therefore, for H > 8 km, $P_e > P_a$, which is the condition for an under-expanded nozzle."

          "Step 1: Understand the design condition. A nozzle designed for maximum thrust at a specific altitude (H = 8 km) is optimally expanded at that altitude. This means the static pressure of the exhaust gases at the nozzle exit ($P_e$) exactly matches the ambient atmospheric pressure ($P_a$) at that altitude: $P_{e,design} = P_{a,design}$.",
          "Step 2: Recall how ambient pressure varies with altitude. Atmospheric pressure decreases monotonically with increasing altitude. Therefore, at altitudes above the design point (H > 8 km), $P_a$ is lower than $P_{a,design}$. At altitudes below the design point (H < 8 km), $P_a$ is higher than $P_{a,design}$.",
          "Step 3: Analyze off-design operation. For a fixed-geometry rocket nozzle operating with constant chamber conditions, the exit pressure $P_e$ is approximately fixed (determined by the nozzle's expansion ratio). It does not change significantly with external ambient pressure.",
          "Step 4: Compare $P_e$ and $P_a$ at different altitudes. At H > 8 km: $P_e$ (fixed) > $P_a$ (lower). This is the definition of an under-expanded condition. At H < 8 km: $P_e$ (fixed) < $P_a$ (higher). This is the definition of an over-expanded condition.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the options. Option A states 'under-expanded condition for H > 8 km', which matches our analysis. Option B states the opposite and is incorrect. Option C (sonic exit) is incorrect because a properly designed rocket nozzle has supersonic flow at the exit. Option D (unchoked condition) is incorrect because the throat remains choked (sonic) for a wide range of back pressures in a CD nozzle."
