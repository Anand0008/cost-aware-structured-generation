At altitudes above 8 km, the ambient pressure decreases, and the nozzle will operate in an under-expanded condition, as the nozzle exit pressure (P_e) will be greater than the ambient pressure (P_a). This is because the nozzle is designed for a higher pressure at 8 km, and as the altitude increases, the ambient pressure decreases, leading to an under-expanded condition. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
