As explained in the retrieved knowledge, deploying a trailing edge flap shifts the lift coefficient vs. angle of attack (C_l-α) curve upwards, increasing the maximum lift coefficient and reducing the stall velocity. This allows the aircraft to generate more lift at lower speeds, which is crucial for takeoff and landing performance. The other options (A, C, and D) are secondary effects of flaps, but not their primary purpose."
