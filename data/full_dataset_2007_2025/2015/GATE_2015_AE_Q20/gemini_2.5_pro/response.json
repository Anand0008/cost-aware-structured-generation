        "reasoning": "Trailing edge flaps are classified as high-lift devices. Their primary function is to increase the effective camber of the airfoil. This increase in camber shifts the lift coefficient versus angle of attack (`$C_L - \\alpha$`) curve upwards, leading to a higher lift coefficient at any given angle of attack and, crucially, a higher maximum lift coefficient (`$C_{L,max}$`). A higher `$C_{L,max}$` allows the aircraft to generate sufficient lift at lower airspeeds, thereby reducing the stall speed. This is essential for safe takeoff and landing operations, enabling shorter runway requirements and lower approach speeds. The retrieved knowledge consistently supports this, stating that flaps increase both lift and drag coefficients, with the primary aim of increasing `$C_{L,max}$`."

          "Step 2: Recall the general category of devices to which trailing edge flaps belong: high-lift devices.",
          "Step 3: Understand the primary aerodynamic mechanism of trailing edge flaps. They increase the camber of the wing. Some types, like Fowler flaps, also increase the wing's effective surface area.",
          "Step 4: Relate the increase in camber (and potentially area) to the lift characteristics of an airfoil. An increase in camber leads to a higher lift coefficient at a given angle of attack and shifts the entire lift curve upwards.",
          "Step 5: Conclude the ultimate effect on the maximum lift coefficient. The primary consequence of these changes is a significant increase in the maximum lift coefficient (`$C_{L,max}$`), which is the peak lift coefficient an airfoil can achieve before stalling.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding:",
          "   - Option A (avoid flow separation): While some flap designs (e.g., slotted flaps) help delay separation by re-energizing the boundary layer, the fundamental goal is lift augmentation, not merely separation avoidance. Leading-edge devices are more directly focused on delaying separation at the leading edge.",
          "   - Option B (increase `$C_{L,max}$`): This directly aligns with the primary aerodynamic effect of increasing camber and is the fundamental purpose of trailing edge flaps, as confirmed by multiple sources.",
          "   - Option C (reduce wave drag): Wave drag is a compressible flow phenomenon occurring at high (transonic/supersonic) speeds. Flaps are used at low speeds (takeoff/landing) where compressibility effects are negligible, and they actually increase total drag.",
          "   - Option D (reduce induced drag): Induced drag is associated with lift generation. While flaps increase `$C_L$`, they generally increase total drag, and their primary purpose is not to reduce induced drag. In fact, by increasing `$C_L$`, they might increase induced drag at a given speed."
