        "reasoning": "The primary purpose of a trailing-edge flap is to increase the maximum lift coefficient (C_l,max). This is a standard definition in aerodynamics and is explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 4, and 6). While flaps also increase drag and can affect flow separation, their fundamental design goal is to augment lift for take-off and landing, thereby reducing stall speed and required runway length. Option A (avoid flow separation) is a function of leading-edge devices like slats. Option C (reduce wave drag) is related to supersonic aerodynamics. Option D (reduce induced drag) is achieved by wingtip devices or high aspect ratio."

          "Step 3: Determine the key benefit. By increasing camber and sometimes area, the maximum achievable lift coefficient (C_l,max) is increased. This allows the aircraft to generate the required lift at a lower airspeed, reducing stall speed.",
          "Step 4: Compare with other options. Flow separation delay (A) is primarily a function of leading-edge devices like slats or leading-edge flaps. Wave drag reduction (C) is achieved through airfoil shaping for transonic/supersonic flight. Induced drag reduction (D) is achieved by increasing aspect ratio or using winglets.",
