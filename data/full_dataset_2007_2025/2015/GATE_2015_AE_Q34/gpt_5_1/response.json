Turbines and nozzles operate with favorable pressure gradients, so they generally have higher efficiencies than diffusers and compressors. Thus the usual ordering is \\(\\eta_c < \\eta_i < \\eta_t < \\eta_n\\), which matches option D. This is consistent with the RAG chunks (1,3,6) and standard propulsion references (Ganesan, Hill & Peterson)."

          "Step 3: Understand pressure-gradient effects: intake and compressor work with adverse pressure gradients (pressure rising along flow), which promotes boundary-layer separation and losses; turbine and nozzle have favorable pressure gradients (pressure dropping), which helps maintain attached flow and higher efficiency.",
