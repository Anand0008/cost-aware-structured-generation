The key points are:\n- Compressors have lower efficiencies (0.82-0.88) due to adverse pressure gradients and complex flow phenomena.\n- Intakes have slightly higher efficiencies (0.85-0.95) as they experience a favorable pressure gradient.\n- Turbines have higher efficiencies (0.88-0.92) than compressors due to the favorable pressure gradient.\n- Nozzles have the highest efficiencies (0.95-0.98) as they also experience a favorable pressure gradient and have relatively simple flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: eta_c < eta_i < eta_t < eta_n."
