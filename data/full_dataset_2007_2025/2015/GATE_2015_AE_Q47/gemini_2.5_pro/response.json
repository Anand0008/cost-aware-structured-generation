        "reasoning": "The question asks for the 'indicated airspeed'. While the strict definition of indicated airspeed (IAS) uses standard sea level density, in many GATE problems, when a local freestream density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$) is provided along with total ($p_0$) and static ($p_{\\infty}$) pressures, 'indicated airspeed' is interpreted as the velocity calculated using the incompressible Bernoulli equation with the *given local freestream density*. Following this interpretation:\n1. Calculate the dynamic pressure: $q = p_0 - p_{\\infty} = 54051 - 45565 = 8486 \\text{ N/m}^2$.\n2. Apply the incompressible velocity formula using the given freestream density: $V_{indicated} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q}{\\rho_{\\infty}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 8486}{0.6417}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16972}{0.6417}} = \\sqrt{26449.90} \\approx 162.63 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThis value matches option B (162.6 m/s). Although the flow is compressible (Mach number $\\approx 0.515$), the question specifically asks for 'indicated airspeed', which is fundamentally derived from an incompressible flow assumption, and the provided options strongly suggest using the local density for the calculation."
