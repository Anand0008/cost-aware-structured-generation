        "reasoning": "Directional static stability is quantified mainly by the derivative C_n_\\beta. The vertical tail provides a stabilizing contribution because a sideslip produces a side force on the tail, which, acting at a distance l_v behind the CG, creates a restoring yawing moment. From the RAG (Chunks 2, 4, 5), the vertical tail lever arm l_v (or L_v) is the distance from the tail aerodynamic center to the aircraft CG, and the tail contribution to C_n_\\beta is proportional to (dC_Y_v/d\\beta) (l_v/b) (S_v/S_ref). Moving the vertical tail rearward increases l_v, hence increases the stabilizing yawing moment for a given side force, improving directional static stability. Therefore the assertion that moving the vertical tail rearward improves directional static stability is true. The reason correctly states that moving the tail rearward increases the moment arm from the tail AC to the CG, which is exactly why the stabilizing moment increases. Thus both [a] and [r] are true, and [r] is the correct explanation of [a]."
