The directional static stability of an aircraft is primarily governed by the vertical tail's contribution to the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip, $C_{n_\\beta}$. This contribution is proportional to the vertical tail volume ratio, $V_{vt} = \\frac{l_{vt} S_{vt}}{b S}$, where $l_{vt}$ is the moment arm from the aircraft's CG to the aerodynamic center of the vertical tail. Moving the vertical tail rearward increases $l_{vt}$, which directly increases $V_{vt}$. A larger $V_{vt}$ results in a more positive (stabilizing) $C_{n_\\beta}$, thereby improving directional static stability. The reason correctly identifies the mechanism: increasing the moment arm amplifies the restoring yawing moment generated by the vertical tail's side force for a given sideslip angle."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the core concept. Directional static stability requires a positive yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle, i.e., $C_{n_\\beta} > 0$. A positive $C_{n_\\beta}$ means a sideslip (e.g., wind from the right, $\\beta > 0$) generates a yawing moment that turns the nose into the wind (to the right), restoring the aircraft to zero sideslip.",
          "Step 2: Identify the primary component responsible. The vertical tail (vertical stabilizer) is the main contributor to positive $C_{n_\\beta}$. When sideslip occurs, the vertical tail acts like a vertical wing, generating a side force. This force, acting at a distance (the moment arm, $l_{vt}$) behind the CG, creates the restoring yawing moment.",
          "Step 3: Examine the governing parameter. The effectiveness of the vertical tail is quantified by the vertical tail volume ratio, $V_{vt} = \\frac{l_{vt} S_{vt}}{b S}$. For a given vertical tail area ($S_{vt}$), wingspan ($b$), and wing area ($S$), the stabilizing contribution is directly proportional to the moment arm $l_{vt}$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the change. 'Moving the vertical tail rearward' increases the distance $l_{vt}$ between the tail's aerodynamic center and the aircraft's CG, as stated in reason [r]. This increases $V_{vt}$ and thus the magnitude of the positive $C_{n_\\beta}$ contribution from the vertical tail, improving overall directional static stability.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the link. The assertion [a] is true (directional stability improves). The reason [r] is true and correctly identifies the physical mechanism (increased moment arm) that causes the improvement. Therefore, [r] is the correct reason for [a]."
