The reason [r] that this is because it increases the moment arm from the tail aerodynamic center to the aircraft center of gravity is also correct. As explained in the retrieved knowledge, the vertical tail generates a side force that creates a yawing moment about the aircraft's center of gravity. By increasing the moment arm (distance from CG to vertical tail AC), the magnitude of this yawing moment is increased, thereby improving the aircraft's directional static stability."
