        "reasoning": "Both the assertion [a] and the reason [r] are true, and [r] correctly explains [a].\\n\\n**Assertion [a]: Aircraft directional static stability can be improved by moving the vertical tail rearward.**\\nThis assertion is TRUE. Directional static stability is primarily provided by the vertical tail. As explained in RAG Chunks 2 and 5, the vertical tail generates a side force when the aircraft experiences sideslip, creating a yawing moment that restores the aircraft to zero sideslip. The magnitude of this restoring yawing moment is directly proportional to the moment arm of the vertical tail from the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). Increasing this moment arm enhances the effectiveness of the vertical tail in generating a restoring moment, thus improving directional static stability.\\n\\n**Reason [r]: Moving the vertical tail rearward increases the moment arm from the tail aerodynamic center to the aircraft center of gravity.**\\nThis reason is TRUE. The moment arm (`$L_v$` or `$\\l_{vt}$`) is defined as the distance between the vertical tail's aerodynamic center (AC) and the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) (RAG Chunks 2 and 4). If the vertical tail is moved further aft (rearward) while the aircraft's CG remains relatively fixed, the distance between the tail's AC and the CG will increase. This is a direct geometric consequence.\\n\\n**Relationship between [a] and [r]:**\\nReason [r] is the correct explanation for assertion [a]. The increase in the moment arm (`$L_v$`) due to moving the vertical tail rearward directly leads to an increase in the vertical tail's contribution to the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip (`$C_{n_\\beta}$`). As shown in RAG Chunk 5, `$(C_{n_\\beta})_{vertical\\_tail}$` is proportional to `$\\l_v$`. A larger positive `$(C_{n_\\beta})$` signifies greater directional static stability. Therefore, increasing the moment arm by moving the tail rearward directly improves directional static stability."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of directional static stability. It refers to an aircraft's tendency to return to its original heading after being disturbed by a sideslip (yaw disturbance). For positive directional static stability, the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip, `C_n_beta`, must be positive.",
          "Step 2: Identify the primary component responsible for directional static stability. The vertical tail (vertical stabilizer) is the main contributor to directional static stability (RAG Chunks 2 and 5).",
          "Step 3: Recall how the vertical tail generates a restoring moment. When an aircraft sideslips, the relative wind strikes the vertical tail, generating a side force. This side force, acting at a distance (moment arm) from the aircraft's center of gravity (CG), creates a yawing moment (RAG Chunk 2).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of the moment arm. The magnitude of the yawing moment generated by the vertical tail is directly proportional to the length of its moment arm (`$L_v$` or `$\\l_{vt}$`), which is the distance from the vertical tail's aerodynamic center to the aircraft's CG (RAG Chunks 2, 4, 5).",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Assertion [a]. If the vertical tail is moved rearward, its moment arm from the CG increases. A larger moment arm means that for the same side force, a greater restoring yawing moment will be generated, thus improving directional static stability. So, Assertion [a] is true.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Reason [r]. Moving the vertical tail rearward inherently increases the physical distance between its aerodynamic center and the aircraft's center of gravity, assuming the CG location remains constant. So, Reason [r] is true.",
          "Step 7: Determine if [r] is the correct reason for [a]. Since the improvement in directional stability (Assertion [a]) is directly caused by the increased moment arm (Reason [r]) leading to a larger restoring yawing moment, Reason [r] is indeed the correct explanation for Assertion [a]."
