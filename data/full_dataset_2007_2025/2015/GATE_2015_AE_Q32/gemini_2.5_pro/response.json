          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. The flow is described as one-dimensional, steady, and isentropic. For such a flow, the conservation of energy is expressed by the stagnation enthalpy equation.",

          "Step 3: Interpret the given information. The initial specific stagnation enthalpy is given as $h_0$. The gas expands to a state where its velocity is $u$. The phrase 'new specific stagnation enthalpy of $h_0/2$' is interpreted as the specific *static enthalpy* ($h$) at this new state, for the problem to be solvable and consistent with typical compressible flow problems. So, $h = h_0/2$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the given values into the stagnation enthalpy equation. Using the initial stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ (which remains constant for an adiabatic flow) and the interpreted static enthalpy $h = h_0/2$ at velocity $u$, the equation becomes: $h_0 = \\left(\\frac{h_0}{2}\\right) + \\frac{u^2}{2}$.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate the kinetic energy term. Subtract $h_0/2$ from both sides: $h_0 - \\frac{h_0}{2} = \\frac{u^2}{2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{h_0}{2} = \\frac{u^2}{2}$.",
          "Step 6: Solve for the desired ratio $u^2/h_0$. From $\\frac{h_0}{2} = \\frac{u^2}{2}$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get $h_0 = u^2$. Dividing by $h_0$ (assuming $h_0 \\neq 0$), we get $\\frac{u^2}{h_0} = 1$."
