In two dimensions, a rotation by an angle $\\theta$ is represented by $\\mathbf{R}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}$. Here, $a = \\cos\\theta$ and $b = \\sin\\theta$, so the condition $a^2 + b^2 = \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$ is automatically satisfied. Multiplying a position vector by this matrix transforms it to a new vector obtained by rotating the original vector about the origin by angle $\\theta$, with no change in magnitude (since $\\det(\\mathbf{R}) = 1$) and no added translation. Therefore, the operation is a pure rotation."
