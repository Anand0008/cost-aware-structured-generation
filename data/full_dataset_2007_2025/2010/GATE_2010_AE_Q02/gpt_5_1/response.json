A 2D linear transformation represented by matrix A = [[a, -b],[b, a]] has determinant det(A) = a^2 + b^2 = 1 and preserves vector length: ||V2||^2 = (a^2 + b^2)(x1^2 + y1^2) = ||V1||^2. A linear map that preserves lengths and has determinant +1 is a pure rotation (no reflection, no scaling). There is no translation term (no added constant vector), and magnification (scaling) is absent because the norm is unchanged. Therefore the transformation is a rotation of the position vector about the origin."
