          "Step 2: Recall the First Shifting Theorem (or s-shifting property) for Laplace transforms. The theorem states that if `L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s)`, then `L\\{e^{at} f(t)\\} = F(s-a)`.",
          "Step 3: Use the given `L\\{e^{-t} f(t)\\} = F(s+1)` to determine the expression for `F(s)`. Since `e^{-t} = e^{(-1)t}`, we have `a = -1`. Thus, `F(s - (-1)) = F(s+1) = 2s / ((s+1)^2 + 4)`. To find `F(s)`, replace `(s+1)` with `s` in the expression. This implies replacing `s` in the numerator with `(s-1)`. So, `F(s) = 2(s-1) / (s^2 + 4)`.",

For `a=2`, `L\\{2 \\cos 2t - \\sin 2t\\} = 2(s / (s^2 + 2^2)) - (2 / (s^2 + 2^2)) = (2s - 2) / (s^2 + 4) = 2(s-1) / (s^2 + 4)`. This confirms our `F(s)`.",
          "Step 5: Apply the First Shifting Theorem again to find `L\\{e^t f(t)\\} = F(s-1)`. Here, `a=1`. Substitute `(s-1)` for `s` in the expression for `F(s)` derived in Step 3.",

While the exact forward shifting theorem formula was not explicitly stated in a single chunk, the inverse form was, and the underlying principle was well-covered, allowing the model to confidently apply its knowledge."
