The fundamental principle governing such systems is the generalized Newton's Second Law, which states that the net external force on a system is equal to the rate of change of its momentum, accounting for mass entering or leaving the system.\n\nThe generalized Newton's Second Law for a variable mass system is given by:\n$$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = F_{ext} + v_{rel} \\frac{dm}{dt}$$\nWhere:\n*   `$m$` is the instantaneous mass of the spacecraft.\n*   `$\\frac{dv}{dt}$` is the acceleration of the spacecraft.\n*   `$F_{ext}$` is the net external force acting on the spacecraft.

The relative velocity of the incoming dust with respect to the spacecraft is:\n`$v_{rel} = v_{dust} - v_{spacecraft} = 0 - v = -v$`\n\nSubstitute these values into the generalized Newton's Second Law:\n`$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = 0 + (-v) \\frac{dm}{dt}$`\n`$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = -v \\frac{dm}{dt}$`\n\nNow, solve for the acceleration `$\\frac{dv}{dt}$`:\n`$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - \\frac{v}{m} \\frac{dm}{dt}$`\n\nPlug in the given numerical values:\n`$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}}{100 \\text{ kg}} \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s})$`\n`$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - (180 \\text{ m/kg}) \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s})$`\n`$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - 576 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m/s}^2$`\n`$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the spacecraft is decelerating.

          "**Step 1: Identify the physical principle.** The problem involves a spacecraft whose mass is changing (picking up dust). This falls under the category of variable mass systems. The governing principle is the generalized form of Newton's Second Law, which accounts for momentum changes due to mass flow.",
          "**Step 2: Write down the governing equation.** The generalized Newton's Second Law for a variable mass system is: `$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = F_{ext} + v_{rel} \\frac{dm}{dt}$`. Here, `$m$` is the instantaneous mass, `$\\frac{dv}{dt}$` is the acceleration, `$F_{ext}$` is the net external force, `$v_{rel}$` is the velocity of the added/ejected mass relative to the main body, and `$\\frac{dm}{dt}$` is the rate of mass change.",
          "**Step 3: Apply problem-specific conditions.**\n    *   Given spacecraft mass, `$m = 100 \\text{ kg}$`.\n    *   Given spacecraft speed, `$v = 1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}$`.\n    *   Given rate of dust accretion, `$\\frac{dm}{dt} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s}$`. Since mass is being added, `$\\frac{dm}{dt}$` is positive.\n    *   The dust is initially at rest, so its absolute velocity is `$v_{dust} = 0 \\text{ m/s}$`.\n    *   No external forces are mentioned, so `$F_{ext} = 0$`.",
          "**Step 4: Determine the relative velocity (`$v_{rel}$`).** The velocity of the incoming dust relative to the spacecraft is `$v_{rel} = v_{dust} - v_{spacecraft}$`. Substituting the values, `$v_{rel} = 0 - v = -v$`. So, `$v_{rel} = -1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}$`.",
          "**Step 5: Substitute all terms into the governing equation.**\n    `$100 \\text{ kg} \\times \\frac{dv}{dt} = 0 + (-1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s})$`\n    `$100 \\frac{dv}{dt} = - (1.8 \\times 10^4 \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\text{ N}$`",

Therefore, Retardation `= |\\frac{dv}{dt}| = 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2`. This value is closest to `5.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2`."
