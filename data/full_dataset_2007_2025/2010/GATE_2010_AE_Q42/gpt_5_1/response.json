        "reasoning": "Both stages have the same specific impulse and the same payload and structural ratios. The second-stage mass breakdown is: propellant 10208 kg, structure 1134 kg, payload 1700 kg. For stage 2, initial mass is sum of all three: m_{02} = 10208 + 1134 + 1700 = 13042 kg, final mass after burning its propellant is m_{f2} = 1134 + 1700 = 2834 kg. The payload ratio for each stage is \\lambda = m_L / m_0 = 1700 / 13042, and the structural ratio is \\epsilon = m_s / (m_s + m_p) = 1134 / (1134 + 10208). Because the problem states these ratios are the same for both stages, the first stage has the same mass fractions and hence the same mass ratio R = m_0 / m_f. For stage 2, R_2 = m_{02} / m_{f2} = 13042 / 2834 \\approx 4.602. With identical ratios, R_1 = R_2 = R. The ideal velocity increment for each stage in a drag-free, zero-gravity field is given by Tsiolkovsky's equation: \\Delta V_i = g_e I_{sp} \\ln R. Total burnout velocity is the sum: V_f = g_e I_{sp} (\\ln R_1 + \\ln R_2) = g_e I_{sp} \\ln(R_1 R_2) = g_e I_{sp} \\ln(R^2) = 2 g_e I_{sp} \\ln R. Using g_e = 9.8\\,\\text{m/s}^2 and I_{sp} = 300\\,\\text{s}, c = g_e I_{sp} = 9.8 \\times 300 = 2940\\,\\text{m/s}. Then \\ln R = \\ln(13042 / 2834) \\approx \\ln(4.602) \\approx 1.526.

For identical stages with the same R, the overall ratio is R^2, so you can write $V_f = c \\ln(R^2)$ directly, then use $\\ln(R^2) = 2 \\ln R$ to simplify.",
