        "reasoning": "The rod is hinged at the top and free at the bottom. A uniform temperature increase causes thermal expansion. Since the rod is free to expand axially (the hinge fixes the top point but allows the bottom to move down), there is no constraint to induce internal forces. In thermoelasticity, the total strain is the sum of mechanical (elastic) strain and thermal strain. When free to expand, mechanical strain is zero (no stress), and thermal strain ($\\alpha \\Delta T$) is a dimensional change not associated with stress. The question likely interprets 'strain' as mechanical strain (elastic strain), so the rod experiences neither stress nor mechanical strain. Hence, option D is correct per the official answer key."

          "Step 2: Identify boundary conditions. The hinge at the top typically prevents translation (fixed point) but allows rotation. The bottom end is free. Thus, the rod can expand axially downward without any restraint.",
          "Step 3: Recall thermoelastic principles. A uniform temperature change $\\Delta T$ causes a thermal strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{thermal}} = \\alpha \\Delta T$, where $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion. If the rod is free to expand, this thermal strain does not produce stress. Stress arises only when expansion is constrained.",
          "Step 4: Distinguish between total strain and mechanical strain. Total strain = mechanical strain (related to stress via Hooke's law) + thermal strain. For a free expansion, mechanical strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{mech}} = 0$ (since $\\sigma = 0$), while thermal strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{thermal}} \\neq 0$.",
          "Step 5: Interpret the question's terminology. In many engineering contexts, 'strain' in such multiple-choice questions refers to mechanical strain (elastic strain), not the total dimensional change. Thus, with no constraint, there is no mechanical strain and no stress.",
          "Step 6: Conclude. The rod undergoes thermal expansion (dimensional change) but has zero stress and zero mechanical strain. Therefore, it has neither stress nor strain (as per the question's likely meaning). Option D is correct."
