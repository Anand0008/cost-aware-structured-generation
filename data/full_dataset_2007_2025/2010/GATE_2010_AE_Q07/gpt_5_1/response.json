        "reasoning": "Uniform temperature rise causes a free, unconstrained body to undergo uniform thermal expansion. Thermal strain is given by $\\epsilon_T = \\alpha \\Delta T$. However, this strain only produces stress if expansion is restrained. Here, the slender rod is suspended by a hinge at the top and hangs freely; the hinge does not prevent axial expansion, it only provides a pin support for rotation and vertical reaction but no axial constraint. Gravity is neglected, so there is no self-weight tension. With no axial restraint and no other loads, the rod can expand freely: it experiences no internal stress. The key subtlety is that the question asks about the state *after* heating to a uniform temperature. A uniform temperature change in an unconstrained bar produces a uniform change in length but no internal stress; in classical linear thermoelasticity, we treat this as zero mechanical strain and zero stress, because the thermal strain is a stress-free strain. Thus, in the sense of stress-producing (mechanical) strain, the rod has neither stress nor (mechanical) strain. This matches option D."
