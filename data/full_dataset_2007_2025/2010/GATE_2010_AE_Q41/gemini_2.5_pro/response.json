The steady flow energy equation for an ideal gas relates stagnation temperature ($T_0$), static temperature ($T$), and flow velocity ($V$) through the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$). First, $c_p$ is calculated from the given $R$ and $c_v$ using Mayer's relation ($c_p = c_v + R$). Then, the flow velocity $V$ is determined from the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and cross-sectional area $A$ ($V = Q/A$). Finally, these values are substituted into the energy equation ($c_p T + V^2/2 = c_p T_0$) to solve for $T$. The calculated value of $T \\approx 350.05 K$ matches option B."
