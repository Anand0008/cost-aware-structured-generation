Using h = c_p T and h_0 = c_p T_0, we get V^2/2 = c_p (T_0 - T). The volumetric flow rate Q = 680 m^3/s through area A = 1 m^2 gives velocity V = Q/A = 680 m/s. For air, c_p = c_v + R = 718 + 287 = 1005 J/kg-K. Substituting into the energy equation: T_0 - T = V^2 / (2 c_p) = 680^2 / (2 × 1005) ≈ 230.1 K. Thus T = T_0 - 230.1 ≈ 580.05 - 230.1 ≈ 349.95 K ≈ 350 K, which corresponds to option B. This matches the official key."
