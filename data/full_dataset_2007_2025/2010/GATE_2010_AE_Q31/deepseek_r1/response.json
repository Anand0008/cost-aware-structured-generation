          "Step 2: Write the shear flow formula for a section symmetric about x-axis with vertical shear force Sy through shear center. Since Ixy = 0 and Sx = 0, the shear flow simplifies to: $q_s = -\\frac{S_y}{I_{xx}} \\int_0^s t y \\, ds$, where integration starts from a free edge (q=0).",

          "Step 4: Integrate shear flow along each segment to find the shear force in that segment. For example, the horizontal force in a flange: $F_f = \\int_0^b q(s) \\, ds$. The forces in the two flanges form a couple.",
          "Step 5: Take moments about a convenient point (e.g., centroid of the web) to determine the shear center location e.
