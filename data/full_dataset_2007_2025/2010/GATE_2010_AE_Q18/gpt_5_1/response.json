Mathematically, this is where dp/ds = 0 and d^2p/ds^2 > 0. The given pressure distribution is p(s) = 2 + sin(\\pi/2 + s). Using the identity sin(\\pi/2 + s) = cos s, we rewrite p(s) = 2 + cos s. Then dp/ds = -sin s. Setting dp/ds = 0 gives sin s = 0 \\Rightarrow s = n\\pi, n = 0,1,2,... Within the given options, the relevant candidates are s = 0 and s = \\pi. To distinguish between a maximum and a minimum, compute d^2p/ds^2 = -cos s. At s = 0: d^2p/ds^2 = -1 < 0, so p has a local maximum (favorable-to-adverse transition occurs downstream). At s = \\pi: d^2p/ds^2 = -cos \\pi = 1 > 0, so p has a local minimum. The separation point is associated with the pressure minimum where the adverse pressure gradient begins downstream, i.e., at s = \\pi m. Among the options, this corresponds to option D."

For laminar flow, the separation point is typically at the first pressure minimum (start of adverse pressure gradient).",

From the leading edge, the flow initially experiences a favorable pressure gradient (dp/ds < 0) up to the pressure minimum, then an adverse pressure gradient (dp/ds > 0) downstream.
