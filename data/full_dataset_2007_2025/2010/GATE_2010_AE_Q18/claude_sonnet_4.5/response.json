The flow will separate when the pressure gradient becomes adverse, i.e., when the pressure increases in the direction of the flow. This occurs when the derivative of the pressure with respect to s is positive. Differentiating the pressure expression, we get: dp/ds = π/2 * cos(π/2 + s). This expression is positive when s = π, which corresponds to option D."
