        "reasoning": "Flow separation in viscous flow over a curved surface typically occurs where the pressure gradient changes from favorable to adverse, i.e., where dp/ds = 0 and changes sign. Given p(s) = 2 + sin(π/2 + s) = 2 + cos(s), the pressure gradient is dp/ds = -sin(s). Setting dp/ds = 0 gives sin(s) = 0, so s = nπ for integer n. The first non-zero point after the leading edge is s = π m, where the pressure is minimum (cos(π) = -1) and the gradient changes from negative (favorable for s < π) to positive (adverse for s > π). This matches the separation criterion. Options A, B, and C do not satisfy dp/ds = 0 with sign change; at these points, the gradient is either favorable or adverse but not at the transition."
