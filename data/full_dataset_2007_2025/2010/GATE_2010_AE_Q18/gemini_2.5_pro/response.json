Mathematically, this is characterized by the wall shear stress becoming zero. In problems where only the pressure distribution $p(s)$ is given, the onset of separation is typically identified at the point where the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{ds}$ transitions from favorable (negative) to adverse (positive), or where $\\frac{dp}{ds} = 0$ and subsequently becomes positive.\n\nGiven the pressure distribution: $p(s) = 2 + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + s) \\text{ N/m}^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the pressure distribution.**\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + s) = \\cos(s)$, the pressure distribution simplifies to:\n$$p(s) = 2 + \\cos(s) \\text{ N/m}^2$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pressure gradient.**\nTo find the pressure gradient, we differentiate $p(s)$ with respect to $s$:\n$$\\frac{dp}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}(2 + \\cos(s)) = -\\sin(s)$$\n\n**Step 3: Identify the condition for flow separation.**\nFlow separation is caused by an adverse pressure gradient, which means the pressure increases in the direction of flow, i.e., $\\frac{dp}{ds} > 0$.\n\n*   A favorable pressure gradient is $\\frac{dp}{ds} < 0$, which implies $-\\sin(s) < 0 \\implies \\sin(s) > 0$.
