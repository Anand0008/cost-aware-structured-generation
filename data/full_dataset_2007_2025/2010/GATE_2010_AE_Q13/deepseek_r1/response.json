Substituting Y = 200 MPa and σ_x = 150 MPa yields a quadratic equation in σ_y. Solving gives σ_y ≈ 227 MPa and σ_y ≈ -77 MPa. The question asks for the maximum uniform tensile stress, so the positive value (227 MPa) is correct."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the yield criterion and stress state. The plate is isotropic and follows the Von Mises (Distortion Energy) criterion. The yield strength under uniaxial tension is Y = 200 MPa. The loading is biaxial tension: σ_x = 150 MPa (given), σ_y = ? (to find), and no shear stress (τ_xy = 0). This is a plane stress condition.",
          "Step 2: Write the Von Mises yield criterion for plane stress without shear. The general form for plane stress is: σ_x^2 - σ_x σ_y + σ_y^2 + 3τ_xy^2 = Y^2. Since τ_xy = 0, this simplifies to: σ_x^2 - σ_x σ_y + σ_y^2 = Y^2.",
          "Step 3: Substitute the known values. Y = 200 MPa, σ_x = 150 MPa. So, (150)^2 - (150)(σ_y) + (σ_y)^2 = (200)^2. This becomes: 22500 - 150σ_y + σ_y^2 = 40000.",
          "Step 4: Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation. σ_y^2 - 150σ_y + 22500 - 40000 = 0 → σ_y^2 - 150σ_y - 17500 = 0.",
          "Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula: σ_y = [150 ± √(150^2 + 4*17500)] / 2 = [150 ± √(22500 + 70000)] / 2 = [150 ± √92500] / 2.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the numerical values. √92500 ≈ 304.138. So, σ_y ≈ (150 + 304.138)/2 ≈ 227.069 MPa and σ_y ≈ (150 - 304.138)/2 ≈ -77.069 MPa.",
          "Step 7: Interpret the solutions. The question asks for the maximum uniform tensile stress along the y-direction. Tensile stress is positive, so we select σ_y ≈ 227 MPa. The negative value represents compressive stress, which is not asked for."

The RAG context sufficiently supported solving the problem without needing internal knowledge beyond basic algebra."
