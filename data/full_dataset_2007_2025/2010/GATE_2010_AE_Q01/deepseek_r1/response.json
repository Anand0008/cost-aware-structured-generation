For a diffuser, the inlet is ambient static condition 'a' and exit is stagnation condition '02'. The ideal isentropic temperature rise to achieve the actual exit pressure P_02 is (T_02s - T_a), while the actual temperature rise is (T_02 - T_a). Thus, η_d = (T_02s - T_a)/(T_02 - T_a). This matches option A. Options C and D involve pressure differences, which are typically used for pressure recovery coefficient, not isentropic efficiency. Option B has incorrect addition signs."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of a subsonic diffuser. It decelerates incoming air, converting kinetic energy into pressure rise (stagnation pressure increase). The process is adiabatic (no heat transfer), so stagnation enthalpy (and thus stagnation temperature for constant Cp) is conserved: T_02 = T_0a = T_a + V_a^2/(2C_p).",
          "Step 2: Recall the general definition of isentropic efficiency for a work-absorbing device (like a compressor or diffuser). It compares the ideal work input (or temperature rise) to the actual work input for the same pressure ratio.",
          "Step 3: For a diffuser, the ideal (isentropic) process from the same inlet (ambient static, P_a, T_a) to the same exit pressure (P_02) would result in an exit temperature T_02s, given by the isentropic relation: T_02s/T_a = (P_02/P_a)^((\\gamma-1)/\\gamma).",
          "Step 4: The actual process from inlet to exit yields actual exit stagnation temperature T_02 (which is higher than T_a due to kinetic energy conversion).",
          "Step 5: The isentropic efficiency is the ratio of the ideal temperature rise to the actual temperature rise: η_d = (ideal ΔT) / (actual ΔT) = (T_02s - T_a) / (T_02 - T_a). This is exactly option A.",
          "Step 6: Eliminate other options: B uses addition, which is physically meaningless. C and D use pressure differences; while pressure recovery is important, the isentropic efficiency of a diffuser is defined via temperature rise (work input analogy), not directly as a pressure ratio. Pressure-based definitions are used for pressure recovery coefficient, which is different."
