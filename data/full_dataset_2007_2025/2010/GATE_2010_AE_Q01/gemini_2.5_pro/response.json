        "reasoning": "The isentropic efficiency ($\\eta$) for a work-consuming device (like a compressor) or a flow-compressing/diffusing device (like a diffuser) is generally defined as the ratio of the ideal (isentropic) change in a property to the actual change in that property. Specifically, it is the ratio of the ideal work input to the actual work input, or ideal temperature rise to actual temperature rise.\n\nFor a diffuser, the process involves increasing the pressure and temperature of the incoming air. Let's denote:\n*   `T_a`: Ambient static temperature (inlet static condition).\n*   `T_02`: Actual stagnation temperature at the diffuser exit.\n*   `T_02s`: Stagnation temperature at the diffuser exit if the process from ambient static conditions (`T_a`, `P_a`) to the actual exit stagnation pressure (`P_02`) were isentropic.\n\nThe ideal temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `(T_02s - T_a)`.\nThe actual temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `(T_02 - T_a)`.\n\nDue to irreversibilities (friction, turbulence) in a real diffuser, the actual process requires more 'effort' (or results in a higher temperature for a given pressure ratio) than the ideal isentropic process. Therefore, for the same pressure ratio, the actual temperature rise `(T_02 - T_a)` will be greater than the ideal temperature rise `(T_02s - T_a)`.\n\nThus, the isentropic efficiency of a diffuser is given by:\n`$\\eta_d = \\frac{\\text{Ideal Temperature Rise}}{\\text{Actual Temperature Rise}} = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_a}{T_{02} - T_a}$`\n\nThis definition ensures that `$\\eta_d < 1$` for a real diffuser, as the numerator will be smaller than the denominator. This aligns with the definition of compressor isentropic efficiency provided in RAG Chunk 5: `$\\eta_C = (T_{t3s} - T_{t2}) / (T_{t3} - T_{t2})$`.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B uses addition instead of subtraction. Options C and D are pressure-based, but their formulation as differences is not the standard definition for diffuser efficiency (which is typically a ratio of stagnation pressure recoveries, e.g., `$\\eta_d = P_{02} / P_{02s}$` or `$\\eta_d = (P_{02}/P_a) / (P_{02s}/P_a)$`)."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of isentropic efficiency. Isentropic efficiency compares the actual performance of a component to its ideal (isentropic, reversible, and adiabatic) performance.",
          "Step 2: Recall the general definition of isentropic efficiency for work-consuming or flow-compressing devices. For such devices, efficiency is typically defined as the ratio of the ideal (isentropic) change in a property (like temperature or work) to the actual change in that property. (Refer to RAG Chunk 2 and 5).",
          "Step 3: Identify the relevant temperatures for a diffuser. 'a' represents ambient static conditions (inlet), '2' represents the actual stagnation conditions at the diffuser exit, and 's' denotes an isentropic process. Thus, `T_a` is ambient static temperature, `T_02` is actual exit stagnation temperature, and `T_02s` is ideal (isentropic) exit stagnation temperature.",
          "Step 4: Formulate the ideal and actual temperature rises. The ideal temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `$(T_{02s} - T_a)$`. The actual temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `$(T_{02} - T_a)$`.",
          "Step 5: Apply the efficiency definition. Since a diffuser is a flow-compressing device, its efficiency is `$\\eta_d = \\frac{\\text{Ideal Temperature Rise}}{\\text{Actual Temperature Rise}}$`.",
