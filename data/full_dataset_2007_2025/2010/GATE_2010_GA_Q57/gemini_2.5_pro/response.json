        "reasoning": "The relationship between 'Unemployed' and 'Worker' is that an 'Unemployed' person is a 'Worker' who is currently not performing their primary function (working). Similarly, 'fallow' describes 'land' that is currently not performing its primary function (cultivation). Both pairs represent a state of inactivity or non-utilization for the primary purpose of the second word in the pair. Let's analyze other options:\nB. 'unaware : sleeper': While a sleeper is often unaware, 'unaware' is a general state, not a specific condition of a sleeper not performing its function. A sleeper's function is to sleep, and being unaware is a characteristic of that state, not a lack of it.\nC. 'wit : jester': 'Wit' is a characteristic or quality of a 'jester', not a state of non-performance.\nD. 'renovated : house': A 'renovated' house is a house that has been improved. This describes a state resulting from an action, not a state of non-utilization of its primary function. Therefore, option A is the best match."

          "Step 1: Identify the precise relationship between the given pair of words, 'Unemployed : Worker'. An 'Unemployed' person is a 'Worker' who is currently not engaged in their primary function or occupation.",
          "Step 2: Articulate this relationship clearly: The first word describes a state of the second word, specifically a state of non-performance or non-utilization of its primary purpose.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'fallow : land'. 'Fallow' land is land that is left uncultivated for a period to restore its fertility. This means the land is not performing its primary function (cultivation). This relationship perfectly matches the original pair.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: 'unaware : sleeper'. A 'sleeper' is a person who is sleeping. While a sleeper is typically 'unaware', 'unaware' is a general characteristic or consequence of sleeping, not a state of a sleeper *not* sleeping or *not* performing their function. The relationship is not analogous.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'wit : jester'. 'Wit' is a quality or characteristic possessed by a 'jester'. This is a 'characteristic of' relationship, which is different from the 'state of non-performance' relationship of the original pair.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: 'renovated : house'. A 'renovated' house is a house that has been improved or repaired. This describes a state of the house after an action has been performed on it, implying a change or improvement, not a state of non-utilization of its primary function. The relationship is not analogous.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that Option A best expresses the same relationship as 'Unemployed : Worker'."
