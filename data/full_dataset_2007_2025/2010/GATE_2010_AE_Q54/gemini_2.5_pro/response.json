It is characterized by a long period and light damping, involving a slow exchange of kinetic and potential energy, leading to coupled oscillations in speed and altitude. For an aircraft in straight and level flight at a constant speed 'V', the approximate time period 'T' of the phugoid oscillation is given by the formula: \\(T = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\pi V}{g}\\). Comparing this formula with the given options:\n\nA. \\(v / (\\pi g)\\)\nB. \\(\\pi v / g\\)\nC. \\(v / (\\sqrt{2} \\pi g)\\)\nD. \\(\\sqrt{2} \\pi v / g\\)\n\nOption D directly matches the standard approximate formula for the phugoid oscillation time period. The RAG context provided general information about 'g' and turn mechanics but did not contain the specific formula for phugoid oscillation, thus internal knowledge was used for the core formula."
