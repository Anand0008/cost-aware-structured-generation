This is a special case of a Hermitian matrix, which is defined as $A = A^*$ where $A^*$ is the conjugate transpose. For real matrices, the conjugate transpose is simply the transpose, so a real symmetric matrix is Hermitian. A fundamental theorem states that all eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real numbers. Therefore, the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are always real. This is supported by multiple RAG chunks (e.g., Chunk 2, 4, 6)."
