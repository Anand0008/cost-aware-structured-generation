        "reasoning": "A real symmetric matrix is a matrix where all its entries are real numbers and it is equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$). This type of matrix is a special case of a Hermitian matrix. A Hermitian matrix is defined as a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose ($A = A^*$). For a real matrix, the conjugate transpose $A^*$ simplifies to the transpose $A^T$ (since the conjugate of a real number is itself). Therefore, if a matrix is real and symmetric ($A = A^T$), it automatically satisfies the condition for being Hermitian ($A = A^*$). A fundamental property of Hermitian matrices is that all their eigenvalues are real numbers. This property is derived from the definition of eigenvalues and the conjugate transpose operation. Consequently, since real symmetric matrices are Hermitian, their eigenvalues must always be real."
