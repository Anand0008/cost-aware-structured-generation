It then asks to find the time taken by a team with 2 skilled, 6 semi-skilled, and 5 unskilled workers to build the wall. \n\nTo solve this, we can use the concept of 'work done' being inversely proportional to the time taken. The total work done by the team is the sum of the work done by each worker type. \n\nLet the time taken be t days.\nWork done by 2 skilled workers in t days = 2 * (1/20) = 0.1 walls\nWork done by 6 semi-skilled workers in t days = 6 * (1/25) = 0.24 walls \nWork done by 5 unskilled workers in t days = 5 * (1/30) = 0.167 walls\nTotal work done = 0.1 + 0.24 + 0.167 = 0.507 walls\n\nSince the team builds 1 wall, the time taken is:\nt = 1 / 0.507 = 15 days\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 15 days."
