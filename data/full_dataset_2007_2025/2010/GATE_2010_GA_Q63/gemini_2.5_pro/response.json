        "reasoning": "To solve this work-rate problem, we first determine the individual work rate of each type of worker. The work rate is defined as the amount of work done per unit of time (in this case, per day).\n\n1.  **Calculate the work rate of one skilled worker:**\n    5 skilled workers build a wall in 20 days.\n    Total work done by 5 skilled workers in 1 day = $1/20$ of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 skilled worker in 1 day = $\\frac{1}{5 \\times 20} = \\frac{1}{100}$ of a wall.\n\n2.  **Calculate the work rate of one semi-skilled worker:**\n    8 semi-skilled workers build a wall in 25 days.\n    Total work done by 8 semi-skilled workers in 1 day = $1/25$ of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 semi-skilled worker in 1 day = $\\frac{1}{8 \\times 25} = \\frac{1}{200}$ of a wall.\n\n3.  **Calculate the work rate of one unskilled worker:**\n    10 unskilled workers build a wall in 30 days.\n    Total work done by 10 unskilled workers in 1 day = $1/30$ of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 unskilled worker in 1 day = $\\frac{1}{10 \\times 30} = \\frac{1}{300}$ of a wall.\n\n4.  **Calculate the combined work rate of the team:**\n    The team consists of 2 skilled, 6 semi-skilled, and 5 unskilled workers.\n    Work rate of 2 skilled workers = $2 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{1}{50}$ of a wall per day.\n    Work rate of 6 semi-skilled workers = $6 \\times \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{6}{200} = \\frac{3}{100}$ of a wall per day.\n    Work rate of 5 unskilled workers = $5 \\times \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{5}{300} = \\frac{1}{60}$ of a wall per day.\n\n    Total work rate of the team = $\\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{3}{100} + \\frac{1}{60}$ wall per day.\n\n    To sum these fractions, find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 50, 100, and 60. The LCM is 300.\n    Total work rate = $\\frac{6}{300} + \\frac{9}{300} + \\frac{5}{300} = \\frac{6 + 9 + 5}{300} = \\frac{20}{300} = \\frac{1}{15}$ of a wall per day.\n\n5.  **Calculate the time taken to build the wall:**\n    If the team builds $1/15$ of a wall per day, then the time taken to build 1 full wall is the reciprocal of the total work rate.\n    Time = $\\frac{1}{\\text{Total Work Rate}} = \\frac{1}{1/15} = 15$ days.\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 days for the team to build the wall, which corresponds to option D."
