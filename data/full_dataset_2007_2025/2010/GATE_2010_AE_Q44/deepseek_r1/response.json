However, the given question uses a specific linear form Cm_cg = (0.05 - 0.2δ_e) - 0.1 C_L, which is a simplified version where the angle of attack dependence is rolled into the C_L term. The RAG chunks did not contain this exact form but provided the underlying principles. Thus, while relevant for concepts, direct formula mapping was not possible; internal knowledge was used to solve from first principles (setting Cm=0)."
