        "reasoning": "Based on the fundamental principles of oblique shock waves, when a supersonic flow crosses an oblique shock, the velocity vector is resolved into components normal and tangential to the shock front. The normal component of velocity (perpendicular to the shock, $V_n$) decreases as it passes through the shock, similar to a normal shock, leading to compression and an increase in pressure, density, and temperature. The tangential component of velocity (parallel to the shock, $V_t$) remains unchanged across the shock due to the absence of shear forces parallel to the shock in an inviscid flow model. Therefore, option D accurately describes these changes."

          "Step 3: Apply conservation laws across the shock for the tangential component. In an inviscid flow, there are no shear stresses acting parallel to the shock wave. Consequently, the tangential component of momentum, and thus velocity, is conserved across the shock. This means $V_{t1} = V_{t2}$.",
          "Step 4: Apply conservation laws across the shock for the normal component. The normal component of velocity behaves exactly like the velocity across a normal shock. For a normal shock, the velocity always decreases from supersonic to subsonic. Therefore, the normal component of velocity decreases across the oblique shock: $V_{n2} < V_{n1}$.",
          "Step 5: Combine these observations. The normal component of velocity decreases, while the tangential component of velocity remains unchanged. Compare this conclusion with the given options to identify the correct statement."
