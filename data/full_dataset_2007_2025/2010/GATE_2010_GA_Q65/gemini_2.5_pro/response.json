          "**Step 2: Interpret the age difference condition.** \"The age difference between any two successive siblings is less than 3 years.\" Since there are no twins, the minimum age difference is 1 year. Thus, the age difference between directly successive siblings must be either 1 or 2 years ($A_i - A_{i+1} \\in \\{1, 2\\}$).",
          "**Step 3: Apply conditions related to Gita and Saira (ii & iii).**\n    *   \"The age difference between Gita and Saira is 1 year.\" This means G and S must be adjacent in the birth order.\n    *   \"Gita is not the oldest and Saira is not the youngest.\" This implies G cannot be $A_1$ and S cannot be $A_4$. Combined with G and S being adjacent, this eliminates several possibilities (e.g., G cannot be $A_1$ if S is $A_2$; S cannot be $A_4$ if G is $A_3$).",

G is $A_2$ (not oldest), S is $A_3$ (not youngest). **Possible.**\n    *   **D. IHSG:** S and G are adjacent. G is $A_4$ (not oldest), S is $A_3$ (not youngest). **Possible.**",
