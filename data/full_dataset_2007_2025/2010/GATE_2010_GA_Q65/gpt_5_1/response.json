        "reasoning": "Let the ages (in years) of Hari, Gita, Irfan and Saira be H, G, I, S. All are distinct integers (no twins), and the age gap between any two successive siblings in birth order is 1 or 2 years (less than 3). Condition (ii): |G − S| = 1, G is not oldest, S is not youngest. Condition (i): H + G > I + S. We must find a birth order (oldest to youngest) consistent with these. Test the options as birth orders:\nOption B: SGHI means S is oldest, then G, then H, then I. Let ages be S = x, G = x − d1, H = x − d1 − d2, I = x − d1 − d2 − d3 with d1, d2, d3 ∈ {1,2}. Since S is oldest, S > G > H > I. Age difference between successive siblings is 1 or 2, so this is feasible. Now |G − S| = 1 implies S − G = 1, so d1 = 1. Thus S = x, G = x − 1. G is not oldest (true, S is older), S is not youngest (true, S is oldest). Now check condition (i): H + G > I + S. Substitute: H = x − 1 − d2, I = x − 1 − d2 − d3. Then H + G = (x − 1 − d2) + (x − 1) = 2x − 2 − d2. I + S = (x − 1 − d2 − d3) + x = 2x − 1 − d2 − d3. Inequality H + G > I + S becomes 2x − 2 − d2 > 2x − 1 − d2 − d3 ⇒ −2 > −1 − d3 ⇒ adding 2: 0 > 1 − d3 ⇒ d3 > 1. Since d3 ∈ {1,2}, we must have d3 = 2, which is allowed. So there exist valid age gaps (e.g., d1 = 1, d2 = 1, d3 = 2) satisfying all constraints. Hence SGHI is consistent.\nCheck other options quickly:\nA: HSIG (H oldest, then S, I, G). Here G is youngest, violating 'Saira is not the youngest'. So A invalid.\nC: IGSH (I oldest, then G, S, H). Here G and S are consecutive in birth order, so |G − S| is 1 or 2. But we also need H + G > I + S. Write ages with I oldest: I = x, G = x − d1, S = x − d1 − d2, H = x − d1 − d2 − d3. |G − S| = d2 = 1 (given). So d2 = 1. Check H + G > I + S: (x − d1 − 1 − d3) + (x − d1) > x + (x − d1 − 1) ⇒ 2x − 2d1 − 1 − d3 > 2x − d1 − 1 ⇒ −2d1 − 1 − d3 > −d1 − 1 ⇒ −d1 − d3 > 0 ⇒ impossible since d1, d3 > 0. So C invalid.\nD: IHSG (I oldest, then H, S, G). Again G and S consecutive, |G − S| = 1 or 2, and G is youngest (violating 'Gita is not the oldest' is okay, but 'Saira is not the youngest' is okay since G is youngest). However, we must have |G − S| = 1. Let I = x, H = x − d1, S = x − d1 − d2, G = x − d1 − d2 − d3. |G − S| = d3 = 1. Check H + G > I + S: (x − d1) + (x − d1 − d2 − 1) > x + (x − d1 − d2) ⇒ 2x − 2d1 − d2 − 1 > 2x − d1 − d2 ⇒ −2d1 − d2 − 1 > −d1 − d2 ⇒ −d1 − 1 > 0 ⇒ impossible. So D invalid. Thus only option B (SGHI) satisfies all conditions, matching the official key."

The age difference between Gita and Saira is 1 year. However, Gita is not the oldest and Saira is not the youngest. iii. There are no twins. In what order were they born (oldest first)?"
