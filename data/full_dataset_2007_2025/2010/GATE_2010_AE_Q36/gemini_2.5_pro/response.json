        "reasoning": "The static margin ($K_n$) of an aircraft is fundamentally defined as the negative of the derivative of the pitching moment coefficient ($C_{m_{cg}}$) with respect to the lift coefficient ($C_L$), assuming a stick-fixed condition. Mathematically, this is expressed as $K_n = -\\frac{\\partial C_{m_{cg}}}{\\partial C_L}$.\n\nThe given equation for the pitching moment coefficient is $C_{m_{cg}} = (0.05 - 0.2 \\delta_e) - 0.1 C_L$.\n\nTo find the static margin, we need to differentiate $C_{m_{cg}}$ with respect to $C_L$. In this differentiation, terms that do not explicitly contain $C_L$ (such as $0.05$ and $-0.2 \\delta_e$) are treated as constants.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial C_{m_{cg}}}{\\partial C_L} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C_L} [(0.05 - 0.2 \\delta_e) - 0.1 C_L]$\n\nPerforming the differentiation:\n$\\frac{\\partial C_{m_{cg}}}{\\partial C_L} = 0 - 0 - 0.1 = -0.1$\n\nNow, substitute this value into the definition of static margin:\n$K_n = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_{m_{cg}}}{\\partial C_L}\\right) = -(-0.1) = 0.1$\n\nAlternatively, the general form of the pitching moment equation can be written as $C_{m_{cg}} = C_{m_0} - K_n C_L + C_{m_{\\delta_e}} \\delta_e$, where $K_n$ is the static margin. Rearranging the given equation to match this form:\n$C_{m_{cg}} = 0.05 - 0.1 C_L - 0.2 \\delta_e$\n\nComparing the coefficient of $C_L$ in both equations, we have $-K_n = -0.1$, which directly implies $K_n = 0.1$. Both methods yield the same result, confirming that the static margin of the aircraft is $0.1$."
