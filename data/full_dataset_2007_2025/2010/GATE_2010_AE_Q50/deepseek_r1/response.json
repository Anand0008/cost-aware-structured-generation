This is verified by deriving velocity components from the given stream function for potential flow over a spinning cylinder. The radial velocity Vr is zero on the cylinder surface (r=R) due to the impermeability condition. The azimuthal velocity V_theta is computed as V_theta = -2 * V_inf * sin(theta) - Gamma/(2πR). Substituting V_inf = 25 m/s, R = 1 m, Gamma = 50π m²/s, and theta = π/2 (sinθ=1) yields V_theta = -2*25*1 - (50π)/(2π*1) = -50 - 25 = -75 m/s.

Therefore, internal knowledge was primarily used for the superposition with vortex and the specific derivation with circulation."
