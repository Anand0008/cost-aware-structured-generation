          "Step 1: Recall that a necessary condition for an interior local extremum (maximum or minimum) of a function $f(x, y)$ is that its first-order partial derivatives vanish at that point: $f_x = 0$ and $f_y = 0$ (Chunks 1, 5, 6).",

          "Step 4: Set up the system of equations for critical points: $f_x = 0 \\implies 2x - y = 0$ and $f_y = 0 \\implies 2y - x - 3 = 0$.",
          "Step 5: Solve the system. From the first equation, $y = 2x$. Substitute into the second: $2(2x) - x - 3 = 0 \\implies 4x - x - 3 = 0 \\implies 3x = 3 \\implies x = 1$. Then $y = 2(1) = 2$. The critical point is $(1, 2)$.",
          "Step 6: Verify that $(1, 2)$ is indeed an extremum and not a saddle point using the second derivative test (not strictly required by the question but good practice). Compute second derivatives: $f_{xx} = 2$, $f_{yy} = 2$, $f_{xy} = -1$. The discriminant $D = f_{xx} f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = (2)(2) - (-1)^2 = 4 - 1 = 3$. Since $D > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$, the point $(1, 2)$ is a local minimum (Chunk 4 concept).",
