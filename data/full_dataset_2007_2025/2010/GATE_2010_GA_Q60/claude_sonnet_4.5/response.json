The total number of persons playing either hockey or football is 15 + 17 - 10 = 22, since the 10 persons playing both sports are counted only once.\n2. The number of persons playing neither hockey nor football is the total number of persons (25) minus the number of persons playing either hockey or football (22), which gives 25 - 22 = 3.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 3 persons are playing neither hockey nor football."
