This gives $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the flight path angle (climb angle). Load factor is defined as $n = L/W$. Therefore, $n = \\cos(\\gamma)$. For a climb, $\\gamma > 0$. For steep angles, $\\gamma$ is still less than $90^\\circ$, so $\\cos(\\gamma)$ is positive but less than 1. Thus, the load factor is positive but less than 1.0.
