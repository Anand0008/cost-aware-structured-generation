The load factor \\\\(\\\\text{n}\\\\) is defined as the ratio of lift to weight, i.e., \\\\(\\\\text{n} = \\\\text{L} / \\\\text{W}\\\\). Substituting the lift equation, we get \\\\(\\\\text{n} = (\\\\text{W} \\\\cos(\\\\gamma)) / \\\\text{W} = \\\\cos(\\\\gamma)\\\\).

For any \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) such that \\\\(0 < \\\\gamma < 90^{\\\\circ}\\\\), the value of \\\\(\\\\cos(\\\\gamma)\\\\) is positive but less than 1.0.
