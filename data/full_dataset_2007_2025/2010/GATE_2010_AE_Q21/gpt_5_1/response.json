        "reasoning": "For a turbofan (and similarly for a turbojet) at fixed turbine inlet temperature, increasing compressor pressure ratio \\(\\pi_c\\) has competing effects. Initially, as \\(\\pi_c\\) increases from low values, the cycle thermal efficiency improves and the exhaust jet can be expanded from a higher total pressure, so the jet velocity and specific thrust increase. However, higher \\(\\pi_c\\) also means higher compressor work, so the turbine must extract more work, which reduces the stagnation temperature and available energy at the nozzle inlet. Beyond an optimum \\(\\pi_c\\), the extra compressor/turbine work dominates and the available exhaust kinetic energy per unit mass decreases, so specific thrust starts to fall. Standard parametric analysis curves (Hill & Peterson; Ganesan; Mishra lectures in RAG chunks 4–6) show a clear peak in specific thrust vs. compressor pressure ratio at fixed turbine inlet temperature. Therefore, the correct qualitative trend is: specific thrust first increases and then decreases with increasing compressor pressure ratio."

          "Step 3: At the same time, higher \\(\\pi_c\\) requires more compressor work. To supply this, the turbine must extract more work, which increases the turbine temperature drop and lowers the nozzle inlet temperature and thus the available kinetic energy for the jet.",
          "Step 4: For low to moderate \\(\\pi_c\\), the benefit of higher pressure ratio (better expansion and higher jet velocity) outweighs the extra internal work, so specific thrust increases.",
          "Step 5: Beyond an optimum \\(\\pi_c\\), the additional compressor/turbine work reduces the energy left for the jet more than the pressure increase helps, so the exhaust velocity and specific thrust begin to decrease.",

Chunk 2 also covered the effect of compressor pressure ratio at fixed turbine inlet temperature. Although the question is about a turbofan, the core cycle behavior is the same as for a turbojet, so the RAG context was highly relevant and helpful."
