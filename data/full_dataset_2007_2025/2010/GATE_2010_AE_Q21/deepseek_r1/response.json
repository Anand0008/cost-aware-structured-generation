        "reasoning": "For a turbofan engine at constant turbine inlet temperature (TET), increasing the compressor pressure ratio has a non-monotonic effect on specific thrust. Initially, higher pressure ratio improves thermal efficiency and increases specific thrust due to better expansion and pressure thrust. However, beyond an optimum point, the increased compressor work requires more turbine work, reducing the exhaust temperature and velocity, which decreases specific thrust. This behavior is similar to turbojets, as indicated in RAG chunks 2, 4, 5, and 6, where specific thrust versus compressor pressure ratio shows an optimum. Thus, specific thrust first increases and then decreases."
