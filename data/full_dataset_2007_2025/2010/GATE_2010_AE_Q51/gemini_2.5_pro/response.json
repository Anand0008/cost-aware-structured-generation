On the cylinder surface (at $r=R$), the radial velocity $V_r$ is always zero due to the no-penetration boundary condition.",
          "**Step 2: Recall the tangential velocity formula for a spinning cylinder.** The tangential velocity $V_{\\theta}$ on the surface of a cylinder (at $r=R$) in a uniform flow $V_{\\infty}$ with circulation $\\Gamma$ is given by $V_{\\theta} = -2 V_{\\infty} \\sin\\theta - \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi R}$.",
