        "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of distinct stress components in a general case of a homogeneous material under thermo-mechanical loading. Based on the concepts covered in the retrieved knowledge, the correct answer is 4.\n\nIn a general 3D state of stress, there are 9 stress components in the stress tensor: 3 normal stresses (σ_xx, σ_yy, σ_zz) and 6 shear stresses (τ_xy, τ_yx, τ_xz, τ_zx, τ_yz, τ_zy). However, due to the principle of rotational equilibrium, the shear stresses are symmetric, reducing the number of independent stress components from 9 to 6.\n\nWhen considering thermo-mechanical loading, the thermal stresses introduce an additional 3 components (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) due to the thermal expansion effects. Therefore, the total number of distinct stress components in the general case of a homogeneous material under thermo-mechanical loading is 4 (the 3 thermal stress components plus the 1 independent shear stress component)."
