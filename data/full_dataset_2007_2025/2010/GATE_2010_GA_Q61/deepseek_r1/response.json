The passage implies that using chemical agents in this context is a regrettable and negative development. Option C captures this evaluative judgment ('undesirable'). Option A is not the focus.

The author is not endorsing the view that chemical agents are useful; rather, they are lamenting that some people hold this view within a context (silent suppression of civilians) that makes them especially dangerous.",

Options B and D are presented as facts within the passage but are not the author's concluding point.
