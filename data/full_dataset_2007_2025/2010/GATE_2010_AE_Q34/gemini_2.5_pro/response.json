        "notes": "RAG chunks 2, 4, and 6 were highly relevant. Chunk 6 provided direct conceptual and procedural guidance for calculating the gradient and unit normal vector, which is precisely what's needed for finding the direction of the steepest slope. Chunk 2 offered a similar example calculation for directional derivatives, reinforcing the steps for gradient calculation and normalization. Chunk 4 provided foundational understanding of partial derivatives as directional derivatives along axes. The RAG context was very helpful in formulating the solution and explanations."
