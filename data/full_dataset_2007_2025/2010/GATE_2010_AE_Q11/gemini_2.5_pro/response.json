To evaluate such an integral, it must be split into two parts at the point of discontinuity: $\\int_{{-1}}^{{0}} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx + \\int_{{0}}^{{1}} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$. Let's evaluate the first part: $I_1 = \\int_{{-1}}^{{0}} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\lim_{{a \\to 0^-}} \\int_{{-1}}^{{a}} x^{-2} dx$. Performing the integration, we get $[-\\frac{1}{x}]_{-1}^{a}$. Applying the limits: $I_1 = \\lim_{{a \\to 0^-}} \\left( -\\frac{1}{a} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{-1}\\right) \\right) = \\lim_{{a \\to 0^-}} \\left( -\\frac{1}{a} - 1 \\right)$. As $a \\to 0^-$, the term $-1/a$ approaches positive infinity. Therefore, $I_1$ diverges. Since one part of the improper integral diverges, the entire integral diverges and thus does not exist.

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 2, and 5 were highly relevant. Chunk 1 provided a direct example of an improper integral with an interior discontinuity and the method for evaluation, which was directly applicable to the question. Chunks 2 and 5 defined proper integrals, helping to classify the given integral as improper. Chunk 4, while about double integrals, reinforced the general concept of non-existent integrals due to unbounded functions. Chunks 3 and 6 were not relevant to this specific question."
