          "Step 1: Identify the nature of the integral. The integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$ is a definite integral. Check if it is proper: The limits are finite ($-1$ and $1$), but the integrand $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is unbounded (goes to infinity) at $x=0$, which lies inside the interval. Hence, it is an improper integral of Type II (discontinuity within the integration limits).",
          "Step 2: Split the integral at the point of discontinuity. Since the discontinuity is at $x=0$, we write: $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx + \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.",

As $a \\to 0^-$, $-\\frac{1}{a} \\to +\\infty$, so the limit diverges to $+\\infty$.",
