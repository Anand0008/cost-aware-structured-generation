        "reasoning": "The calculation confirms that the stagnation pressure at the nozzle inlet is approximately 2.11 bar. This value is obtained by first determining the stagnation temperature at the nozzle inlet (turbine exit) using the work balance principle for an ideal turbojet (turbine work equals compressor work), and then applying the isentropic relation for pressure and temperature across the ideal turbine. The calculated value matches option C."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. We are given the stagnation pressure at turbine inlet ($P_{03} = 6$ bar), stagnation temperature at turbine inlet ($T_{03} = 1400$ K), change in specific enthalpy across the compressor ($\\Delta h_c = 335$ kJ/kg), specific heat capacity ($C_p = 1117$ J/kgK), and ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma = 1.3$). The objective is to find the stagnation pressure at the nozzle inlet ($P_{04}$).",
          "Step 2: Apply the work balance principle for an ideal turbojet engine. In an ideal turbojet, the work produced by the turbine is entirely consumed by the compressor. Therefore, the change in specific enthalpy across the turbine ($\\Delta h_t$) is equal to the change in specific enthalpy across the compressor ($\\Delta h_c$).",
          "Step 3: Calculate the stagnation temperature at the turbine exit ($T_{04}$). Using the enthalpy balance, $\\Delta h_t = C_p (T_{03} - T_{04}) = \\Delta h_c$. Substitute the known values: $1117 \\text{ J/kgK} \\times (1400 \\text{ K} - T_{04}) = 335 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J/kg}$.",
          "Step 4: Solve for $T_{04}$. From the previous step, $1400 - T_{04} = \\frac{335000}{1117} \\approx 300 \\text{ K}$. Therefore, $T_{04} = 1400 - 300 = 1100 \\text{ K}$.",
          "Step 5: Apply the isentropic relation for an ideal turbine. Since the turbine in an ideal turbojet operates isentropically, the stagnation pressure and temperature are related by: $\\frac{P_{04}}{P_{03}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{04}}{T_{03}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the values and calculate $P_{04}$. We have $P_{03} = 6$ bar, $T_{03} = 1400$ K, $T_{04} = 1100$ K, and $\\gamma = 1.3$. The exponent is $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1.3}{1.3-1} = \\frac{1.3}{0.3} = \\frac{13}{3} \\approx 4.333$. So, $P_{04} = 6 \\text{ bar} \\times \\left(\\frac{1100}{1400}\\right)^{13/3} = 6 \\text{ bar} \\times (0.7857)^{4.333} \\approx 6 \\text{ bar} \\times 0.3517 = 2.1102 \\text{ bar}$.",
          "Step 7: Compare with options. The calculated value $2.1102$ bar is approximately $2.1$ bar, which matches option C."
