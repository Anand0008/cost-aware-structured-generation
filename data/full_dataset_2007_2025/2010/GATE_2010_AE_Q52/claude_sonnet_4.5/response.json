The stagnation pressure at the turbine inlet is given as 6 bar.\n2. The change in specific enthalpy across the compressor is 335 kJ/kg.\n3. Using the isentropic relationship between stagnation pressure and temperature, and the given Cp and gamma values, the stagnation temperature at the turbine inlet can be calculated as 1400 K.\n4. Assuming the fuel flow rate is very small compared to the air flow rate, the stagnation pressure at the nozzle inlet can be calculated using the isentropic relationship between stagnation pressure and temperature from the turbine inlet to the nozzle inlet. This results in a stagnation pressure of 2.1 bar at the nozzle inlet."
