        "reasoning": "Specific impulse (Isp) is a measure of propulsion efficiency. For rockets, Isp is defined as thrust divided by the total propellant mass flow rate (fuel + oxidizer). For air-breathing engines like ramjets, Isp is typically defined based on fuel flow rate only, since oxidizer (air) is taken from the atmosphere. Ramjets have higher Isp because they use atmospheric oxygen and thus require less onboard propellant mass per unit thrust. Typical Isp values: solid rockets ~170-300 s, liquid rockets ~300-450 s, cryogenic rockets (LOX/LH2) ~450 s, while ramjets can achieve Isp of 1000-2000 s or more depending on flight conditions. Therefore, among the given options, ramjet has the maximum specific impulse."

          "Step 3: Compare the Isp ranges. The Isp of ramjets is significantly higher than that of any chemical rocket because ramjets use atmospheric air as oxidizer, leading to much higher efficiency in terms of fuel consumption.",
