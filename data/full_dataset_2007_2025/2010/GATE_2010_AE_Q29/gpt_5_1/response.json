        "reasoning": "For an Airy stress function \\(\\phi(x,y)\\), the plane stress components are \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial y^2\\), \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi / \\partial x^2\\), and \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2 \\phi / (\\partial x \\partial y)\\). The plate is subjected to: (1) uniform shear \\(\\tau_0\\) on all edges, implying a constant shear stress field \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_0\\) everywhere; and (2) uniform uniaxial tension \\(\\sigma_0\\) in the \\(y\\)-direction, implying \\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\) and \\(\\sigma_x = 0\\). We therefore need an Airy function that produces constant \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_0\\), constant \\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\), and zero \\(\\sigma_x\\). \n\n1) Shear part: Take \\(\\phi_s = -\\tau_0 x y\\). Then \\(\\partial \\phi_s / \\partial x = -\\tau_0 y\\), \\(\\partial^2 \\phi_s / \\partial x \\partial y = -\\tau_0\\), so \\(\\tau_{xy} = -(-\\tau_0) = \\tau_0\\) (uniform). Also \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi_s / \\partial y^2 = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi_s / \\partial x^2 = 0\\). Thus the sign in front of \\(\\tau_0 x y\\) must be negative to get positive \\(\\tau_0\\). Options B and D have \\(+\\tau_0 x y\\) and would give \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\tau_0\\), opposite to the applied shear. Options A and C have \\(-\\tau_0 x y\\), so only they can match the given shear direction.\n\n2) Uniaxial tension part: We need \\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\) and \\(\\sigma_x = 0\\). Consider a quadratic term \\(\\phi_t = a x^2\\). Then \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi_t / \\partial x^2 = 2a\\) (constant) and \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi_t / \\partial y^2 = 0\\). Choosing \\(a = \\sigma_0 / 2\\) gives \\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\). Thus the correct tension term is \\(+\\sigma_0 x^2 / 2\\). Option C has \\(+\\sigma_0 x^2/2\\); option A has \\(-\\sigma_0 x^2/2\\), which would give \\(\\sigma_y = -\\sigma_0\\), i.e., compression instead of tension. The higher-order \\(x^4 - y^4\\) terms in A and D would produce non-uniform stresses, contradicting the uniform traction condition. Therefore the only Airy function that yields uniform shear \\(\\tau_0\\) and uniform uniaxial tension \\(\\sigma_0\\) in the \\(y\\)-direction with \\(\\sigma_x = 0\\) is option C: \\(\\phi = -\\tau_0 x y + \\sigma_0 x^2/2\\)."
