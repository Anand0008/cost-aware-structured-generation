Superposing the bending moment diagrams for a central point load (symmetric triangle, peak PL/4) and a central clockwise moment (antisymmetric with jump) yields a piecewise linear diagram: positive throughout, maximum at just left of center (0.3PL), dropping by M at the center to 0.2PL, then decreasing to zero at the right support.
