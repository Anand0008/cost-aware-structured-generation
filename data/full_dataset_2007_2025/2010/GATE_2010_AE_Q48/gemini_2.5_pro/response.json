          "Step 1: Analyze the loading condition. The vertical load `P` is applied at the end of a bracket of length `a = 0.1L` at the center of the beam. This translates into two distinct loads acting on the beam at its center (`x = L/2`): a downward vertical force `P` and a concentrated clockwise moment `M_c = P \\times a = 0.1PL`.",
          "Step 2: Determine the support reactions. Apply equilibrium equations (`\\Sigma F_y = 0` and `\\Sigma M = 0`) to the entire beam. For a simply supported beam with a downward force `P` at `L/2` and a clockwise moment `M_c = 0.1PL` at `L/2`, the reactions are `R_A = 0.4P` (upwards) and `R_B = 0.6P` (upwards).",
          "Step 3: Apply the principle of superposition. Break down the complex loading into simpler cases: (a) a simply supported beam with a point load `P` at `L/2`, and (b) a simply supported beam with a concentrated clockwise moment `M_c = 0.1PL` at `L/2`.",
          "Step 4: Draw the Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) for case (a). For a point load `P` at mid-span, the BMD is a triangle peaking at `PL/4 = 0.25PL` at `L/2`.",
          "Step 5: Draw the BMD for case (b). For a clockwise concentrated moment `M_c` at `L/2`, the BMD will be linear from `0` to `-M_c/2` at `L/2` (left side), then jump by `M_c` to `+M_c/2` at `L/2` (right side), and then linearly decrease to `0` at `L`. So, for `M_c = 0.1PL`, it goes from `0` to `-0.05PL` (left `L/2`), jumps to `+0.05PL` (right `L/2`), and then to `0` at `L`.",
          "Step 6: Superimpose the two BMDs. Add the bending moment values from Step 4 and Step 5 at corresponding points along the beam. This results in a BMD that starts at `0`, increases linearly to `0.2PL` at `L/2` (left), jumps to `0.3PL` at `L/2` (right), and then decreases linearly to `0` at `L`.",
