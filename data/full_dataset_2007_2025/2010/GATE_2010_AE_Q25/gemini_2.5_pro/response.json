        "reasoning": "The question asks for the factor limiting the *maximum operating flow rate* through a centrifugal compressor at a given RPM. According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), compressor choking is the phenomenon that limits the maximum mass flow rate. Choking occurs when the flow at some point within the compressor, typically the diffuser throat (as stated in Chunk 1, 2, 3, 6), reaches sonic velocity (Mach 1). Once this condition is met, no further increase in mass flow rate is possible, regardless of downstream pressure reduction. This defines the right-hand boundary of the compressor performance map. In contrast, surge (Option B) limits the *minimum* stable flow rate (low mass flow instability), and impeller stall (Option A) is a precursor to surge or a performance degradation, not the ultimate limit on maximum flow. Inlet flow distortion (Option D) affects performance and stability but is not the fundamental physical limit on the maximum achievable flow rate due to sonic conditions."

          "Step 2: Recall the operational boundaries of a compressor. Compressor performance maps are typically bounded by two main phenomena: surge and choking.",
          "Step 3: Define 'surge'. Surge is an instability occurring at *low* mass flow rates, characterized by flow reversal and pressure oscillations. It defines the left-hand boundary of the compressor map.",
          "Step 4: Define 'choking'. Choking occurs at *high* mass flow rates when the fluid velocity at the narrowest passage (e.g., diffuser throat) reaches the local speed of sound (Mach 1). At this point, the mass flow rate cannot increase further.",
          "Step 5: Relate definitions to the question. Since the question asks for the *maximum* operating flow rate limit, choking is the relevant phenomenon. The RAG context explicitly mentions the 'choking line' as the 'right-hand boundary' (maximum flow limit) and 'choking of diffuser throat' as the specific location.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the options. Option B (Surge) is incorrect as it limits minimum flow. Option A (Impeller stall) is related to flow separation and can lead to surge, but it's not the direct maximum flow limit. Option D (Inlet flow distortion) degrades performance but isn't the fundamental physical limit on maximum flow. Option C (Choking of diffuser throat) directly matches the definition of the maximum flow limit."
