The question describes a 'fixed-hinged' column, which is a common point of confusion. The correct configuration for $K=2$ is 'fixed-free' (cantilever). The answer key (D) matches the formula for a cantilever. However, there is a significant discrepancy: the question text says 'one end fixed and the other end hinged,' which standard terminology defines as 'fixed-pinned' (not cantilever). The standard answer for fixed-pinned is $K \\approx 0.7$ (option B). Given that the provided official answer is D, we must accept it, but note this as a critical learning point regarding terminology and potential question ambiguity. The RAG context is clear and unanimous on the formulas."
