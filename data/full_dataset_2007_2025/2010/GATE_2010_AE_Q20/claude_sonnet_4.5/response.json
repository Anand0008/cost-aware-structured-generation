In a 2D, steady, fully developed, laminar boundary layer over a flat plate, the streamwise velocity gradient du/dx is much smaller than the wall-normal velocity gradient du/dy. This is because the boundary layer is thin, and the streamwise velocity changes much more rapidly in the wall-normal direction (y) than in the streamwise direction (x). The Blasius solution for the laminar boundary layer on a flat plate shows that the streamwise velocity profile u(y) is a function of the similarity variable η = y/δ, where δ is the boundary layer thickness. The derivative du/dx is small compared to du/dy, which is the dominant velocity gradient in the boundary layer."
