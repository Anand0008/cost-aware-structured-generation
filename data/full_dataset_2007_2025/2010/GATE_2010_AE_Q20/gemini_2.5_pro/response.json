This is a fundamental characteristic of a thin boundary layer, based on Prandtl's boundary layer approximations. The boundary layer thickness `$\\delta$` is much smaller than the characteristic streamwise length `x` (i.e., `$\\delta \\ll x$`). Consequently, the velocity `u` changes much more rapidly in the normal direction `y` (across the thin boundary layer) than it does in the streamwise direction `x` (along the flow). This leads to `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$` being significantly larger than `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$`."

          "Step 3: Consider the characteristic scales for the velocity gradients. The streamwise velocity `u` changes from 0 at the wall to `U_e` (free-stream velocity) at the edge of the boundary layer. Therefore:",

          "Step 6: Compare the magnitudes. Since `$\\delta \\ll x$`, it implies that `$\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\gg \\frac{1}{x}$`. Therefore, `$\\frac{U_e}{\\delta} \\gg \\frac{U_e}{x}$`, which directly leads to `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\gg \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$`."
