This is the essence of boundary-layer theory: the stream-wise length scale L is much larger than the boundary-layer thickness \\(\\delta\\). Hence, a typical scale analysis gives \\(\\partial u/\\partial x \\sim U/L\\) and \\(\\partial u/\\partial y \\sim U/\\delta\\). Since \\(\\delta \\ll L\\), we have \\(U/\\delta \\gg U/L\\), therefore \\(\\left|\\partial u/\\partial y\\right| \\gg \\left|\\partial u/\\partial x\\right|\\).
