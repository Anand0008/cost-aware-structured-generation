        "reasoning": "In boundary layer theory, a fundamental simplifying assumption is that variations in the direction normal to the wall (y) are much more significant than variations along the wall (x). This is because the boundary layer is thin (δ << x), so velocity changes from 0 at the wall to U_e at the edge occur over a very small distance in y, creating a large gradient du/dy. The streamwise velocity u changes gradually with x, so du/dx is relatively small. The RAG chunks (2,3,5) describe the boundary layer thickness δ growing with √x, which inherently implies slow streamwise development. This scaling, ∂/∂y >> ∂/∂x, is the cornerstone of Prandtl's boundary layer equations, simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, du/dy >> du/dx is correct."

          "Step 3: Apply scaling analysis (order-of-magnitude estimates) central to boundary layer theory. The key is that the length scale for changes in the y-direction is δ (small), while the length scale for changes in the x-direction is L (large, comparable to x).",
          "Step 4: Estimate the velocity gradients. The velocity u changes from 0 to U_e over a distance δ, so du/dy ~ U_e/δ. The velocity u changes along x due to the growing boundary layer, but this change is gradual; du/dx ~ U_e/L. Since δ << L, it follows that U_e/δ >> U_e/L, and therefore du/dy >> du/dx.",
          "Step 5: Connect to the mathematical formulation. This scaling justifies neglecting certain terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, leading to the boundary layer equations where the dominant viscous term is μ(∂²u/∂y²).",
          "Step 6: Eliminate other options. Option A is the opposite of the correct scaling. Option C (equality) is not true for a thin boundary layer. Option D would imply a specific linear relationship which does not hold."
