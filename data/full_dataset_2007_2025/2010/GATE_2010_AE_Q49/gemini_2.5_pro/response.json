        "reasoning": "The problem describes a simply supported beam of length L with a square cross-section of dimension `h x h`. A bracket is welded at its center, carrying a vertical load P. The bracket dimension `a = 0.1L` indicates an eccentric load.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Loading**: The vertical load P, applied at a distance `a` from the beam's centerline at `L/2`, creates two effects on the beam at its center:\n    *   A downward vertical force `P`.\n    *   A clockwise moment `M_c = P \\times a = P \\times 0.1L`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Support Reactions**: Let `R_A` be the reaction at the left support (A) and `R_B` at the right support (B).\n    *   Sum of vertical forces: `$\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B - P = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B = P$`\n    *   Sum of moments about A (taking clockwise as positive): `$\\sum M_A = 0 \\implies R_B \\times L - P \\times (L/2) - (P \\times 0.1L) = 0$`\n        `$R_B \\times L = P \\times (0.5L + 0.1L) = 0.6PL$`\n        `$R_B = 0.6P$`\n    *   Substitute `R_B` into the force equilibrium equation:\n        `$R_A = P - R_B = P - 0.6P = 0.4P$`\n\n3.  **Determine Maximum Shear Force (V_max)**:\n    *   The shear force `V` from A to `L/2` (just before the load) is `$\\text{V}_{AL/2} = R_A = 0.4P$`.\n    *   At `L/2`, there is a downward force `P`. So, the shear force drops by `P`.\n    *   The shear force `V` from `L/2` (just after the load) to B is `$\\text{V}_{L/2B} = 0.4P - P = -0.6P$`.\n    *   The maximum absolute shear force in the beam is `V_{max} = |-0.6P| = 0.6P$`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Maximum Shear Stress ($\\tau_{max}$)**:\n    *   The beam has a square cross-section of dimension `h x h`. Therefore, the cross-sectional area `A = h \\times h = h^2$`.\n    *   For a solid rectangular cross-section, the maximum shear stress occurs at the neutral axis and is given by the formula: `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V_{max}}{A}$` (as per RAG Chunks 4 and 6).\n    *   Substitute the values of `V_{max}` and `A`:\n        `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{0.6P}{h^2}$`\n        `$\\tau_{max} = 1.5 \\times 0.6 \\frac{P}{h^2}$`\n        `$\\tau_{max} = 0.9 \\frac{P}{h^2}$`\n\nThis result matches Option D."
