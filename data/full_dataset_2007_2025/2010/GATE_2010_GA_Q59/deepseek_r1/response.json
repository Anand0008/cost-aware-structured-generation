        "reasoning": "The word 'betrayed' means to reveal or disclose unintentionally or against one's wishes. The sentence context: 'His rather casual remarks...' suggests his remarks, though seemingly offhand, actually 'revealed' or 'exposed' his underlying lack of seriousness. 'Masked' (to conceal) and 'suppressed' (to prevent or stop) contradict the logical flow of the sentence. 'Belied' means to give a false impression of or to contradict, which is also opposite to the intended meaning because casual remarks would not 'contradict' a lack of seriousness; they would align with it. Therefore, 'betrayed' is the most appropriate choice."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the sentence structure and meaning. The sentence suggests a connection between 'casual remarks' and the 'lack of seriousness'. The missing word should describe the action of the remarks upon the lack of seriousness.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the meaning of each option: (A) 'masked' means to hide or conceal. (B) 'belied' means to give a false impression, to show something to be untrue or to contradict. (C) 'betrayed' means to reveal unintentionally, to show signs of, or to be disloyal to. (D) 'suppressed' means to forcibly put an end to or prevent from being expressed.",
          "Step 3: Apply logical reasoning to the context. Casual remarks, by their nature, might be seen as evidence of not taking something seriously. Therefore, they are more likely to 'reveal' or 'show' a lack of seriousness rather than hide it. 'Betrayed' perfectly captures this sense of unintentional revelation.",
          "Step 4: Eliminate incorrect options. 'Masked' and 'suppressed' would imply the remarks hide the lack of seriousness, which is illogical because casualness and lack of seriousness are consistent. 'Belied' would imply the remarks give a false impression of seriousness (i.e., they seem casual but he is actually serious), but the sentence says the remarks are casual and the lack of seriousness is real, so they don't contradict each other.",
          "Step 5: Confirm that 'betrayed' fits grammatically and semantically, completing the sentence with the meaning: His casual remarks unintentionally showed his lack of seriousness."
