        "reasoning": "The sentence states, 'His rather casual remarks on politics _______ his lack of seriousness about the subject.' We need a word that implies the remarks *revealed* or *showed* his lack of seriousness.\n\nA. **Masked**: To mask means to hide or conceal. If his remarks masked his lack of seriousness, it would mean he was trying to hide his lack of seriousness, or that the remarks gave a false impression of seriousness. This contradicts the idea that the remarks *showed* his lack of seriousness.\nB. **Belied**: To belie means to contradict or give a false impression. If his remarks belied his lack of seriousness, it would imply that the remarks suggested he *was* serious, which is the opposite of what the sentence intends.\nC. **Betrayed**: To betray, in this context, means to reveal unintentionally or to show. If his casual remarks betrayed his lack of seriousness, it means the remarks inadvertently revealed or demonstrated that he was not serious about politics. This fits the sentence perfectly.\nD. **Suppressed**: To suppress means to hold back or prevent from being expressed. If his remarks suppressed his lack of seriousness, it would mean the remarks prevented his lack of seriousness from being shown, which is contrary to the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, 'betrayed' is the most appropriate word as it conveys that the casual remarks served as an unintentional revelation of his true attitude."

          "Step 3: Evaluate option A, 'masked'. To mask means to hide. If remarks masked his lack of seriousness, they would conceal it, which is the opposite of what the sentence suggests.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate option B, 'belied'. To belie means to contradict or give a false impression. If remarks belied his lack of seriousness, they would make him seem serious, contradicting his actual lack of seriousness. This does not fit the context of the remarks *showing* his lack of seriousness.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate option C, 'betrayed'. To betray can mean to reveal unintentionally or to show. If remarks betrayed his lack of seriousness, they revealed it. This aligns perfectly with the sentence's implication.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate option D, 'suppressed'. To suppress means to hold back or prevent. If remarks suppressed his lack of seriousness, they would prevent it from being seen, which is contrary to the sentence's meaning.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that 'betrayed' is the most fitting word as it accurately conveys that the casual remarks served as an unintentional revelation of his lack of seriousness."
