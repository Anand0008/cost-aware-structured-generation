        "reasoning": "In the two-body problem, which accurately describes an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth, the gravitational force is a central force. A central force is always directed along the line connecting the two bodies (i.e., towards the center of mass of the Earth). For any central force, the torque ($\\mathbf{\\tau}$) about the center of the force is zero, because the position vector ($\\mathbf{r}$) and the force vector ($\\mathbf{F}$) are parallel or anti-parallel, making their cross product zero ($\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = 0$). According to Newton's second law for rotation, the rate of change of angular momentum ($\\mathbf{L}$) is equal to the net torque acting on the system ($\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt}$). Since the torque is zero, the rate of change of angular momentum is zero, implying that the angular momentum vector ($\\mathbf{L}$) is a constant. This principle holds true for any orbit (circular, elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) under a central gravitational force. Therefore, for a satellite in a highly elliptical orbit, its angular momentum about the center of mass of the Earth remains constant. This is also the underlying principle for Kepler's Second Law, as highlighted in RAG Chunk 5."
