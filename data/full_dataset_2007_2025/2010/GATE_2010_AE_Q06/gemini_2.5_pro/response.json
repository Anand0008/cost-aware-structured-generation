          "Step 1: Identify the fundamental relationship between takeoff ground roll distance ($s_{LO}$) and aircraft weight ($W$). From aircraft performance principles, it is known that $s_{LO}$ is proportional to $W^2$, assuming other factors like thrust, lift coefficient, and air density remain constant. This is explicitly stated in the simplified takeoff distance equation: $s_{LO} = \\frac{{1.44W^2}}{{g \\rho S C_{{L,max}} T}}$.",
          "Step 2: Express the given change in aircraft weight. The weight increases by 30%. If the original weight is $W_1$, the new weight $W_2$ will be $W_1 + 0.30 W_1 = 1.3 W_1$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the proportionality relationship to calculate the ratio of the new takeoff distance ($s_{LO2}$) to the original takeoff distance ($s_{LO1}$). Since $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$, we have $\\frac{s_{LO2}}{s_{LO1}} = \\left(\\frac{W_2}{W_1}\\right)^2$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the new weight in terms of the original weight into the ratio: $\\frac{s_{LO2}}{s_{LO1}} = (1.3)^2 = 1.69$. This means $s_{LO2} = 1.69 s_{LO1}$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the percentage increase in takeoff distance. The increase is $s_{LO2} - s_{LO1} = 1.69 s_{LO1} - s_{LO1} = 0.69 s_{LO1}$. As a percentage, this is $0.69 \\times 100\\% = 69\\%$. This value is approximately 70%."
