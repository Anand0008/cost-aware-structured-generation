For simple roots (where the first derivative of the function at the root is non-zero), the method exhibits quadratic convergence. This means that the error at the `(i+1)`-th iteration is proportional to the square of the error at the `i`-th iteration, i.e., `E_{i+1} \\approx C \\cdot E_i^2`. The order of convergence, denoted by `\\eta`, is 2.0 for quadratic convergence. The given equation `x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0` can be factored as `(x-1)(x-5) = 0`, yielding roots `x=1` and `x=5`. For `f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5`, the derivative is `f'(x) = 2x - 6`. At `x=1`, `f'(1) = 2(1) - 6 = -4 \\neq 0`. At `x=5`, `f'(5) = 2(5) - 6 = 4 \\neq 0`. Since the derivative is non-zero at both roots, these are simple roots, and thus the Newton-Raphson method will achieve its characteristic quadratic convergence of order 2.0."
