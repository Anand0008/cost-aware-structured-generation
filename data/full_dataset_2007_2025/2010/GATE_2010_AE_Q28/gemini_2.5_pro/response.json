        "reasoning": "The problem describes a uniform rigid rod of mass `m` and length `l` hinged at its upper end, oscillating as a physical pendulum. To find its natural frequency for small oscillations, we use the equation of motion for rotational dynamics.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** This is a physical pendulum, not a simple pendulum (where mass is concentrated at a point).\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (I) about the pivot:** For a uniform rod of mass `m` and length `l` rotating about an axis perpendicular to the rod and passing through one end (the hinge), the moment of inertia is given by `I = (1/3)ml^2`.\n3.  **Distance to the Center of Mass (h):** For a uniform rod, the center of mass (CM) is located at its geometric center, which is `l/2` from the hinge.\n4.  **Restoring Torque (M):** When the rod is displaced by a small angle `$\\theta$` from the vertical equilibrium position, the gravitational force `mg` acts at the CM. The restoring torque about the hinge is `M = - (mg) * h * sin(\\theta) = - (mg) * (l/2) * sin(\\theta)`. The negative sign indicates it's a restoring torque.\n5.  **Equation of Motion:** Applying Newton's second law for rotational motion, `$\\sum M = I \\ddot{\\theta}$`:\n    `$I \\ddot{\\theta} = - (mg) (l/2) sin(\\theta)$`\n    `$(1/3)ml^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + (mg) (l/2) sin(\\theta) = 0$`\n6.  **Linearization for Small Oscillations:** For small angles, `$\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$` (in radians).\n    `$(1/3)ml^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + (mg) (l/2) \\theta = 0$`\n7.  **Standard Form of SHM Equation:** Divide the entire equation by `$(1/3)ml^2$` to get it into the form `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\omega_n^2 \\theta = 0$`:\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{(mg)(l/2)}{(1/3)ml^2} \\theta = 0$`\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{3mg l}{2ml^2} \\theta = 0$`\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{3g}{2l} \\theta = 0$`\n8.  **Natural Angular Frequency ($\\omega_n$):** From the standard form, `$\\omega_n^2 = \\frac{3g}{2l}$`.\n    Therefore, the natural angular frequency is `$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{3g}{2l}}$`.\n\nThis matches option D."

          "Step 3: Locate the center of mass (CM) of the rod. For a uniform rod, the CM is at `l/2` from the hinged end.",
          "Step 4: Formulate the restoring torque (`M`) due to gravity when the rod is displaced by an angle `$\\theta$`. The torque is `M = - (mg) (l/2) sin(\\theta)`.",

          "Step 6: Linearize the equation for small oscillations. For small angles, `$\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$`. This simplifies the equation to `$(1/3)ml^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + (mg) (l/2) \\theta = 0$`.",
          "Step 7: Rearrange the linearized equation into the standard form of simple harmonic motion: `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\omega_n^2 \\theta = 0$`. Divide by `$(1/3)ml^2$` to isolate `$\\ddot{\\theta}$` and identify `$\\omega_n^2$` as the coefficient of `$\\theta$`. This yields `$\\omega_n^2 = \\frac{3g}{2l}$`.",

RAG Chunks 4 and 6 (Rigid Body Motion, Rod vs. String) provided useful context on rigid body dynamics and the nature of a rigid rod. However, the specific moment of inertia for a uniform rod about its end was not explicitly provided in the RAG context, requiring internal knowledge. The RAG chunks on axial and torsional vibrations (Chunks 1, 3, 5) were not directly relevant to this problem."
