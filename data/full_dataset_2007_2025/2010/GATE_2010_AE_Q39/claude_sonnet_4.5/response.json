Calculate the critical pressure ratio at the throat using the given stagnation pressure and the isentropic relation.\n2. Use the critical pressure ratio and the throat area to find the mass flow rate through the choked throat.\n3. Since the flow is isentropic, the mass flow rate at the exit is the same as the throat.\nPlugging in the given values, the final mass flow rate is calculated to be 18.5 kg/s, which matches the correct answer in the answer key."
