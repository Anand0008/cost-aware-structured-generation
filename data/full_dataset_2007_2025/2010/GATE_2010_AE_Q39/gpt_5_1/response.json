        "reasoning": "We are given combustion chamber (stagnation) pressure and temperature, gas properties (\\(\\gamma\\), \\(R\\)), and the throat area of a converging-diverging nozzle with supersonic exit flow and isentropic conditions. Supersonic exit plus isentropic flow implies the throat is choked (\\(M=1\\) at throat), so the mass flow rate is determined solely by stagnation conditions and throat area via the standard choked-flow formula. Using the choked mass flow rate expression (as in Anderson and Hill & Peterson, and also in the RAG chunks 1, 2, and 4):\n\\[\\dot{m} = A_t \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}\\]\nSubstituting \\(P_0 = 1.5\\times10^6\\,\\text{Pa}\\), \\(T_0 = 2500\\,\\text{K}\\), \\(\\gamma = 1.2\\), \\(R = 692.83\\,\\text{J/kgK}\\), \\(A_t = 0.025\\,\\text{m}^2\\):\n1) \\(\\sqrt{\\gamma/R} = \\sqrt{1.2/692.83} \\approx 0.0416\\,\\text{(SI)}\\).\n2) \\(P_0/\\sqrt{T_0} = 1.5\\times10^6 / \\sqrt{2500} = 1.5\\times10^6 / 50 = 30000\\,\\text{Pa/K}^{1/2}\\).\n3) The critical-flow function for \\(\\gamma=1.2\\): \\(\\left(\\tfrac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{(\\gamma+1)/(2(\\gamma-1))} = (2/2.2)^{(2.2)/(0.4)} = 0.9091^{5.5} \\approx 0.61\\).\nThen mass flux term: \\(\\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\gamma/R} \\approx 30000 \\times 0.0416 \\approx 1248\\,\\text{kg/(m}^2\\text{s)}\\). Multiply by 0.61 gives \\(\\approx 761\\,\\text{kg/(m}^2\\text{s)}\\). Finally, \\(\\dot{m} = 761 \\times 0.025 \\approx 19.0\\,\\text{kg/s}\\). With more precise arithmetic this comes out around 18.5–19 kg/s; option A (18.5 kg/s) is the closest and matches typical rounding in GATE solutions. Hence option A is validated."
