Chunk 5 offered excellent contextual information regarding choked flow and CD nozzle operation. Chunk 3 provided general isentropic relations. Chunk 6 was less relevant as stagnation properties were given."

    "question_text": "The stagnation pressure and stagnation temperature inside the combustion chamber of a liquid rocket engine are 1.5 MPa and 2500 K respectively. The burned gases have gamma = 1.2 and R = 692.83 J/kgK. The rocket has a converging - diverging nozzle with a throat area of 0.025 m^2 and the flow at the exit of the nozzle is supersonic. If the flow through the nozzle is isentropic, what is the mass flow rate of the gases out of the nozzle?"
