        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the stall speed in a level turn. First, the load factor (n) for a level turn at a bank angle ($\\phi$) of 60 degrees is calculated using the formula $n = 1 / \\cos(\\phi)$. For $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$, $n = 1 / \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 1 / 0.5 = 2$. The stall speed in a maneuver ($V_{s,maneuver}$) is related to the straight and level stall speed ($V_s$) by the formula $V_{s,maneuver} = V_s \\sqrt{n}$. Substituting the given $V_s = 40$ m/s and the calculated $n=2$, we get $V_{s,maneuver} = 40 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 40 \\times 1.4142 = 56.568$ m/s. This value is approximately 56.6 m/s, which matches option C."

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. The stall speed in straight and level flight ($V_s$) is 40 m/s. The bank angle ($\\phi$) for the level turn is 60 degrees.",
          "Step 2: Understand the concept of stall speed. Stall occurs when the maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$) is reached. The general formula for stall speed is $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L,max}}}$. In straight and level flight, Lift (L) equals Weight (W).",
          "Step 3: Calculate the load factor (n) for a level turn. In a level turn, the lift (L) must provide both the vertical component to support the weight and the horizontal component for the centripetal force. The load factor is defined as $n = L/W$. For a level turn, the vertical component of lift balances weight: $L \\cos(\\phi) = W$. Therefore, $L = W / \\cos(\\phi)$, and the load factor is $n = 1 / \\cos(\\phi)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the given bank angle into the load factor formula. For $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$, $n = 1 / \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 1 / 0.5 = 2$. This means the aircraft experiences twice its weight in terms of effective load during the turn.",
          "Step 5: Relate the stall speed in a maneuver to the straight and level stall speed. The stall speed in any flight condition is $V_{s,maneuver} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{\\rho S C_{L,max}}}$. Since $L = nW$ in a maneuver, we can write $V_{s,maneuver} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2nW}{\\rho S C_{L,max}}}$. We know that $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L,max}}}$. Therefore, $V_{s,maneuver} = V_s \\sqrt{n}$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the slowest speed for the level turn. Using the derived relationship, $V_{s,turn} = V_s \\sqrt{n} = 40 \\times \\sqrt{2}$.",
          "Step 7: Compute the final numerical value. $V_{s,turn} = 40 \\times 1.41421356 \\approx 56.568$ m/s. Rounding to one decimal place, this is 56.6 m/s."
