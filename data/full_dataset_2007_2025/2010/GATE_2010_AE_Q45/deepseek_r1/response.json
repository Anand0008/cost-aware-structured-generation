The slope of the tangent at any point on the curve is $dy/dx = e^x$, so at $(a, e^a)$, the slope is $e^a$. The equation of the tangent line using point-slope form is $y - e^a = e^a (x - a)$. For this line to pass through (0,0), substitute x=0, y=0: $-e^a = e^a (-a)$. Simplifying, $-1 = -a$, so $a = 1$. Substituting $a=1$ back gives the tangent equation: $y - e = e (x - 1)$ -> $y = ex$.
