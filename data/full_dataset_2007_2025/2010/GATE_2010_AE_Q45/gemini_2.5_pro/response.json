Therefore, $y_0 = e^{x_0}$.\n\n2.  **Find the slope of the tangent:** The derivative of $y = e^x$ is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x$. The slope of the tangent at $(x_0, y_0)$ is $m = e^{x_0}$.\n\n3.  **Write the equation of the tangent line:** Using the point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line is $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$. Substituting $y_0 = e^{x_0}$ and $m = e^{x_0}$, we get:\n    $y - e^{x_0} = e^{x_0}(x - x_0)$\n\n4.  **Use the condition that the tangent passes through the origin:** Since the tangent passes through the origin $(0,0)$, we substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the tangent equation:\n    $0 - e^{x_0} = e^{x_0}(0 - x_0)$\n    $-e^{x_0} = -x_0 e^{x_0}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $x_0$:** Since $e^{x_0}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by $e^{x_0}$:\n    $-1 = -x_0$\n    $x_0 = 1$\n\n6.  **Find $y_0$ and the slope $m$ at the point of tangency:**\n    $y_0 = e^{x_0} = e^1 = e$\n    $m = e^{x_0} = e^1 = e$\n\n7.  **Formulate the final equation of the tangent:** The tangent line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope $m=e$. Using the slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$), since it passes through the origin, $c=0$. Thus, the equation is:\n    $y = ex$\n\nThis matches option D."
