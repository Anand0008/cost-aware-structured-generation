For it to be tangent to y = e^x, the system e^x = m x must have exactly one solution, where the line and curve touch with equal slope. Define f(x) = e^x - m x. Tangency occurs when f(x) has a double root, i.e., f(x) = 0 and f'(x) = 0 at the same x. We have f'(x) = e^x - m. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives e^x = m. Substituting into f(x) = 0: e^x - m x = 0 ⇒ m - m x = 0 ⇒ m(1 - x) = 0. Since m ≠ 0 for a nontrivial line, x = 1. Then e^x = m ⇒ m = e. Thus the tangent from origin is y = e x, which corresponds to option D."
