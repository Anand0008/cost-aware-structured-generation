Ensure all units are consistent (e.g., convert MJ/kg to J/kg).",
          "Step 2: Recall the First Law of Thermodynamics applied to a control volume (the combustor). The energy balance states that the total enthalpy of the incoming air plus the effective chemical energy added by the fuel equals the total enthalpy of the outgoing combustion products.",
          "Step 3: Write down the energy balance equation: $\\dot{m}_a C_p T_{t2} + \\eta_b \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_p T_{t3}$. This equation accounts for the mass of fuel added to the air stream and the burner efficiency.",
          "Step 4: Divide the entire energy balance equation by the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) to introduce the fuel-air ratio ($f = \\dot{m}_f / \\dot{m}_a$). This simplifies the equation to $C_p T_{t2} + \\eta_b f Q_R = (1+f) C_p T_{t3}$.",
          "Step 5: Algebraically rearrange the equation to isolate and solve for the fuel-air ratio ($f$). This involves expanding the right side, collecting terms with $f$, and then dividing to get the final formula: $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2})}{\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3}}$.",
