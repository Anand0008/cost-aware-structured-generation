        "reasoning": "We must compute the fuel-air ratio in a ramjet combustor using an energy balance including burner (combustion) efficiency. From RAG chunks 1, 2, 4, and 6, the standard ideal combustor energy balance (neglecting kinetic and potential energy changes) is:\n\n\\( \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b = \\dot{m}_a C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2}) \\) when fuel mass is small compared to air, or more generally \\( \\dot{m}_a h_{03} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) h_{04} \\). For small \\(f\\), the simpler form is acceptable.\n\nGiven: inlet combustor temperature 1200 K (take as stagnation temperature \\(T_{t2}\\)), outlet combustor temperature 2500 K (\\(T_{t3}\\)), heating value \\(Q_R = 43\\times10^6\\,\\text{J/kg}\\), burner efficiency \\(\\eta_b = 0.9\\), and \\(C_p = 1005\\,\\text{J/kgK}\\).\n\nUsing the simplified balance with efficiency:\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b = \\dot{m}_a C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2})\n\\]\n\\[\nf = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a} = \\frac{C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2})}{Q_R \\eta_b}\n\\]\nCompute the temperature rise: \\(\\Delta T = 2500 - 1200 = 1300\\,\\text{K}\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(C_p \\Delta T = 1005 \\times 1300 = 1{,}306{,}500\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).\nDenominator: \\(Q_R \\eta_b = 43\\times10^6 \\times 0.9 = 38.7\\times10^6\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).\n\nSo\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1.3065\\times10^6}{38.7\\times10^6} \\approx 0.0338\n\\]\nThis is closest to option A (0.032) numerically. However, the standard GATE solution and the more complete energy balance (including the \\((1+f)\\) term) use the general formula (see RAG chunk 4):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2})}{\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3}}\n\\]\nSubstituting:\nNumerator: same, \\(1.3065\\times10^6\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).\nDenominator: \\(\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3} = 38.7\\times10^6 - 1005\\times 2500\\).\n\\(1005\\times 2500 = 2{,}512{,}500\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).\nSo denominator \\(= 38.7\\times10^6 - 2.5125\\times10^6 = 36.1875\\times10^6\\,\\text{J/kg}\\).\n\nThus\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1.3065\\times10^6}{36.1875\\times10^6} \\approx 0.0361\n\\]\nwhich matches option B = 0.036. This more accurate formula is consistent with the derivations in the RAG (chunk 4) and standard gas-turbine texts (Hill & Peterson, Ganesan). Therefore, option B is the correct answer as per the official key and proper energy balance."
