As the air density increases significantly from the inlet to the outlet due to compression, the flow cross-sectional area must decrease to accommodate the constant mass flow rate. This reduction in flow area is primarily achieved by decreasing the height of the compressor blades in the flow direction. Therefore, the correct answer is that the blade height decreases in the flow direction for a multi-stage axial compressor with constant diameter hub."
