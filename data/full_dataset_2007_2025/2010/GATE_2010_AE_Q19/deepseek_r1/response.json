Under the standard constant axial velocity ($V_x$) design principle, the continuity equation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$ (with constant mass flow $\\dot{m}$ and constant $V_x$) dictates that the flow area $A$ must decrease as $\\rho$ increases. With a constant diameter hub, the annulus area $A = \\pi D_{mean} h$ decreases solely by reducing the blade height $h$. Therefore, blade height decreases in the flow direction."
