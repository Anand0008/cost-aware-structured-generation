        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. The problem involves calculating the range of a propeller-powered aircraft under maximum range conditions, which is governed by the Breguet Range Equation. The condition 'trimmed to attain maximum range' implies that the aerodynamic efficiency (L/D) and engine parameters (propulsive efficiency $\\eta$ and power-specific fuel consumption $c_p$) are constant and optimized.",
          "Step 2: Write down the Breguet Range Equation for propeller aircraft. The general form is $R = \\frac{\\eta}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)_{max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\\right)$. For this problem, we can simplify the constant terms as $K = \\frac{\\eta}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)_{max}$, so $R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\\right)$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the equation to the first scenario. The aircraft consumes 20% of its take-off weight ($W_{TO}$) as fuel, traveling a distance R. The initial weight is $W_{TO}$ and the final weight is $W_{TO} - 0.20 W_{TO} = 0.80 W_{TO}$. Substitute these into the simplified equation: $R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{TO}}{0.80 W_{TO}}\\right) = K \\ln(1.25)$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the equation to the second scenario. The aircraft consumes a total of 50% of its take-off weight ($W_{TO}$) as fuel, traveling a new distance $R'$. The initial weight is $W_{TO}$ and the final weight is $W_{TO} - 0.50 W_{TO} = 0.50 W_{TO}$. Substitute these into the simplified equation: $R' = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{TO}}{0.50 W_{TO}}\\right) = K \\ln(2)$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the two ranges. To find $R'$ in terms of $R$, divide the equation for $R'$ by the equation for $R$. This eliminates the constant $K$: $\\frac{R'}{R} = \\frac{K \\ln(2)}{K \\ln(1.25)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.25)}$.",
          "Step 6: Compute the numerical value. Calculate the natural logarithms: $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$ and $\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.2231$. Perform the division: $\\frac{R'}{R} \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.2231} \\approx 3.1066$.",
          "Step 7: Determine the final answer. From the calculation, $R' \\approx 3.1066 \\cdot R$. Compare this result with the given options to select the closest one, which is 3.1 R."
