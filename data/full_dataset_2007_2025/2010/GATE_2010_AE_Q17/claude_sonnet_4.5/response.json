        "reasoning": "The natural frequency of bending vibration for a horizontal cantilevered beam is highest when the beam has the largest moment of inertia about the axis of vibration. From the given options, the beam with b = 25 and d = 4 (option D) will have the largest moment of inertia I_x = (b*d^3)/12. This is because the depth d is the dimension perpendicular to the axis of vibration, and it has the strongest cubic relationship with I_x. Increasing the depth d from 4 to 5, 10, or 20 (as in the other options) will decrease the moment of inertia and thus the natural frequency. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
