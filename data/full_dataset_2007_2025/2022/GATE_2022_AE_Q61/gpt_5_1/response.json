        "reasoning": "The I-section is thin-walled with uniform thickness t = 0.6 mm. The flange width is 2b = 20 mm ⇒ b = 10 mm, and the web height is also 2b = 20 mm. For a thin-walled open section, the second moment of area about the horizontal centroidal axis is obtained by summing contributions of each wall segment using the parallel-axis theorem, approximating each wall as a line of area t·length located at its midline. Because the section is symmetric about the horizontal axis, the centroid lies at mid-depth, so the web lies on the neutral axis and contributes negligibly to I_xx (its own I about its centroidal horizontal axis is t·h^3/12, but with t ≪ h this is very small compared to flange contributions). Each flange is a thin rectangle of length 2b = 20 mm and thickness t = 0.6 mm, located at a distance of b = 10 mm from the centroidal axis. The exact area of each flange is A_f = (2b)·t = 20×0.6 = 12 mm^2. Its own second moment about its own centroidal horizontal axis is I_c = (b_f·t^3)/12 = (20·0.6^3)/12 ≈ 0.36 mm^4, which is negligible compared to A_f y^2 = 12×10^2 = 1200 mm^4. Thus, I_xx ≈ 2·A_f·b^2 = 2·12·10^2 = 2400 mm^4. Including the small flange self-terms and the web term I_web = t·(2b)^3/12 = 0.6·20^3/12 ≈ 400 mm^4, the total becomes about 2400 + 400 + 2·0.36 ≈ 2801 mm^4. This lies within the official answer range 2700–2960 mm^4, confirming consistency with the key."
