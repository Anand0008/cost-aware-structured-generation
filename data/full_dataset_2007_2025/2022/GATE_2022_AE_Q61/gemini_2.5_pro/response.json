          "Step 2: Determine the total height of the I-section and locate its centroid. For a symmetric I-section, the centroid lies at the geometric center. The total height `H_{total} = t + h_w + t = 0.6 + 20 + 0.6 = 21.2` mm. The centroidal horizontal axis is at `H_{total}/2 = 10.6` mm from the bottom.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the second moment of area of the web about the overall centroidal axis. Since the web's centroid coincides with the overall centroid, use the formula for a rectangle: `I_{web} = (t \\cdot h_w^3) / 12`.",

This involves finding the moment of inertia of the flange about its own centroid (`I_{c,flange} = (b_f \\cdot t^3) / 12`), its area (`A_{flange} = b_f \\cdot t`), and the distance (`d`) from its centroid to the overall centroidal axis (`d = h_w/2 + t/2`). Then, `I_{flange} = I_{c,flange} + A_{flange} \\cdot d^2`.",
