Lower collagen is explicitly stated as making the skin 'more fragile,' which is a disadvantage, not an advantage. Avoiding predators is an advantage of the ultra-black skin itself, not of the lower collagen.",

          "Step 7: Evaluate Option D: 'Having ultra-black skin is only disadvantageous to species S but advantageous only to their predators.' This is incorrect. The passage clearly states advantages for species S and identifies the fragility as a disadvantage for species S, not an advantage for predators in the context of the skin's properties.",
