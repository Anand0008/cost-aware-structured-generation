For the propped cantilever (Case II, fixed at P, simply supported at Q) with a mid-point load, the fixed end moment is $M_{P,II} = 3FL/16$ (hogging). Bending stress $\\sigma = M/Z$, where Z is the section modulus (same for both cases). The ratio is $\\frac{M_{P,I}}{M_{P,II}} = \\frac{FL/2}{3FL/16} = 8/3 \\approx 2.6667$, which rounds to 2.7 as per the answer key range (2.6 to 2.7)."

Bending stress $\\sigma_{max} = M_{max} / Z$, where $M_{max}$ is the maximum bending moment at P and Z is the section modulus (constant for the rectangular cross-section). Thus, the stress ratio equals the bending moment ratio.",

Use compatibility: deflection at Q due to F and due to the redundant reaction $R_Q$ must sum to zero. Using cantilever deflection formulas: Deflection at Q due to F at L/2: $\\delta_{F} = \\frac{F (L/2)^2}{6EI}(3L - L/2) = \\frac{5FL^3}{48EI}$. Deflection at Q due to a tip load $R_Q$: $\\delta_{R} = \\frac{R_Q L^3}{3EI}$. Setting total deflection zero: $\\frac{5FL^3}{48EI} - \\frac{R_Q L^3}{3EI} = 0 \\Rightarrow R_Q = \\frac{5F}{16}$ (upward).",
          "Step 4: Compute bending moment at P in Case II. Take moments about P from forces to the right: $M_{P,II} = R_Q \\cdot L - F \\cdot (L/2) = \\frac{5F}{16}L - \\frac{FL}{2} = \\frac{5FL}{16} - \\frac{8FL}{16} = -\\frac{3FL}{16}$. Magnitude: $|M_{P,II}| = 3FL/16$.",

However, none directly addressed propped cantilever analysis. The solution relied on internal knowledge of beam deflection superposition and propped cantilever results. Chunks 1,2,4,5,6 cover cantilever basics; Chunk 3 discusses variable EI but not directly relevant."

A cantilever PQ of rectangular cross-section is subjected to transverse load, F, at its mid-point. Two cases are considered as shown in the figure. In Case I, the end Q is free and in Case II, Q is simply supported. The ratio of the magnitude of the maximum bending stress at P in Case I to that in Case II is ________ (rounded off to one decimal place)."
