        "reasoning": "We must compare maximum bending stress at the fixed end P for two configurations of the same prismatic cantilever PQ (total length 2l) with a transverse load F at the mid-point R. Since the cross-section is the same, the ratio of bending stresses equals the ratio of bending moments at P.\n\nCase I (Q free): A standard cantilever of length 2l with a point load F at distance l from the fixed end. Reaction at P is F upward and a fixed-end moment M_P1 = F \\times l (taking moments about P). Thus maximum bending stress at P is proportional to F l.\n\nCase II (Q simply supported): Now P is still fixed, Q is a simple support, and the load F acts at mid-span R (distance l from each support). This is a propped cantilever. Let R_P and R_Q be vertical reactions at P and Q, and M_P2 the fixed-end moment at P. Static equilibrium gives:\n1) Vertical forces: R_P + R_Q = F.\n2) Moments about P: M_P2 + R_Q (2l) - F l = 0.\n\nWe need a third equation from compatibility: vertical deflection at Q must be zero. The deflection at any point is the superposition of deflections due to each load acting on a simple cantilever of length 2l fixed at P and free at Q. Using the given standard results for a tip-loaded cantilever (tip deflection N L^3 / 3EI and tip slope N L^2 / 2EI), we treat each load as applied at its own position and express deflection at Q.\n\nTake positive downward deflection. Contributions at Q:\n- Due to R_P at P: zero (load at fixed end causes no deflection at that point).\n- Due to F at R (distance l from P): Equivalent to a point load at distance l from fixed end on a cantilever of length 2l. The deflection at the free end (Q) equals deflection at a point at distance 2l from the fixed end due to a load at l. Using standard beam deflection formulas (or by superposition of two tip-loaded segments), this gives downward deflection of magnitude (5 F l^3)/(6 EI).\n- Due to R_Q at Q (distance 2l from P): This is a tip load at the free end of a cantilever of length 2l, so deflection at Q is upward with magnitude R_Q (2l)^3 / (3 EI) = 8 R_Q l^3 / (3 EI).\n\nCompatibility (net deflection at Q zero):\n(5 F l^3)/(6 EI) - 8 R_Q l^3 / (3 EI) = 0 \\Rightarrow 5F/6 = 8 R_Q/3 \\Rightarrow R_Q = (5/16) F.\nThen from force equilibrium, R_P = F - R_Q = (11/16) F.\nFrom moment equilibrium about P: M_P2 + R_Q (2l) - F l = 0 \\Rightarrow M_P2 = F l - 2 l R_Q = F l - 2 l (5F/16) = F l (1 - 5/8) = (3/8) F l.\n\nThus the maximum bending moment at P in Case II is M_P2 = (3/8) F l, much smaller than in Case I (F l). The ratio of maximum bending stresses is therefore:\n\\[ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max, I}}{\\sigma_{\\max, II}} = \\frac{M_{P1}}{M_{P2}} = \\frac{F l}{(3/8) F l} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67. \\]\nThis lies in the official answer range 2.6 to 2.7."

          "Identify that maximum bending stress at P is proportional to the bending moment at P because the cross-section is the same in both cases: \\(\\sigma_{\\max} = M c / I\\). So the required ratio equals \\(M_{P,\\text{Case I}} / M_{P,\\text{Case II}}\\).",
          "Case I: Treat PQ as a simple cantilever of length 2l fixed at P and free at Q with a point load F at R (distance l from P). Taking moments about P, the fixed-end moment is \\(M_{P1} = F l\\).",
          "Case II: P is fixed, Q is simply supported, and load F is at mid-span R. Let vertical reactions at P and Q be \\(R_P\\) and \\(R_Q\\), and fixed-end moment at P be \\(M_{P2}\\). From equilibrium: (i) \\(R_P + R_Q = F\\); (ii) taking moments about P: \\(M_{P2} + 2 l R_Q - F l = 0\\).",
          "Introduce compatibility: vertical deflection at Q must be zero because Q is a simple support. Use superposition on an equivalent cantilever of length 2l fixed at P and free at Q, loaded by F at R and reaction \\(R_Q\\) at Q. The given formulas for a tip-loaded cantilever (deflection \\(N L^3 / 3EI\\)) allow us to compute deflections due to these loads.",
          "Compute deflection at Q due to F at R: using standard cantilever deflection relations (or by segment superposition), the downward deflection at Q is \\(\\delta_F = (5 F l^3)/(6 EI)\\). Compute deflection at Q due to \\(R_Q\\) at Q: this is a tip load on a cantilever of length 2l, giving upward deflection \\(\\delta_{R_Q} = 8 R_Q l^3 / (3 EI)\\).",
          "Apply compatibility: net deflection at Q is zero, so \\(\\delta_F - \\delta_{R_Q} = 0\\). This yields \\( (5 F l^3)/(6 EI) = 8 R_Q l^3 / (3 EI) \\Rightarrow R_Q = (5/16) F\\). Then \\(R_P = F - R_Q = (11/16) F\\).",
          "Use moment equilibrium about P to find \\(M_{P2}\\): \\(M_{P2} + 2 l R_Q - F l = 0 \\Rightarrow M_{P2} = F l - 2 l R_Q = F l - 2 l (5F/16) = (3/8) F l\\).",
          "Form the ratio of maximum bending stresses: \\(\\sigma_{\\max,I} / \\sigma_{\\max,II} = M_{P1} / M_{P2} = (F l) / ((3/8) F l) = 8/3 \\approx 2.67\\), which rounds to about 2.7 and lies within the given correct range."

A cantilever PQ of rectangular cross-section is subjected to transverse load, F, at its mid-point. Two cases are considered as shown in the figure. In Case I, the end Q is free and in Case II, Q is simply supported.
