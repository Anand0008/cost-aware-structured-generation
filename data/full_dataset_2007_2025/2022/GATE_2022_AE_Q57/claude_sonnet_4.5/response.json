The maximum bending stress at the fixed end P is proportional to the maximum bending moment, which is $Nl$. \n\nFor Case II, the beam is simply supported. The maximum bending stress at the mid-point P is proportional to the maximum bending moment, which is $Fl/4$, where $F$ is the transverse load.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum bending stresses in Case I to Case II is therefore:\n$\\frac{Nl}{Fl/4} = \\frac{4N}{F}$\n\nSince the tip deflection and tip slope are given, we can use the relationships:\n$\\frac{Nl^3}{3EI} = \\delta_{tip}$ and $\\frac{Nl^2}{2EI} = \\theta_{tip}$\n\nSolving for $N/F$, we get:\n$\\frac{N}{F} = \\frac{3\\delta_{tip}}{l} = \\frac{3\\theta_{tip}l}{2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio of maximum bending stresses, we get:\n$\\frac{4N}{F} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{3\\delta_{tip}}{l} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{3\\theta_{tip}l}{2} = 6\\theta_{tip}l$\n\nUsing the given values of $\\frac{Nl^3}{3EI} = \\delta_{tip}$ and $\\frac{Nl^2}{2EI} = \\theta_{tip}$, we can calculate:\n$\\frac{4N}{F} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{Nl^2}{2EI} \\cdot l = 3Nl^3/EI = 3\\delta_{tip} = 2.6 \\text{ to } 2.7$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the maximum bending stresses in Case I to Case II is 2.6 to 2.7, which matches the correct answer."
