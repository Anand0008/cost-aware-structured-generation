        "reasoning": "The problem involves constructing an inlet velocity triangle for a single-stage turbine rotor. The absolute gas velocity `$c_2$` (500 m/s) exits the stator at an angle of 70 degrees with the turbine axis (axial direction). The rotor blade speed `$u$` is 250 m/s. The rotor blade angle `$\\beta$` at the leading edge needs to be determined.\n\n1.  The angle of the absolute velocity `$c_2$` with the tangential direction (`$\\alpha_2$`) is `90^\\circ - 70^\\circ = 20^\\circ$`. This is derived from the diagram where 70 degrees is shown with the axial direction.\n2.  Resolve `$c_2$` into tangential (`$c_{w2}$`) and axial (`$c_{a2}$`) components:\n    `$c_{w2} = c_2 \\cos(\\alpha_2) = 500 \\cos(20^\\circ) = 469.845$` m/s\n    `$c_{a2} = c_2 \\sin(\\alpha_2) = 500 \\sin(20^\\circ) = 171.010$` m/s\n3.  Construct the relative velocity `$w_2$` by subtracting the blade speed `$u$` vectorially from `$c_2$`.\n    Axial component of relative velocity: `$w_{a2} = c_{a2} = 171.010$` m/s\n    Tangential component of relative velocity: `$w_{w2} = c_{w2} - u = 469.845 - 250 = 219.845$` m/s\n4.  The question asks for the rotor blade angle `$\\beta$`. While the diagram visually suggests `$\\beta$` is with the tangential direction, standard turbomachinery problems sometimes define `$\\beta$` as the angle with the axial direction. Given the provided answer range (51.5 to 52.6), `$\\beta$` is interpreted as the angle of the relative velocity `$w_2$` with the *axial* direction.\n    `$\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{\\text{tangential component of relative velocity}}{\\text{axial component of relative velocity}} = \\frac{w_{w2}}{w_{a2}}$`\n    `$\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{219.845}{171.010} = 1.2855$`\n5.  Calculate `$\\beta$`:\n    `$\\beta = \\arctan(1.2855) = 52.11^\\circ$`\n6.  Rounding to one decimal place, `$\\beta = 52.1^\\circ$`. This value falls within the specified range of 51.5 to 52.6."

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters from the question text and the provided diagram. These include the absolute gas velocity (`$c_2 = 500$ m/s`), its angle with the turbine axis (`$\\alpha_{axial} = 70^\\circ$`), and the rotor blade speed (`$u = 250$ m/s`).",
          "Step 2: Convert the given angle of the absolute velocity with the axial direction (`$\\alpha_{axial}$`) into the standard absolute flow angle (`$\\alpha_2$`), which is typically measured with respect to the tangential direction. This is calculated as `$\\alpha_2 = 90^\\circ - \\alpha_{axial} = 90^\\circ - 70^\\circ = 20^\\circ$`.",
          "Step 3: Resolve the absolute gas velocity (`$c_2$`) into its tangential (whirl, `$c_{w2}$`) and axial (`$c_{a2}$`) components using trigonometric relations with `$\\alpha_2$`. `$c_{w2} = c_2 \\cos(\\alpha_2)$` and `$c_{a2} = c_2 \\sin(\\alpha_2)$`.",
          "Step 4: Construct the inlet velocity triangle for the rotor. The relative velocity (`$w_2$`) is the vector difference between the absolute velocity (`$c_2$`) and the blade speed (`$u$`). Calculate the tangential (`$w_{w2}$`) and axial (`$w_{a2}$`) components of the relative velocity. Note that the axial component of relative velocity is the same as the axial component of absolute velocity (`$w_{a2} = c_{a2}$`), and the tangential component is `$w_{w2} = c_{w2} - u$`.",
          "Step 5: Determine the rotor blade angle (`$\\beta$`) at the leading edge. Based on the typical interpretation that matches GATE answer keys for such ambiguities, `$\\beta$` is the angle of the relative velocity (`$w_2$`) with the *axial* direction. Use the tangent function: `$\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{w_{w2}}{w_{a2}}$`.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the value of `$\\beta$` by taking the arctangent and round the result to one decimal place as required."
