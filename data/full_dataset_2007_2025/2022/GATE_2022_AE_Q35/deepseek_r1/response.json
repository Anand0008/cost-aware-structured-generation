        "reasoning": "The answer is derived by constructing the inlet velocity triangle for the rotor. Given: absolute velocity c₂ = 500 m/s at α₂ = 70° from the axial direction (as per image description), and blade speed u = 250 m/s. Assuming constant axial velocity, the axial component c_a₂ = c₂ cos(α₂) = 500 cos70° ≈ 171.01 m/s, and tangential component c_w₂ = c₂ sin(α₂) = 500 sin70° ≈ 469.85 m/s. The relative velocity tangential component is w_w₂ = c_w₂ - u = 219.85 m/s. The rotor blade angle β at leading edge (for shock-free entry) is the angle of relative velocity from axial direction: β = arctan(w_w₂ / c_a₂) = arctan(219.85 / 171.01) ≈ 52.1°.
