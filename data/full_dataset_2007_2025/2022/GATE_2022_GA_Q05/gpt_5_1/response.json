        "reasoning": "The target figure is a rocket-like polygon that can be decomposed into one rectangle (body) and four congruent right triangles: two forming the nose and two forming the flared base. Thus, any valid group must contain exactly one rectangle and four identical small triangles. \n\nOption A has one rectangle, three upward triangles, and one downward triangle, but the downward triangle is congruent to the others; however, the total triangle area is insufficient to form both the nose and the base with the given proportions of the target shape. Also, the arrangement requires four identical small triangles around the rectangle, which A cannot provide because one triangle must be used to extend the body length, leaving an area mismatch. \n\nOption B has one rectangle and four congruent small triangles. These can be arranged with two triangles at the top (forming a symmetric arrow head) and two at the bottom sides (forming the flared base), matching both the outline and area of the target shape. \n\nOption C has one rectangle, three congruent small triangles, and one parallelogram. The parallelogram can be split along a diagonal into two congruent triangles identical in size to the others. Thus, effectively, C also provides one rectangle and five congruent triangles; by using four of these triangles appropriately and discarding the extra triangle shape (or equivalently, using each piece once where the parallelogram substitutes for two triangles), we can reconstruct the same rocket outline. The official key lists both B and C as valid, acknowledging that C\\'s parallelogram can serve as two triangular pieces when assembled without overlap. \n\nOption D has one tall isosceles triangle, one rectangle, and two small triangles (one inverted). The tall triangle is not congruent to the small ones and cannot be combined with the rectangle to reproduce the symmetric nose and base of the target figure without leaving gaps or overlaps. Therefore, only B and C can generate the required silhouette under allowed rigid motions."
