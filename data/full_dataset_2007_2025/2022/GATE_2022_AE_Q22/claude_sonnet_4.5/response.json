However, the introduction of the cut at the center of the bottom edge breaks the symmetry of the cross-section, causing the shear center to move away from the centroid. \n\nOn the other hand, the centroid of the cross-section remains unchanged, as it is a geometric property that depends only on the shape and dimensions of the cross-section, not the presence of a cut.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (A): Centroids of (i) and (ii) coincide while shear centers do not."
