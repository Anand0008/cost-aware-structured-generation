While the specific matrix is not provided in the prompt, the standard numerical method to find the largest (dominant) eigenvalue is the Power Method (also known as the Matrix Iteration Method). This method iteratively multiplies an initial trial vector by the matrix, normalizing at each step, until the vector converges to the dominant eigenvector and the scaling factor converges to the dominant eigenvalue. Given the answer key specifies '2 to 2', it implies the largest eigenvalue of the matrix presented in the actual GATE exam was 2. The Power Method, if applied to that matrix, would yield this result."

          "Step 6: Repeat the iteration. Use the newly normalized vector `X_1` as the input for the next step: `Y_2 = A * X_1`. Again, normalize `Y_2` to get `X_2` and obtain `lambda_2` from `max(abs(Y_2))`.",
