Normalize: X_k+1 = Y_k+1 / max(Y_k+1)\n5. The eigenvalue lambda_k+1 is approximated by max(Y_k+1).\n\nThe power method converges to the largest eigenvalue of the dynamic matrix A. Since A = M^-1 * K, its eigenvalues are omega^2, where omega are the natural frequencies. Therefore, the largest eigenvalue of A corresponds to the highest natural frequency.\n\nIn this case, the question asks for the largest eigenvalue, which based on the explanation should be a value between 2 and 2. Therefore, the answer provided in the key (2 to 2) is correct."
