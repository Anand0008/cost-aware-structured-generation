The 2nd February of that year is a Tuesday:** If February 1st is a Monday, then February 2nd logically follows as a Tuesday. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **B. There will be five Sundays in the month of February in that year:** If February 1st is a Monday, then February 7th is a Sunday. The Sundays in that month would be February 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th. There are only four Sundays. This statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **C. The 1st February of that year is a Sunday:** This contradicts our initial deduction that February 1st must be a Monday for there to be a fifth Monday. This statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **D. All Mondays of February in that year have even dates:** If February 1st is a Monday, the Mondays would fall on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. The dates 1, 15, and 29 are odd.
