        "reasoning": "In a chemical rocket, the highest static temperature occurs in the main combustion chamber where propellants burn at nearly constant pressure before expansion. As the gas expands through the nozzle, static temperature decreases from chamber to throat to exit. However, the region of maximum convective heat flux to the wall is not where static temperature is highest, but where the product of heat transfer coefficient and temperature difference is largest. The convective heat flux is given by $q'' = h (T_{g} - T_{w})$ or more precisely $q'' = h (T_{aw} - T_{w})$. RAG chunks 1–5 clearly state that the heat transfer coefficient $h$ and the heat flux $q''$ peak at the nozzle throat due to sonic/high velocity flow, thin boundary layer, and high shear. Therefore: region of highest static temperature = combustion chamber; region of highest heat flux = nozzle throat. This matches option B."
