        "reasoning": "The question asks for two distinct regions: the region of highest static temperature and the region of highest heat flux. \\n\\n1.  **Region of highest static temperature:** In a rocket engine, combustion occurs in the combustion chamber. This is where the chemical energy of the propellants is converted into thermal energy, resulting in the highest gas temperatures. As the hot gases expand through the nozzle, their static temperature decreases due to the conversion of thermal energy into kinetic energy (acceleration). Therefore, the highest static temperature is found in the **combustion chamber**. \\n\\n2.  **Region of highest heat flux:** The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) consistently states that the maximum convective heat flux to the nozzle wall occurs at the **nozzle throat**. This is because, at the throat, the gas velocity is sonic (highest local velocity), the boundary layer is thinnest, and the convective heat transfer coefficient (`h`) is at its peak. Although the gas temperature in the combustion chamber is higher, the heat transfer coefficient is lower there compared to the throat, where the combination of high velocity, turbulence, and temperature difference results in the highest heat transfer rate. The heat flux is given by `q_dot'' = h * (T_aw - T_w)`, where `h` and `T_aw` (adiabatic wall temperature) are highest at the throat. \\n\\nCombining these, the region of highest static temperature is the combustion chamber, and the region of highest heat flux is the nozzle throat. This corresponds to option B."

          "Step 5: Based on fundamental fluid dynamics and heat transfer principles in nozzles, the highest gas velocity (sonic), thinnest boundary layer, and maximum shear stress occur at the nozzle throat. These factors lead to the highest convective heat transfer coefficient (`h`) at the throat.",
          "Step 6: Even though the static gas temperature is highest in the combustion chamber, the combination of very high `h` and a significant temperature difference at the throat results in the maximum heat flux occurring at the **nozzle throat**, as explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge.",
