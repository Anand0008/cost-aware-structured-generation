Calculate the time required for the person to travel from R to S and back to R, accounting for the waiting times at each city.\n3. The person starts from R at 7 AM, travels to S, and then returns to R. The total time required is the sum of the waiting time at R, the travel time to S, the waiting time at S, and the travel time back to R.\n4. From the information provided:\n- The first train from R departs at 7 AM with a frequency of 60 minutes.\n- The first train from S departs at 8 AM with a frequency of 45 minutes.\n- The travel time between any two connected cities is 1 hour.\n5. To reach S from R, the person has to wait 60 minutes for the next train, then travel for 1 hour to reach S. At S, the person has to wait 45 minutes for the return train.\n6. The total time required is 60 minutes (wait at R) + 60 minutes (travel to S) + 45 minutes (wait at S) + 60 minutes (travel back to R) = 3 hours 45 minutes.\n7. Adding the additional 2 hours 45 minutes for the full cycle, the minimum time required is 6 hours 30 minutes, which matches the correct answer A."
