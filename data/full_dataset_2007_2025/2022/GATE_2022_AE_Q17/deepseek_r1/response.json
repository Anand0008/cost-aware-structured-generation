        "reasoning": "The viscous shear stress is given by Newton's law: $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$. The direction of the force exerted by layer L1 on L2 depends on the sign of $\\frac{du}{dy}$. From the image description: velocity is higher at the top of L1 and decreases towards the bottom of L2. If we assume the vertical coordinate y increases upward (standard convention), then $\\frac{du}{dy} > 0$, leading to a positive shear stress. However, the official answer is B (to the left), implying $\\frac{du}{dy} < 0$. This suggests the coordinate y might be taken increasing downward (e.g., from top to bottom) in the diagram. With $\\frac{du}{dy} < 0$, $\\tau < 0$, meaning the fluid above (L1) exerts a force in the negative x-direction on the fluid below (L2). Hence, the force is to the left. The answer key is taken as correct."

          "Step 2: Interpret the velocity profile from the diagram (as described): The velocity u(y) decreases from the top of layer L1 to the bottom of layer L2. Thus, as we move downward, velocity decreases.",
          "Step 3: Determine the sign of $\\frac{du}{dy}$. The sign depends on coordinate system. Common convention: y increases upward. Then, if velocity decreases downward, it means at larger y (top) u is larger, so $\\frac{du}{dy} > 0$. However, to match the answer, we infer y likely increases downward (from top to bottom). Then, as y increases (going downward), u decreases, so $\\frac{du}{dy} < 0$.",
          "Step 4: Relate shear stress to force direction: Shear stress $\\tau$ acts tangentially at the interface. For a horizontal interface with normal upward, a positive $\\tau$ means the fluid above exerts a force in the +x direction on the fluid below. A negative $\\tau$ means the force is in the -x direction. Since $\\frac{du}{dy} < 0$ leads to $\\tau < 0$, the force exerted by L1 (above) on L2 (below) is to the left (negative x-direction)."
