        "reasoning": "The NACA 4-digit series uses the format `P M TT` to designate airfoil shapes, where:\n1.  **First digit (P):** Represents the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord. So, `Max Camber = (P / 100) * c`.\n2.  **Second digit (M):** Represents the location of the maximum camber from the leading edge as a percentage of the chord, in tenths. So, `Location of Max Camber = (M / 10) * c`.\n3.  **Last two digits (TT):** Represent the maximum thickness as a percentage of the chord. So, `Max Thickness = (TT / 100) * c`.\n\nFor the NACA 2412 airfoil:\n-   The first digit is '2', meaning the maximum camber is `2%` of the chord.\n-   The second digit is '4', meaning the location of the maximum camber is at `4/10 = 0.4` times the chord, or `40%` of the chord from the leading edge.\n-   The last two digits are '12', meaning the maximum thickness is `12%` of the chord.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A. 4% maximum camber with respect to chord:** Incorrect. The maximum camber is 2% of the chord.\n-   **B. maximum camber at 40% chord:** Correct. The second digit '4' indicates the location of maximum camber at 40% of the chord.\n-   **C. 12% maximum thickness to chord ratio:** Correct. The last two digits '12' indicate a maximum thickness of 12% of the chord.\n-   **D. maximum camber at 20% chord:** Incorrect. The maximum camber is at 40% of the chord.\n\nTherefore, options B and C are the correct statements."
