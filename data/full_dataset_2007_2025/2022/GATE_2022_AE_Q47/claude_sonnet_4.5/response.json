Therefore, statement A is correct.\nFor the thrust coefficient, the formula shows that CF is a function of the pressure ratio Pc/Pa and the nozzle expansion ratio Ae/At. Since the nozzle expansion ratio is the same in both cases, the change in CF will be due to the change in pressure ratio. A higher pressure ratio (50 bar vs 20 bar) will result in a higher thrust coefficient, so statement D is also correct."
