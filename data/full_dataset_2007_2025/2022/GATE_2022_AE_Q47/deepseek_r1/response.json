For the same nozzle, $A_e/A_t=3.5$ fixed, so from isentropic flow, $P_e/P_c$ is constant. Thus for $P_{c2}=50$ bar, $P_{e2} = (P_{e1}/P_{c1}) P_{c2} = (1/20)*50 = 2.5$ bar. $C_F$ has a momentum term (function of $P_e/P_c$, same for both) and a pressure term $((P_e-P_a)/P_c)(A_e/A_t)$. For case 1, pressure term is zero; for case 2, it is positive: $((2.5-1)/50)*3.5 = 0.105$. Hence $C_{F,2} = C_{F,1} + 0.105 > C_{F,1}$, so $C_{F,2}/C_{F,1} > 1$ (D). Then $F_2/F_1 = (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1})*(P_{c2}/P_{c1}) = (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1})*2.5 > 2.5$ (B)."

The hot exhaust is optimally expanded to 1 bar (absolute pressure) using a convergent-divergent nozzle with exit to throat area ratio (Ae/At) of 3.5 and thrust coefficient, CF,1 = 1.42. The same rocket when operated at an absolute chamber pressure of 50 bar produces thrust F2 and the thrust coefficient is CF,2. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?"
