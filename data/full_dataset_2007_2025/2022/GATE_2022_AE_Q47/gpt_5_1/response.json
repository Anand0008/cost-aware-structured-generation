        "reasoning": "Thrust for a rocket is given by $F = C_F P_c A_t$ (neglecting weight and assuming same propellant and geometry). The nozzle geometry (including $A_e/A_t$) is unchanged, and the question explicitly states that at 20 bar the flow is optimally expanded to 1 bar with $C_{F,1} = 1.42$. When chamber pressure is raised to 50 bar while ambient remains 1 bar and the same nozzle is used, the exit pressure will no longer equal ambient: $P_e/P_c$ decreases, making the nozzle more underexpanded. From the thrust coefficient expression, a lower $P_e/P_c$ at fixed $P_a$ and fixed $A_e/A_t$ increases $C_F$. Therefore $C_{F,2} > C_{F,1}$, so option D is correct and C is false. For thrust ratio, \n$\\displaystyle \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \\frac{C_{F,2} P_{c2} A_t}{C_{F,1} P_{c1} A_t} = \\frac{C_{F,2}}{C_{F,1}} \\cdot \\frac{50}{20} = 2.5 \\cdot \\frac{C_{F,2}}{C_{F,1}}$. Since $C_{F,2}/C_{F,1} > 1$, we must have $F_2/F_1 > 2.5$, so B is correct and A is false. This matches the official key."

          "Step 2: For the same rocket hardware, $A_t$ and nozzle geometry (hence $A_e/A_t$) remain constant when $P_c$ changes from 20 bar to 50 bar.",
          "Step 3: Write the thrust ratio: $\\dfrac{F_2}{F_1} = \\dfrac{C_{F,2} P_{c2} A_t}{C_{F,1} P_{c1} A_t} = \\dfrac{C_{F,2}}{C_{F,1}} \\cdot \\dfrac{P_{c2}}{P_{c1}} = \\dfrac{C_{F,2}}{C_{F,1}} \\cdot \\dfrac{50}{20} = 2.5 \\cdot \\dfrac{C_{F,2}}{C_{F,1}}$.",
          "Step 4: At 20 bar, the nozzle is optimally expanded: $P_e = P_a = 1$ bar. At 50 bar with the same nozzle and same ambient (1 bar), $P_e/P_c$ becomes smaller (exit pressure lower relative to chamber), so the flow is more expanded and underexpanded at the exit.",
          "Step 5: From the thrust coefficient formula, decreasing $P_e/P_c$ (with fixed $P_a$ and $A_e/A_t$) increases the momentum term and also increases the pressure term, so overall $C_F$ increases: $C_{F,2} > C_{F,1}$. Hence $C_{F,2}/C_{F,1} > 1$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute this inequality into the thrust ratio: $F_2/F_1 = 2.5 \\cdot (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1}) > 2.5$. Therefore statements B and D are correct."
