        "reasoning": "Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms to form new molecules. According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass and the total number of atoms of each element (and thus the total number of all atoms) are always conserved. However, the total number of molecules (or moles) is generally NOT conserved. For example, in the reaction $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$, three reactant molecules (two $H_2$ and one $O_2$) combine to form two product molecules ($H_2O$). Here, the number of molecules changes from 3 to 2. The retrieved knowledge explicitly states: 'In chemical reactions, the total number of *atoms* of each element and the *total mass* are conserved. However, the *total number of moles* is generally *not* conserved.'"

          "Step 2: Recall the Law of Conservation of Mass. This fundamental law states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. This directly validates option D.",
          "Step 3: Extend the Law of Conservation of Mass to atoms. Since mass is conserved, and atoms are the fundamental units that make up molecules, the total number of atoms of each individual element (e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen) must remain constant before and after the reaction. This validates option C. Consequently, the total number of all atoms combined is also conserved, validating option A.",
          "Step 4: Consider the conservation of molecules (or moles). Chemical reactions involve the breaking of existing chemical bonds and the formation of new ones, leading to the rearrangement of atoms into different molecular structures. This rearrangement often results in a change in the total number of distinct molecular entities.",
          "Step 5: Test option B with an example. For instance, consider the combustion of hydrogen: $2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2H_2O(g)$. On the reactant side, there are 2 molecules of hydrogen and 1 molecule of oxygen, totaling 3 molecules. On the product side, there are 2 molecules of water. The total number of molecules changes from 3 to 2. This demonstrates that the total number of molecules is NOT always conserved.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that among the given options, 'Total number of molecules is conserved' is the statement that is NOT always true for a combustion process."
