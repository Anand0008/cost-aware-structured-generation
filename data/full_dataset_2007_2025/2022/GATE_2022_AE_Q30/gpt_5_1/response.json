        "reasoning": "The problem is about extreme loading mismatch and stall/surge risk in a high-pressure-ratio multistage axial compressor during starting, i.e., severe off-design operation. From the RAG context and standard gas-turbine texts: (1) Variable stator vanes (B) are explicitly used to adjust stator exit flow angle and maintain proper incidence on rotor blades at off-design conditions, preventing stall. (2) Blow-off (bleed) valves (C) are used to dump some air from intermediate stages during start and acceleration, reducing rear-stage mass flow and pressure ratio, thereby avoiding surge and loading mismatch. (3) Multi-spool shafts (D) allow different compressor sections (LPC, HPC) to rotate at different speeds, so each operates closer to its stable operating line during transients, reducing mismatch. All three are standard compressor control techniques for starting and off-design operation. Blade cooling (A) is a turbine thermal-protection measure; it does not address aerodynamic loading mismatch or stall in the compressor. Therefore B, C, and D are correct, A is not."
