        "reasoning": "The problem concerns a high-pressure-ratio multistage axial compressor during starting, where low rotor speeds cause a severe mismatch between the required and actual pressure rise, leading to stall/surge. Techniques to alleviate this are methods that adjust the compressor's operating point or characteristics to match the low-speed condition. Based on standard gas turbine propulsion knowledge and the RAG context: (B) Variable angle stator vanes adjust the inlet flow angle to maintain proper incidence on rotor blades, preventing stall. (C) Blow-off valves (or air bleed valves) release air from intermediate stages, reducing the mass flow and pressure rise demanded of the rear stages, thus preventing choking and unloading the compressor. (D) Multi-spool shaft allows different sections (e.g., LP and HP spools) to rotate at different speeds; during start, the LP spool can accelerate faster, reducing the loading mismatch on the HP spool. (A) Blade cooling is a thermal management technique for turbine blades in hot sections and is irrelevant to compressor aerodynamic loading during starting."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem context. During engine starting, the rotor speed is low. For a high-pressure-ratio compressor, the designed pressure rise per stage is matched to a high rotational speed. At low speed, the compressor's operating point shifts towards stall (the compressor map shows the stall line is approached at low corrected speeds). This creates an 'extreme loading mismatch' where the compressor cannot deliver the pressure rise required by the system, leading to stall or surge.",
          "Step 2: Recall the primary strategies for managing off-design compressor operation, especially at low speeds. The three main techniques are: (1) Variable geometry (stator vanes), (2) Air extraction (bleed or blow-off valves), and (3) Multi-spool (independent shaft speeds).",
          "Step 3: Evaluate each option against these strategies. Option A (Blade cooling) is used in turbines to allow higher inlet temperatures, not for compressor aerodynamic control during start. It is irrelevant.",
          "Step 4: Option B (Variable angle stator vanes) is correct. By adjusting the stator vane angle, the absolute flow angle ($\\alpha_2$) into the rotor is changed. This alters the relative velocity vector ($C_2 = V_2 - U$) to maintain a proper incidence angle on the rotor blade, preventing stall. This is a direct and common method for handling off-design operation.",
          "Step 5: Option C (Blow-off valves) is correct. These valves (also called bleed valves) open during starting to vent air overboard from an intermediate compressor stage. This reduces the mass flow through the rear stages, lowering their pressure rise requirement and axial velocity ($V_x$), thus moving the operating point away from stall. It 'unloads' the compressor.",
          "Step 6: Option D (Multi-spool shaft) is correct. In a multi-spool engine (e.g., two-spool), the low-pressure (LP) compressor and high-pressure (HP) compressor are on separate shafts. During start, the LP spool can accelerate more quickly than the HP spool. This allows each compressor section to operate closer to its optimal speed, reducing the mismatch between stage loading and available blade speed ($U$). The RAG context explicitly links multi-spool design to improved off-design stability.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that options B, C, and D are valid techniques, while A is not."
