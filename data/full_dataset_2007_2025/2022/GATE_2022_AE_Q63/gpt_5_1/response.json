Choose generalized coordinates: vertical translation of the center y and small rotation \\(\\theta\\) about the center (positive counterclockwise). For small motion, vertical displacement of left and right ends are \\(y - (l/2)\\theta\\) and \\(y + (l/2)\\theta\\). Spring forces (upward) are \\(k(y - l\\theta/2)\\) and \\(k(y + l\\theta/2)\\). Total potential energy: \\(V = \\tfrac{1}{2}k(y - l\\theta/2)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}k(y + l\\theta/2)^2 = k y^2 + k l^2 \\theta^2/4\\). Kinetic energy: \\(T = \\tfrac{1}{2} m \\dot y^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} I_c \\dot \\theta^2\\) with \\(I_c = m l^2/12\\) for a slender bar about its center. Thus mass matrix is diagonal: \\(M = \\text{diag}(m, m l^2/12)\\), stiffness matrix \\(K = \\text{diag}(2k, k l^2/2)\\). The eigenvalue problem \\(|K - \\omega^2 M| = 0\\) gives two uncoupled frequencies: \\(\\omega_1^2 = 2k/m\\) (pure vertical translation, mode I) and \\(\\omega_2^2 = (k l^2/2)/(m l^2/12) = 6k/m\\) (pure rotation, mode II). Therefore \\(\\omega_2/\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{6k/m} / \\sqrt{2k/m} = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\). Rounded to one decimal place, this is 1.7, which lies in the official answer range 1.7 to 1.8."
