The unshaded area in 'case N' is the area of the square sheet (1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cm^2) minus the area of the 9 shaded circles, which is 9 * (π * r^2).\n\nThe ratio of the unshaded areas is:\nUnshaded area in 'case M' / Unshaded area in 'case N' = (1 cm^2 - 4 * π * r^2) / (1 cm^2 - 9 * π * r^2) = 1 : 1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 : 1."
