This is because the Fanno curve represents the locus of all possible thermodynamic states for one-dimensional, steady, adiabatic flow with friction in a constant-area duct. As the flow progresses along the duct, friction causes the entropy to increase, and the flow state moves along the Fanno curve towards the point of maximum entropy, which occurs at the sonic condition (M=1). Therefore, the correct answer is C."
