The maximum principal stress 'σ_1' can be calculated using the formula:\n   σ_1 = (σ_x + σ_y)/2 + sqrt(((σ_x - σ_y)/2)^2 + τ_xy^2)\n   where:\n   σ_x = Axial stress = (7.4 kN) / (π * (2 cm)^2) = 11.78 MPa\n   σ_y = Circumferential stress = (148 Nm * 2 cm) / (π * (2 cm)^3 / 4) = 59.17 MPa\n   τ_xy = Shear stress = (148 Nm * 2 cm) / (π * (2 cm)^3 / 2) = 29.58 MPa\n4.
