        "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the minimum thickness of a thin-walled circular shaft subjected to an axial load and a torque, based on the maximum principal stress criterion. First, the axial normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) and torsional shear stress ($\\tau_{xy}$) are calculated using formulas appropriate for thin-walled sections. Since there is no internal pressure or bending, the circumferential normal stress ($\\sigma_y$) is zero. These stress components are then used in the formula for maximum principal stress ($\\sigma_1$). By equating this calculated $\\sigma_1$ to the allowable stress (100 MPa), the required thickness 't' is found. The calculation yields $t \\approx 0.9528$ mm, which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is 1 mm."

          "Step 2: Calculate the axial normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) due to the axial load. For a thin-walled circular shaft, the cross-sectional area is approximated as $A = 2 \\pi R t$. Thus, $\\sigma_x = P / (2 \\pi R t)$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the torsional shear stress ($\\tau_{xy}$) due to the applied torque. For a thin-walled circular shaft, the shear stress is given by $\\tau_{xy} = T / (2 A_m t)$, where $A_m = \\pi R^2$ is the area enclosed by the mean radius. So, $\\tau_{xy} = T / (2 \\pi R^2 t)$.",
          "Step 4: Determine other normal stress components. Since there is no internal pressure or bending moment, the circumferential normal stress ($\\sigma_y$) is zero.",
          "Step 5: Apply the maximum principal stress criterion. The maximum principal stress ($\\sigma_1$) for a 2D stress state $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy})$ is given by the formula: $\\sigma_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the expressions for $\\sigma_x$, $\\tau_{xy}$, and $\\sigma_y = 0$ into the principal stress formula and equate it to the allowable stress $\\sigma_{1,allow}$. This will result in an equation with 't' as the only unknown.",
          "Step 7: Perform the numerical calculations: \\ $\\sigma_x = 7400 / (2 \\pi \\times 20 \\times t) = 185 / (\\pi t)$ \\ $\\tau_{xy} = (148 \\times 10^3) / (2 \\pi \\times (20)^2 \\times t) = 148 \\times 10^3 / (800 \\pi t) = 185 / (\\pi t)$ \\ Notice that $\\sigma_x = \\tau_{xy}$.

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 5, and 6 were highly relevant, providing excellent context on combined stress theory, the maximum principal stress criterion, and examples involving combined axial load and torsion on thin-walled structures. This directly supported the methodology required for the problem. The specific formulas for thin-walled shaft area and torsional shear stress were derived from general principles but were consistent with the RAG's conceptual framework."

The allowable stress under uniaxial tension is 100 MPa. Using maximum principal stress criterion, the minimum thickness, t, of the shaft so that it does not fail is _____ mm (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
