          "description": "Instead of directly using the algebraic principal stress formula, plot the stress state (\\(\\sigma_x, \\tau_{xy}\\)) on Mohr's circle with \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\). The maximum principal stress is the rightmost point on the circle. Express its value in terms of t, equate to allowable stress, and solve for t.",

          "when_to_use": "Useful when first learning principal stresses or when asked to sketch Mohr's circle explicitly."
