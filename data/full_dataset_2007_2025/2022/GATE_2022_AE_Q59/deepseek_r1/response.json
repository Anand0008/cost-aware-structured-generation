These cover similar concepts (principal stress criteria, stress superposition) but not the exact thin-walled shaft under axial and torsion. The RAG context was moderately relevant for methodology but not for specific thin-walled formulas. Internal knowledge was used for the thin-walled approximations and exact solution."

The allowable stress under uniaxial tension is 100 MPa. Using maximum principal stress criterion, the minimum thickness, t, of the shaft so that it does not fail is _____ mm (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
