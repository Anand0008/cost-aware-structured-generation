          "name": "Approximation for small damping ratio",
          "description": "For very small damping ratios ($\\zeta \\ll 1$), the formula $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}}$ can be approximated as $\\delta \\approx 2\\pi\\zeta$. This simplifies solving for $\\zeta$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Much simpler algebra. Cons: Introduces approximation error. Only valid for small $\\zeta$. In this problem, $\\zeta \\approx 0.06$, so the approximation would yield $\\zeta = \\delta / (2\\pi) = 0.405465 / (2\\pi) \\approx 0.0645$, which is very close to the exact value. This would give $c \\approx 20.42 \\text{ Ns/m}$.",
          "when_to_use": "When the problem statement implies very light damping or if you are short on time and need a quick estimate, and the options are sufficiently spread out. Always verify if the approximation is justified by the calculated $\\zeta$ value."
