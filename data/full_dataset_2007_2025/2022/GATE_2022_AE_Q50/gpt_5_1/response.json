First, check if the flow can be steady and inviscid with a pressure field that satisfies Euler's equation. For steady, incompressible, inviscid flow without body forces, Euler's equation in vector form is \\(\\\\rho (\\\\vec{V} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla) \\\\vec{V} = - \\\\nabla p\\). Compute the convective acceleration components: \\\\n(1) Velocity components: \\(u = a y, \\\\ v = b x\\). \\\\n(2) Acceleration components: \\\\n\\\\(a_x = u \\\\partial u/\\\\partial x + v \\\\partial u/\\\\partial y = (a y) \\\\cdot 0 + (b x) \\\\cdot a = a b x\\\\). \\\\n\\\\(a_y = u \\\\partial v/\\\\partial x + v \\\\partial v/\\\\partial y = (a y) \\\\cdot b + (b x) \\\\cdot 0 = a b y\\\\). \\\\nThus \\(\\\\vec{a} = a b x \\\\hat{i} + a b y \\\\hat{j}\\\\). With density \\(\\\\rho = 1\\\\,\\\\text{kg/m}^3\\\\), Euler's equation gives: \\\\n\\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} = - \\\\rho a_x = - a b x, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} = - \\\\rho a_y = - a b y.\\\\) \\\\nSubstitute \\(a = 10, b = 20\\\\): \\(a b = 200\\\\). So \\\\n\\\\(\\\\partial p/\\\\partial x = -200 x, \\\\quad \\\\partial p/\\\\partial y = -200 y.\\\\) \\\\nIntegrate with respect to x: \\\\n\\\\(p(x,y) = -100 x^2 + f(y)\\\\). \\\\nDifferentiate this with respect to y and equate to \\(-200 y\\\\): \\\\n\\\\(\\\\partial p/\\\\partial y = f'(y) = -200 y \\\\Rightarrow f(y) = -100 y^2 + C.\\\\) \\\\nSo the pressure field is \\\\n\\\\(p(x,y) = -100 x^2 - 100 y^2 + C.\\\\) \\\\nUse the reference condition at (0,0): \\(p(0,0) = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} = 100000\\\\,\\\\text{Pa}\\\\). This gives \\(C = 100000\\\\). Therefore, \\\\n\\\\(p(x,y) = 100000 - 100(x^2 + y^2)\\\\) in Pa. \\\\nAt (x,y) = (6,8): \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\\\\). Then \\\\n\\\\(p(6,8) = 100000 - 100 \\\\times 100 = 100000 - 10000 = 90000\\\\,\\\\text{Pa} = 90\\\\,\\\\text{kPa}.\\\\) \\\\nRounded to nearest integer, this is 90 kPa, which lies within the official answer range 88 to 91 kPa.
