Calculate the velocity magnitude at (6 m, 8 m) using the given velocity field: V = sqrt((10*8)^2 + (20*6)^2) = 220 m/s.\n2. Use the Bernoulli equation to relate the pressure at (0 m, 0 m) and (6 m, 8 m): p + 0.5ρV^2 = constant.\n3. Plugging in the given pressure of 100 kPa at (0 m, 0 m) and the calculated velocity, we get p = 100 - 0.5*1.0*(220)^2/1000 = 88.56 kPa at (6 m, 8 m).\nRounding this to the nearest integer gives the answer of 89 kPa, which is within the correct range of 88 to 91 kPa."
