        "reasoning": "The problem involves a steady, incompressible, inviscid flow without gravity, described by a given velocity field. Since the flow is rotational (as shown by calculating vorticity), the simple Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied across streamlines. Instead, the differential form of Euler's equations must be used to determine the pressure distribution. By substituting the velocity components and their derivatives into Euler's equations, expressions for the pressure gradients ($\\partial p / \\partial x$ and $\\partial p / \\partial y$) are obtained. Integrating these expressions yields a general form for $p(x,y)$, which is then solved for the constant of integration using the given pressure at $(0,0)$. Finally, substituting the coordinates $(6,8)$ into the derived pressure function gives the pressure at that point. The calculated value of 90 kPa falls within the specified range of 88 to 91 kPa."
