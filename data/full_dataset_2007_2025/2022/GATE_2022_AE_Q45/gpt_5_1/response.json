        "reasoning": "Straight, level, constant-velocity flight for a conventional airplane implies: (1) No bank: roll angle \\(\\phi = 0^\\circ\\) (otherwise lift vector tilts and would cause a turn or sideslip unless compensated). (2) No heading change: yaw angle \\(\\psi\\) can be constant; its absolute value does not affect straightness, but all options here use \\(\\psi = 0\\), so this is acceptable. (3) Constant altitude: flight-path angle \\(\\gamma = 0\\). For a conventional configuration (small angles), \\(\\gamma \\approx \\theta - \\alpha\\). Level flight thus requires \\(\\theta \\approx \\alpha\\). (4) No lateral motion: sideslip angle \\(\\beta = 0\\). Now check options:\n- Option A: \\(\\phi = 0, \\theta = 2^\\circ, \\psi = 0, \\alpha = 2^\\circ, \\beta = 0\\). This satisfies \\(\\phi = 0\\), \\(\\beta = 0\\), and \\(\\theta = \\alpha\\), so \\(\\gamma \\approx 0\\). This is consistent with straight, level, constant-velocity flight.\n- Option B: \\(\\phi = 5^\\circ\\) with \\(\\beta = 0\\). A nonzero bank angle with zero sideslip and no coordinated turn would not be straight, level flight; with \\(\\phi \\neq 0\\), the lift vector is tilted, so either the aircraft must be turning (not straight) or vertical force balance is lost (not level). Thus B is not acceptable.\n- Option C: \\(\\beta = 5^\\circ\\). Nonzero sideslip implies lateral velocity component; the aircraft is not aligned with its velocity vector, so it is not strictly straight flight in the usual trimmed sense for a conventional airplane.\n- Option D: \\(\\beta = 5^\\circ\\) again violates the no-sideslip condition; also \\(\\theta \\neq \\alpha\\), so \\(\\gamma \\neq 0\\). Hence only A is consistent with the given flight condition."

Use geometric angles to see that the angle between the velocity vector and horizontal (gamma) equals theta − alpha. Then enforce gamma = 0 for level flight.",
