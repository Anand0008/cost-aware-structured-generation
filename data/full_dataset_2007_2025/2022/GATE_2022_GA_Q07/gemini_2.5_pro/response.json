After today, the total number of days becomes `m + 1`, and the total production becomes `S_m + 180`.\\nThe new average daily production is given as 110 units/day. So, we can set up the second equation:\\n`$\\frac{S_m + 180}{m + 1} = 110$`\\nSubstitute `S_m = 100m` into the second equation:\\n`$\\frac{100m + 180}{m + 1} = 110$`\\nNow, solve for `m`:\\n`$100m + 180 = 110(m + 1)$`\\n`$100m + 180 = 110m + 110$`\\nSubtract `100m` from both sides:\\n`$180 = 10m + 110$`\\nSubtract `110` from both sides:\\n`$180 - 110 = 10m$`\\n`$70 = 10m$`\\nDivide by `10`:\\n`$m = 7$`\\nThus, the value of `m` is 7, which corresponds to option C."

          "Step 1: Define the initial total production. Let `m` be the number of past days and `S_m` be the total production over these `m` days. The initial average is given as 100 units/day. So, `$\\frac{S_m}{m} = 100$`, which implies `S_m = 100m`.",
          "Step 2: Account for today's production. Today's production is 180 units. The total number of days now becomes `m + 1`. The new total production is `S_m + 180`.",
          "Step 3: Formulate the new average production equation. The new average daily production is given as 110 units/day. So, `$\\frac{S_m + 180}{m + 1} = 110$`.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the expression for `S_m` from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3. This gives `$\\frac{100m + 180}{m + 1} = 110$`.",
          "Step 5: Solve the resulting algebraic equation for `m`. Multiply both sides by `(m + 1)`: `100m + 180 = 110(m + 1)`. Expand the right side: `100m + 180 = 110m + 110`. Rearrange the terms to solve for `m`: `180 - 110 = 110m - 100m`, which simplifies to `70 = 10m`. Finally, `m = 7`."
