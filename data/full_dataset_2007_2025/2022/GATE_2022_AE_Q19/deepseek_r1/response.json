Its contribution to the pitching moment derivative with respect to angle of attack, C_m_alpha_tail, is given by $Cm_{\\alpha_{tail}} = -\\eta V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}}(1 - \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\alpha})$. All terms in this expression ($\\eta$, $V_H$, $C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}}$, $(1 - d\\epsilon/d\\alpha)$) are typically positive, resulting in a negative (stabilizing) value for C_m_alpha_tail. This directly contradicts options B and C. While the tail can be designed to provide a positive or negative C_m0 via the setting angle i_t (option D mentions C_m0 > 0, which is possible), its C_m_alpha contribution remains negative for a conventional, stable aircraft."

          "Step 3: Characterize each component's typical sign. The wing contribution depends on CG location relative to the wing's aerodynamic center (AC) and can be positive or negative. The fuselage contribution is typically positive (destabilizing). The horizontal tail contribution is designed to be negative (stabilizing) to ensure the overall aircraft C_m_alpha < 0.",

Here, $\\eta$ (dynamic pressure ratio) > 0, $V_H$ (tail volume ratio) > 0, $C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}}$ (tail lift curve slope) > 0, and $(1 - d\\epsilon/d\\alpha)$ is usually positive (as $d\\epsilon/d\\alpha$ is between ~0.3 and 0.5). Therefore, the product is negative.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the options. Option A (contributes to C_m_alpha < 0) is true and is the primary role of the tail. Option B and C are false. Option D is partially false because while C_m0_tail can be >0, C_m_alpha_tail is not >0."
