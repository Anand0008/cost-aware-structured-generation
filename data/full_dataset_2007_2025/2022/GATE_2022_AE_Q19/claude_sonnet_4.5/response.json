This is because the tail generates a stabilizing nose-down pitching moment when the aircraft's angle of attack increases, which helps restore the aircraft to its equilibrium position. The retrieved knowledge from the video lectures and textbook references clearly demonstrates this stabilizing effect of the horizontal tail, confirming that option A is the correct answer."
