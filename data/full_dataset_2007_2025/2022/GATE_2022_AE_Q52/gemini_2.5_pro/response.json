        "reasoning": "The problem describes a scenario analogous to Couette flow in an annular gap. The key assumption provided is a linear velocity profile in the vertical gap. This allows direct calculation of shear stress. First, the tangential velocity of the inner cylinder surface is calculated using its radius and angular speed. Then, the shear stress is determined using Newton's law of viscosity and the given gap width. This shear stress acts over the cylindrical surface area of the inner cylinder, generating a shear force. Finally, the driving moment (torque) is found by multiplying this force by the radius of the inner cylinder. All steps are consistent with fundamental fluid mechanics principles and the provided RAG context on Couette flow."
