          "**Step 1: Identify the given information and the required output.** The question provides the glide angle ($\\gamma = 10^\\circ$) of an unpowered glider and asks for its lift-to-drag ratio (L/D).",
          "**Step 2: Recall the fundamental principle of unpowered gliding flight.** In a steady, unaccelerated glide, the forces of lift (L), drag (D), and weight (W) are in equilibrium. There is no thrust. The aircraft descends at a constant angle relative to the horizontal.",
          "**Step 3: State the governing equation relating glide angle and L/D ratio.** From force equilibrium analysis (resolving forces parallel and perpendicular to the flight path), it is established that the tangent of the glide angle is equal to the drag-to-lift ratio, or conversely, the lift-to-drag ratio is the reciprocal of the tangent of the glide angle: $L/D = 1 / \\tan(\\gamma)$.",
          "**Step 4: Substitute the given glide angle into the formula.** Ensure that the calculator is set to degree mode for trigonometric functions, as the angle is given in degrees: $L/D = 1 / \\tan(10^\\circ)$.",
          "**Step 5: Perform the numerical calculation.** Calculate the value of $\\tan(10^\\circ)$ and then divide 1 by this value. $\\tan(10^\\circ) \\approx 0.17632698$. Therefore, $L/D \\approx 1 / 0.17632698 \\approx 5.67128$.",
          "**Step 6: Round the final answer to the specified number of decimal places.** The question asks to round off to two decimal places. Thus, $L/D \\approx 5.67$."
