This occurs about the axis parallel to 'w', for which the moment of inertia is $I_{min} = \\frac{1}{12} w t^3$.\n    Substituting these values into Euler's formula:\n    $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times (70 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2) \\times (\\frac{1}{12} w t^3 \\text{ mm}^4)}{(1000 \\text{ mm})^2}$\n    $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times 10^3 \\times w t^3}{12 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times w t^3}{12 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times w t^3}{12000} \\quad (2)$\n\n3.  **Equating P_y and P_cr:**\n    To find the value of 't' where failure by yielding and buckling coincide, we set $P_y = P_{cr}$:\n    $120 \\times w \\times t = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times w t^3}{12000}$\n\n4.  **Solve for t:**\n    Divide both sides by $w \\times t$ (assuming $w, t \\neq 0$):\n    $120 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times t^2}{12000}$\n    Rearrange to solve for $t^2$:\n    $t^2 = \\frac{120 \\times 12000}{\\pi^2 \\times 70}$\n    $t^2 = \\frac{1440000}{9.8696 \\times 70} = \\frac{1440000}{690.872}$\n    $t^2 \\approx 2084.28 \\text{ mm}^2$\n    $t = \\sqrt{2084.28} \\approx 45.654 \\text{ mm}$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, $t \\approx 45.65 \\text{ mm}$.

          "description": "Instead of equating loads, one could equate the critical buckling stress ($\\sigma_{cr} = P_{cr}/A$) to the yield stress ($\\sigma_y$). This leads to the same result but emphasizes the critical stress concept. The critical stress for Euler buckling is $\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{(L_e/r_{min})^2}$, where $r_{min}$ is the minimum radius of gyration ($r_{min} = \\sqrt{I_{min}/A}$). Equating $\\sigma_{cr} = \\sigma_y$ would directly give the slenderness ratio at which both failure modes coincide.",
