        "reasoning": "The problem describes a steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow over a non-porous flat plate within a control volume PQRS. The core principle to solve this is the conservation of mass, which for incompressible flow simplifies to the conservation of volume flow rate. This means the total volume flow rate entering the control volume must equal the total volume flow rate leaving it.\n\nLet's analyze the flow through each section of the control volume:\n1.  **Section PQ (Inlet):** The flow enters the control volume. The velocity is uniform, $u_{\\infty}$, over a height $h$. The volume flow rate into the control volume through PQ is:\n    $$Q_{PQ} = u_{\\infty} \\times h$$\n2.  **Section RS (Outlet):** The flow leaves the control volume. The velocity profile is given by $u(y) = A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n$ over the height $h$. To find the total volume flow rate out of the control volume through RS, we must integrate the velocity profile over the height:\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\int_{0}^{h} u(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{h} A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n dy$$\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\int_{0}^{h} y^n dy = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left[\\frac{y^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right]_{0}^{h}$$\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left(\\frac{h^{n+1}}{n+1} - 0\\right) = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$$\n3.  **Section QR (Bottom - Flat Plate):** The problem states it's a non-porous flat plate. This implies no fluid can pass through this boundary. Therefore, the volume flow rate through QR is:\n    $$Q_{QR} = 0$$\n4.  **Section PS (Top Boundary):** The problem explicitly states that the flow through section PS will vanish. This means the volume flow rate through PS is:\n    $$Q_{PS} = 0$$\n\nNow, applying the principle of conservation of volume flow rate for the control volume PQRS (Total flow in = Total flow out):\n$$Q_{PQ} + Q_{QR} = Q_{RS} + Q_{PS}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given flow rates:\n$$u_{\\infty} h + 0 = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1} + 0$$\n$$u_{\\infty} h = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$$\nSince $h$ is a non-zero height, we can divide both sides by $h$:\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{A_0}{n+1}$$\nFinally, solving for $A_0$:\n$$A_0 = u_{\\infty} (n+1)$$\nThis result matches option B."
