        "reasoning": "The analysis confirms the answer key. For an isentropic multistage axial compressor with constant work coefficient per stage, the specific work per stage is w = ψU² = CpΔT_s. Computing ΔT_s = (0.55 * 245²)/1005 ≈ 32.85 K. The overall isentropic temperature ratio needed for pressure ratio 5 is (T_out/T_in) = 5^((γ-1)/γ) ≈ 1.584, giving ΔT_total = 300*(1.584-1) ≈ 175.2 K. Number of stages N ≥ ΔT_total/ΔT_s ≈ 5.33, so rounding up gives 6 stages."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the given parameters: Inlet P1=1 atm, T1=300 K, exit P2≥5 atm, mean blade speed U=245 m/s, work coefficient ψ = ΔCθ/U = 0.55, air properties Cp=1005 J/(kg·K), R=287 J/(kg·K), γ=1.4. Compression is isentropic.",
          "Step 2: Relate work coefficient to specific work input per stage. The Euler work equation for a stage gives specific work: w = UΔCθ = ψU² = 0.55 * (245)² = 0.55 * 60025 = 33013.75 J/kg.",
          "Step 3: For an isentropic stage, the specific work equals the isentropic enthalpy rise: w = Cp ΔT_s, where ΔT_s is the isentropic temperature rise per stage. Thus, ΔT_s = w / Cp = 33013.75 / 1005 ≈ 32.8495 K.",
          "Step 4: Determine the overall temperature rise required for an isentropic compression from 1 atm to 5 atm. Using the isentropic relation: T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ) = 5^(0.4/1.4) = 5^(2/7) ≈ 1.5846. Hence, T2 = 300 * 1.5846 ≈ 475.38 K. The overall temperature rise ΔT_total = 475.38 - 300 = 175.38 K.",
          "Step 5: Since each stage provides approximately the same ΔT_s (because w and Cp are constant), the number of stages needed is N = ΔT_total / ΔT_s ≈ 175.38 / 32.8495 ≈ 5.34.",
          "Step 6: The number of stages must be an integer, and the exit pressure must be at least 5 atm, so we round up to the next higher integer. Therefore, N = 6 stages."

    "question_text": "A multistage axial compressor takes in air at 1 atm, 300 K and compresses it to a minimum of 5 atm. The mean blade speed is 245 m/s and work coefficient, Delta C_theta / U is 0.55 for each stage. For air, use Cp =1005 J/(kg-K), R = 287 J/(kg-K) and gamma = 1.4. If the compression is isentropic, the number of stages required is ___________ (rounded off to the next higher integer)."
