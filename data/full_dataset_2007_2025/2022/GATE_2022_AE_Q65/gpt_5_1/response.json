        "reasoning": "For an isentropic multistage axial compressor with constant work coefficient, each stage adds the same specific work: $w_s = U \\Delta C_\\theta = U^2 \\psi$, where $\\psi = \\Delta C_\\theta/U$ is the work coefficient. Given $U = 245\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $\\psi = 0.55$, the stagnation temperature rise per stage is $\\Delta T_{0,\\text{stage}} = w_s/C_p = U^2 \\psi / C_p$. Numerically, $U^2 = 245^2 = 60025$, so $w_s = 60025 \\times 0.55 \\approx 33013.75\\,\\text{J/kg}$ and $\\Delta T_{0,\\text{stage}} = 33013.75/1005 \\approx 32.8\\,\\text{K}$. For isentropic compression of air, the overall pressure ratio is $\\pi_c = (p_{0,\\text{out}}/p_{0,\\text{in}}) = (T_{0,\\text{out}}/T_{0,\\text{in}})^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$. With inlet $T_{0,1} = 300\\,\\text{K}$ and $N$ identical stages, $T_{0,\\text{out}} = 300 + N\\,\\Delta T_{0,\\text{stage}}$. Required overall pressure ratio is $5$ (from 1 atm to 5 atm). Thus $5 = \\left(\\dfrac{300 + N\\,32.8}{300}\\right)^{3.5}$. Taking $1/3.5$ power: $5^{1/3.5} \\approx 1.584$. So $\\dfrac{300 + 32.8N}{300} = 1.584 \\Rightarrow 300 + 32.8N = 475.2 \\Rightarrow 32.8N = 175.2 \\Rightarrow N \\approx 5.34$. Since you cannot have a fraction of a stage and the question explicitly asks to round off to the next higher integer, the required number of stages is $6$. This matches the official key (\"6 or greater than 6\")."

          "description": "Instead of working with temperature, compute the stage pressure ratio directly from the stage temperature rise: first find $\\Delta T_0$ per stage, then for each stage use $\\pi_s = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{\\Delta T_0}{T_{0,\\text{stage,in}}}\\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$ and multiply stage pressure ratios until the product reaches 5. This may require iteration because $T_{0,\\text{stage,in}}$ increases from stage to stage.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Gives detailed view of how stage pressure ratio changes as inlet temperature increases. Cons: More computationally intensive and iterative; not needed when a direct overall temperature ratio approach is available.",
          "when_to_use": "Useful when stage inlet temperature variations are important or when stage loading is not constant."

Internal knowledge was used to adapt these to a multistage, isentropic-compression context and to compute the number of stages."
