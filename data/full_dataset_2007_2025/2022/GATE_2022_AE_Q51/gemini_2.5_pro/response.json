        "reasoning": "The total lift (L) generated by a finite wing is calculated by integrating the lift per unit span (L') over the entire wingspan. The lift per unit span is given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem: $L'(y) = \\rho U_\\infty \\Gamma(y)$. Therefore, the total lift is $L = \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} L'(y) dy = \\rho U_\\infty \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy$. The given circulation distribution is $ \\Gamma(y) = \\Gamma_0 (1 - 2y/b) $ for $0 \\le y \\le b/2$ and $ \\Gamma_0 (1 + 2y/b) $ for $-b/2 \\le y \\le 0$. This describes a triangular distribution, symmetric about $y=0$, with a maximum circulation $ \\Gamma_0 $ at the wing root ($y=0$) and zero circulation at the wingtips ($y = \\pm b/2$). The integral $ \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy $ represents the area under this triangular circulation distribution. The area of a triangle is given by $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} $. In this case, the base is the wingspan $b$ and the height is the maximum circulation $ \\Gamma_0 $. Thus, $ \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy = \\frac{1}{2} b \\Gamma_0 $. Substituting this into the total lift formula: $L = \\rho U_\\infty (\\frac{1}{2} b \\Gamma_0)$. Given values are: $ \\rho = 1.2 \\text{ kg/m}^3 $, $ U_\\infty = 80 \\text{ m/s} $, $ b = 10 \\text{ m} $, and $ \\Gamma_0 = 20 \\text{ m}^2/s $. Plugging these values: $L = 1.2 \\times 80 \\times (\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 20) = 1.2 \\times 80 \\times (100) = 9600 \\text{ N}$. This calculated value of 9600 N falls within the specified correct answer range of 9500 to 9800 N."

The wingspan b is 10 m, the maximum circulation Gamma0 is 20 m^2/s, density of air is 1.2 kg/m^3 and the free stream speed is 80 m/s. The lift over the wing is ______N (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
