Total lift is $L = \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} L'(y)\\,dy = \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y)\\,dy$. The given circulation distribution is piecewise linear and symmetric: for $0 \\le y \\le b/2$, $\\Gamma(y) = \\Gamma_0(1 - 2y/b)$; for $-b/2 \\le y \\le 0$, $\\Gamma(y) = \\Gamma_0(1 + 2y/b)$. Because of symmetry, $\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y)\\,dy = 2\\int_0^{b/2} \\Gamma_0(1 - 2y/b)\\,dy$. Evaluating: $\\int_0^{b/2} (1 - 2y/b)\\,dy = [y - y^2/b]_0^{b/2} = b/4$. Thus $\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y)\\,dy = 2\\Gamma_0 (b/4) = \\Gamma_0 b/2$. Therefore $L = \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty (\\Gamma_0 b/2)$.
