The PDE becomes \\(a''(x)b(y) + a(x)b''(y) = 0\\). Dividing by \\(a(x)b(y)\\) (assuming nonzero), we get \\(\\frac{a''(x)}{a(x)} + \\frac{b''(y)}{b(y)} = 0\\). The first term depends only on \\(x\\), the second only on \\(y\\), so each must be a constant: \\(\\frac{a''}{a} = k\\), \\(\\frac{b''}{b} = -k\\). Thus \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy second-order ODEs with opposite signs of the separation constant. If \\(k>0\\), then \\(a'' = k a\\) has exponential solutions and \\(b'' = -k b\\) has sinusoidal (periodic) solutions. If \\(k<0\\), the roles reverse. If \\(k=0\\), both are linear. Therefore, one of \\(a,b\\) can be periodic and the other exponential, but they cannot both be exponential (that would require the same sign of \\(k\\) in both ODEs) nor both periodic (that would require both to have negative \\(k\\)). Option C (\\(a(x)\\) periodic, \\(b(y)\\) exponential) is consistent with \\(k<0\\). Option A (periodic and linear) would require \\(k=0\\) and \\(k<0\\) simultaneously, impossible. Option B (both exponential) would require \\(k>0\\) and \\(k<0\\) simultaneously. Option D (both periodic) would require \\(k<0\\) and \\(k>0\\) simultaneously. Hence only C can be true."
