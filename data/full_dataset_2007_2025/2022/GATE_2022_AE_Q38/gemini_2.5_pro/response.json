We are given a solution of the form $f(x, y) = a(x)b(y)$. Substituting this into the PDE:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2(a(x)b(y))}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2(a(x)b(y))}{\\partial y^2} = 0$\n$b(y)\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} + a(x)\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} = 0$\n\nDividing by $a(x)b(y)$ (assuming $a(x), b(y) \\neq 0$):\n\n$\\frac{1}{a(x)}\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{b(y)}\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} = 0$\n\nSince the first term depends only on $x$ and the second term depends only on $y$, for their sum to be zero, each term must be equal to a constant, but with opposite signs. Let's introduce a separation constant $\\lambda^2$ (or $-\\lambda^2$ or $0$).\n\n$\\frac{1}{a(x)}\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} = k$ and $\\frac{1}{b(y)}\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} = -k$\n\nThis leads to two ordinary differential equations:\n1. $\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} - ka = 0$\n2. $\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} + kb = 0$\n\nNow, we analyze the possible cases for the constant $k$:\n\n**Case 1: $k = \\lambda^2 > 0$ (positive constant)**\n*   For $a(x)$: $\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 a = 0$. The characteristic equation is $m^2 - \\lambda^2 = 0 \\implies m = \\pm \\lambda$. The solution is $a(x) = C_1 e^{\\lambda x} + C_2 e^{-\\lambda x}$, which is an exponential function.\n*   For $b(y)$: $\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} + \\lambda^2 b = 0$. The characteristic equation is $m^2 + \\lambda^2 = 0 \\implies m = \\pm i\\lambda$. The solution is $b(y) = C_3 \\cos(\\lambda y) + C_4 \\sin(\\lambda y)$, which is a periodic (trigonometric) function.\n    In this case, $a(x)$ is exponential and $b(y)$ is periodic.\n\n**Case 2: $k = -\\lambda^2 < 0$ (negative constant)**\n*   For $a(x)$: $\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} + \\lambda^2 a = 0$. The characteristic equation is $m^2 + \\lambda^2 = 0 \\implies m = \\pm i\\lambda$. The solution is $a(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$, which is a periodic (trigonometric) function.\n*   For $b(y)$: $\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} - \\lambda^2 b = 0$.

The solution is $b(y) = C_3 e^{\\lambda y} + C_4 e^{-\\lambda y}$, which is an exponential function.\n    In this case, $a(x)$ is periodic and $b(y)$ is exponential.\n\n**Case 3: $k = 0$**\n*   For $a(x)$: $\\frac{d^2a}{dx^2} = 0$. The solution is $a(x) = C_1 x + C_2$, which is a linear function.\n*   For $b(y)$: $\\frac{d^2b}{dy^2} = 0$. The solution is $b(y) = C_3 y + C_4$, which is a linear function.\n    In this case, both $a(x)$ and $b(y)$ are linear functions.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. $a(x)$ is a periodic function and $b(y)$ is a linear function.

(Not possible for a single consistent $k$)\nC. $a(x)$ is a periodic function and $b(y)$ is an exponential function. (This matches Case 2, where $k < 0$.
