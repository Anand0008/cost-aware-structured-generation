        "reasoning": "The calculation uses the fundamental thrust equations for turbofan streams, incorporating bypass ratio and fuel-to-air ratio, under the specified conditions of static test and no pressure thrust. The thrust from the core engine ($F_{core}$) is given by $(\\dot{m}_{a\\_core} + \\dot{m}_f) V_{eH}$ and the thrust from the fan stream ($F_{fan}$) is given by $\\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass} V_{eC}$. Using the definitions of fuel-to-air ratio ($f = \\dot{m}_f / \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$) and bypass ratio ($\\beta = \\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass} / \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$), these equations become $F_{core} = \\dot{m}_{a\\_core} (1 + f) V_{eH}$ and $F_{fan} = \\beta \\dot{m}_{a\\_core} V_{eC}$. The ratio of fan thrust to core thrust is then $\\frac{F_{fan}}{F_{core}} = \\frac{\\beta \\dot{m}_{a\\_core} V_{eC}}{\\dot{m}_{a\\_core} (1 + f) V_{eH}} = \\frac{\\beta V_{eC}}{(1 + f) V_{eH}}$. Substituting the given values: $\\beta = 9$, $V_{eH} = 1.5 V_{eC}$ (so $V_{eC}/V_{eH} = 1/1.5$), and $f = 0.03$, we get $\\frac{F_{fan}}{F_{core}} = \\frac{9 \\times (1/1.5)}{(1 + 0.03)} = \\frac{6}{1.03} \\approx 5.825$. Rounding to one decimal place gives 5.8. This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 5.7 to 6.0."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters from the problem statement: bypass ratio ($\\beta = 9$), relationship between core hot exhaust speed ($V_{eH}$) and fan exhaust speed ($V_{eC}$), which is $V_{eH} = 1.5 V_{eC}$, and fuel-to-air ratio ($f = 0.03$). Also note the conditions: static test ($V_a = 0$) and no pressure thrust ($P_e = P_a$).",
          "Step 2: Write down the simplified thrust equations for the core and fan streams under static, no pressure thrust conditions. The general thrust equation simplifies to momentum thrust only. For the core stream, fuel mass flow must be included: $F_{core} = (\\dot{m}_{a\\_core} + \\dot{m}_f) V_{eH}$. For the fan stream: $F_{fan} = \\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass} V_{eC}$.",
          "Step 3: Express the fuel mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) and bypass air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass}$) in terms of the core air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$) using the given ratios. From the fuel-to-air ratio definition, $f = \\dot{m}_f / \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$, so $\\dot{m}_f = f \\times \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$. From the bypass ratio definition, $\\beta = \\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass} / \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$, so $\\dot{m}_{a\\_bypass} = \\beta \\times \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute these expressions back into the thrust equations. The core thrust becomes $F_{core} = (\\dot{m}_{a\\_core} + f \\times \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}) V_{eH} = \\dot{m}_{a\\_core} (1 + f) V_{eH}$. The fan thrust becomes $F_{fan} = (\\beta \\times \\dot{m}_{a\\_core}) V_{eC}$.",
          "Step 5: Form the ratio of fan thrust to core thrust: $\\frac{F_{fan}}{F_{core}} = \\frac{\\beta \\times \\dot{m}_{a\\_core} \\times V_{eC}}{\\dot{m}_{a\\_core} (1 + f) V_{eH}}$.",
          "Step 6: Cancel out the common term $\\dot{m}_{a\\_core}$ from the numerator and denominator: $\\frac{F_{fan}}{F_{core}} = \\frac{\\beta V_{eC}}{(1 + f) V_{eH}}$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute the given numerical values: $\\beta = 9$, $f = 0.03$, and use the relationship $V_{eH} = 1.5 V_{eC}$, which implies $\\frac{V_{eC}}{V_{eH}} = \\frac{1}{1.5}$.",
          "Step 8: Calculate the final ratio: $\\frac{F_{fan}}{F_{core}} = \\frac{9 \\times (1/1.5)}{(1 + 0.03)} = \\frac{6}{1.03} \\approx 5.8252$. Round this value to one decimal place, which is 5.8."

The engine is operated at a fuel to air ratio of f = 0.03. Both the fan and the core streams have no pressure thrust. The ratio of fan thrust to thrust from the core engine is _____ (round off to one decimal place)."
