        "notes": "RAG context provided excellent foundational material on turbofan thrust equations, bypass ratio definition, and the concept of separate stream contributions. Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 directly covered the needed formulas. However, none explicitly solved for the thrust ratio given these specific parameters, so the numerical application relied on internal knowledge. Overall, RAG was highly relevant."

The engine is operated at a fuel to air ratio of f = 0.03. Both the fan and the core streams have no pressure thrust. The ratio of fan thrust to thrust from the core engine is _____ (round off to one decimal place)."
