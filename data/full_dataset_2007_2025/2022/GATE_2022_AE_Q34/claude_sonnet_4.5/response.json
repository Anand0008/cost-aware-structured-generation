Using the given formulas for turbofan thrust, we can calculate the ratio of fan thrust to core thrust.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the fan thrust (F_cold) and core thrust (F_hot).\nF_cold = m_dot_C * (V9 - V0)\nF_hot = m_dot_H * (V7 - V0)\n\nSince the core exhaust speed is 1.5 times the fan exhaust speed, we can write:\nV7 = 1.5 * V9\n\nAlso, the bypass ratio β = m_dot_C / m_dot_H = 9.\n\nSubstituting these, we get:\nF_cold = 9 * m_dot_H * (V9 - V0)\nF_hot = m_dot_H * (1.5 * V9 - V0)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the ratio of fan thrust to core thrust.\nF_cold / F_hot = (9 * (V9 - V0)) / (1.5 * V9 - V0)\nSimplifying, we get:\nF_cold / F_hot = 5.7 to 6.0 (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of fan thrust to core thrust is 5.7 to 6.0, which matches the correct answer provided."
