        "reasoning": "Consider a right circular cone inscribed in a sphere of radius R, with its vertex at the 'top' of the sphere and base inside the sphere. Let the cone height be h (measured along the sphere diameter through the vertex) and base radius be r. Place the sphere center at O and the cone vertex at the top point A on the sphere, so AO = R. The base center lies on AO at some distance x from O toward A, and the base radius r satisfies the right triangle relation from the sphere: r^2 + x^2 = R^2. The cone height is h = R + x (distance from vertex A to base plane). Eliminating x: x = h - R, so r^2 = R^2 - (h - R)^2 = R^2 - (h^2 - 2Rh + R^2) = 2Rh - h^2. Thus the cone volume is V = (1/3)\\pi r^2 h = (1/3)\\pi h(2Rh - h^2) = (\\pi/3)(2Rh^2 - h^3). Differentiate with respect to h and set to zero for maximum: dV/dh = (\\pi/3)(4Rh - 3h^2) = (\\pi h/3)(4R - 3h). Nontrivial extremum occurs at 4R - 3h = 0, giving h = 4R/3. This is within the allowable range (0 < h < 2R) and corresponds to a maximum (second derivative negative). Hence the height of the maximum-volume cone is 4R/3, which matches option C."

The specific inscribed-cone optimization was solved using internal knowledge; RAG was not directly needed but confirmed general methods for volume calculations involving spheres."
