From the question, $\\sigma_{xx} = 110 \\text{ MPa}$, $\\sigma_{yy} = 30 \\text{ MPa}$, $\\tau_{xy} = 40 \\text{ MPa}$. From the figure, the inclined plane is at $45^{\\circ}$ with the horizontal, and the normal stress $\\sigma_n$ acts perpendicular to this plane. Therefore, the angle $\\theta$ of the normal to the plane, measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis, is $45^{\\circ}$.",

The formula for normal stress $\\sigma_n$ (or $\\sigma_{x'x'}$) on a plane rotated by an angle $\\theta$ is: $\\sigma_n = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{xx} - \\sigma_{yy}}{2} \\cos(2\\theta) + \\tau_{xy} \\sin(2\\theta)$.",
