        "reasoning": "The nozzle is geometrically designed for an exit Mach number of 2.3. For a given geometry, the exit Mach number is fixed when the flow is perfectly expanded (no waves at exit). Thus, to eliminate the Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan at the exit, the static pressure at the nozzle exit must equal the ambient pressure while maintaining Mach 2.3. Using the isentropic relation for pressure ratio at M = 2.3 with \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\): \\(p_0/p_e = (1 + (\\gamma-1)M^2/2)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}\\). Substituting \\(M = 2.3\\) gives \\(1 + 0.2\\times 2.3^2 = 2.058\\), and raising to the power 3.5 gives approximately 12.1. For a perfectly expanded jet with \\(p_e = p_a = 1\\,\\text{bar}\\), the required reservoir pressure is therefore \\(p_{0,\\text{req}} \\approx 12.1\\,\\text{bar}\\). The current reservoir pressure is 25 bar, which causes underexpansion (exit pressure greater than ambient), hence the observed expansion waves. The minimum change in reservoir pressure to reach perfect expansion is \\(\\Delta p_0 = 12.1 - 25 \\approx -12.9\\,\\text{bar}\\). The percentage change relative to the original 25 bar is \\(|\\Delta p_0|/25 \\times 100 \\approx 51\\%\\). Since the question only asks for magnitude, GATE accepts 49-51\\%. Some solutions may express this as a negative percentage (pressure reduction), hence the alternative range -51 to -49\\%."

          "1. Recognize that the nozzle geometry is fixed and designed for an exit Mach number of \\(M_e = 2.3\\). For a given geometry and inviscid, adiabatic flow, the exit Mach number is determined solely by the area ratio, not by the reservoir pressure, as long as the flow is choked.",
          "2. To eliminate the Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves at the exit, the jet must be perfectly expanded: the static pressure at the nozzle exit must equal the ambient pressure, \\(p_e = p_a = 1\\,\\text{bar}\\). The Mach number at the exit remains 2.3 because the area ratio is unchanged.",
          "3. Use the isentropic pressure relation for compressible flow: \\(\\dfrac{p_0}{p} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2\\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma - 1)}\\). Here, \\(p_0\\) is the reservoir (stagnation) pressure and \\(p\\) is the static pressure at Mach \\(M\\).",
          "4. Substitute \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\) and \\(M = 2.3\\): first compute the bracket term: \\(1 + 0.2 M^2 = 1 + 0.2 \\times 2.3^2 = 1 + 0.2 \\times 5.29 = 1 + 1.058 = 2.058\\).",
          "5. Raise this to the power \\(\\gamma/(\\gamma-1) = 1.4/0.4 = 3.5\\): \\(2.058^{3.5} \\approx 12.1\\). Thus, for Mach 2.3, \\(p_0/p_e \\approx 12.1\\).",
          "6. For perfect expansion, \\(p_e = p_a = 1\\,\\text{bar}\\). Therefore the required reservoir pressure is \\(p_{0,\\text{req}} = 12.1 \\times 1\\,\\text{bar} \\approx 12.1\\,\\text{bar}\\).",
          "7. The current reservoir pressure is 25 bar. The change needed is \\(\\Delta p_0 = p_{0,\\text{req}} - p_{0,\\text{current}} = 12.1 - 25 = -12.9\\,\\text{bar}\\), i.e., a reduction of 12.9 bar.",
          "8. Compute the percentage change relative to the original 25 bar: \\(\\%\\,\\text{change} = \\dfrac{|\\Delta p_0|}{25} \\times 100 \\approx \\dfrac{12.9}{25} \\times 100 \\approx 51\\%\\). Rounding and table approximations give 49-51\\%, matching the official answer."

Flow through the nozzle is inviscid, the characteristic gas constant for air is 287 J/(kg-K), and gamma = 1.4. When the reservoir pressure is 25 bar (absolute), and temperature is 300 K, Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves appear at the nozzle exit as shown. The minimum percentage change in the reservoir pressure required to eliminate the wave system at the nozzle exit under steady state is _______%."
