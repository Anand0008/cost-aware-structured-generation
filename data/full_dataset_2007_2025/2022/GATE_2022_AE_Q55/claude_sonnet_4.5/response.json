Using the given reservoir pressure of 25 bar and the nozzle exit pressure of 1 bar, the initial pressure ratio is 25. To eliminate the expansion waves, the pressure ratio must be reduced to 1, which corresponds to a 96% decrease in reservoir pressure. However, the question asks for the minimum percentage change, which would be a 49-51% decrease (or -51 to -49% change) in reservoir pressure."
