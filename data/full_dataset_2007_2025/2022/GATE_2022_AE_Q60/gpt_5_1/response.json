        "reasoning": "The 10 kN load applied with eccentricity e on a 1 cm \\(\\times\\) 1 cm square rod produces combined axial and bending stresses at the gauge section 0.5 m from the tip. The measured strains at the top and bottom surfaces are \\(\\epsilon_1 = 0.0016\\) and \\(\\epsilon_2 = 0.0004\\). For a prismatic bar under combined axial load and bending, normal strain at a distance y from the neutral axis is \\(\\epsilon = \\sigma/E = (P/A)/E \\pm (M y/I)/E\\). Taking the mid-depth as neutral axis, the top and bottom are at \\(y = \\pm h/2 = \\pm 0.5\\,\\text{cm} = \\pm 5\\,\\text{mm}\\). The moment at the gauge section is \\(M = P e\\) because the load is axial but offset by e. Thus \\(\\epsilon_1 = P/(AE) + (P e y/I)/E\\) and \\(\\epsilon_2 = P/(AE) - (P e y/I)/E\\). Adding gives \\(\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 = 2P/(AE)\\), which allows solving for E, and subtracting gives \\(\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2 = 2 P e y/(E I)\\), which allows solving for e without needing E explicitly. Using \\(P = 10\\,\\text{kN} = 10^4\\,\\text{N}\\), \\(A = 1\\,\\text{cm}^2 = 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^2\\), \\(I = b h^3/12 = (0.01)(0.01^3)/12 = 8.33 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}^4\\), \\(y = 0.005\\,\\text{m}\\), \\(\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 = 0.002\\), we get \\(E = 2P/(A(\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2)) = 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}\\). Then from \\(\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2 = 0.0012 = 2 P e y/(E I)\\), solving for e yields \\(e = (0.0012 E I)/(2 P y) \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}\\).
