The question states that the phase angle $C=0$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to $r = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}$.\n    For a two-body problem, the semi-latus rectum $p$ is related to the specific angular momentum $h$ and the gravitational parameter $\\mu = GM$ by the formula $p = \\frac{h^2}{\\mu} = \\frac{h^2}{GM}$.\n    Substituting this expression for $p$ into the trajectory equation, we get $r = \\frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta)}$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   Option A: $r = |h| / (GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta))$ is incorrect because the numerator should be $h^2$.\n    *   Option B: $r = |h|^2 / (GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta))$ is correct, as $|h|^2 = h^2$.\n\n*   **Statement C (h is conserved):** In a two-body system under the influence of a central gravitational force, the specific angular momentum ($h$, angular momentum per unit mass) of the orbiting body is a conserved quantity. This is a direct consequence of the gravitational force being a central force, which means it produces no torque about the center of mass. The RAG context (Chunk 5, 6) explicitly confirms this.\n\n*   **Statement D (The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy of the satellite is conserved):** For a satellite orbiting under a central gravitational force, and in the absence of any non-conservative forces (such as atmospheric drag or thrust), the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) of the satellite is conserved. This is a fundamental principle in conservative force fields. The RAG context (Chunk 2, 5) refers to total energy $H = T - |\\Phi|$ (where $T$ is kinetic energy and $\\Phi$ is potential energy), which is conserved.\n\nTherefore, statements B, C, and D are true."
