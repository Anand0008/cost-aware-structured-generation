Hence:\n- Option A is dimensionally wrong and misses the square on $h$.\n- Option B matches the standard trajectory equation, so it is true.\n\nIn a two-body problem with only central gravitational force:\n- The torque about the center is zero, so angular momentum per unit mass $h$ is conserved. Thus C is true.\n- The gravitational force is conservative and there are no non-conservative forces, so the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant along the orbit. Thus D is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of options is B, C, and D, matching the official key."
