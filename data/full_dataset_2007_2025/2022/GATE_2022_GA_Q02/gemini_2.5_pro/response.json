        "reasoning": "The inequality `2 - 5x \\leq - (6x - 5) / 3` is solved by algebraic manipulation. First, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator: `3(2 - 5x) \\leq -(6x - 5)`. Distributing the terms yields `6 - 15x \\leq -6x + 5`. Next, gather the `x` terms on one side and constants on the other. Adding `15x` to both sides and subtracting `5` from both sides gives `6 - 5 \\leq -6x + 15x`, which simplifies to `1 \\leq 9x`. Finally, dividing by 9 results in `1/9 \\leq x` or `x \\geq 1/9`. This solution indicates all real numbers `x` that are greater than or equal to `1/9`. On a real number line, this is represented by a solid circle (closed dot) at `x = 1/9` (since the inequality is inclusive, 'equal to' is included) and a bold line extending to the right from `1/9` towards positive infinity. Since `1/9` is a positive value, the solid dot should be to the right of 0. Option (C) accurately depicts this, showing a solid circle at a positive value and the line extending to the right."

          "Step 7: Interpret the solution. The inequality `x \\geq \\frac{1}{9}` means all real numbers `x` that are greater than or equal to `1/9`. Since `1/9` is a positive value (approximately 0.111...), the representation on the number line will start at `1/9` (a positive value) and extend to the right.",
