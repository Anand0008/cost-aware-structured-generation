The stagnation entropy (s₀) increases across the shock due to the irreversible nature of the process (Chunk 2).\n3. The stagnation temperature (T₀) remains constant across the shock, as the total enthalpy is conserved (Chunk 1, Chunk 2).\n4. The speed of sound (a) changes across the shock, as the static temperature and Mach number change (Chunk 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B (stagnation entropy changes) and D (speed of sound changes)."
