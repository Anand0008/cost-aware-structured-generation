        "notes": "RAG chunks provided good fundamental knowledge on normal shocks (Chunks 1,2,3,5) and one video note on oblique shock fundamentals (Chunk 4). The context clearly established the constancy of stagnation temperature and increase in entropy. It lacked an explicit statement on the speed of sound change, but provided the formula linking 'a' to 'T' (Chunk 6). Therefore, the RAG context was highly relevant and sufficient for a confident answer, supplemented by internal model knowledge for complete reasoning."
