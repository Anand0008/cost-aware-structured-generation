        "reasoning": "The question asks about the changes across an oblique shock wave in a calorically perfect gas. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. the stagnation enthalpy changes:**\nAccording to the conservation of energy principle for an adiabatic flow across a shock wave (both normal and oblique), the total enthalpy (or stagnation enthalpy, $h_0$) remains constant. For a calorically perfect gas, this implies that the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) also remains constant. (Refer to RAG Chunk 4: \"Conservation of Energy... implies that the stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ (and hence stagnation temperature $T_0$) is constant across an oblique shock: $T_{01} = T_{02}$\"). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B. the stagnation entropy changes:**\nShock waves are inherently irreversible processes due to viscous dissipation and thermal conduction within their thin structure. According to the second law of thermodynamics, any irreversible adiabatic process leads to an increase in entropy. This increase in entropy is directly linked to a loss of stagnation pressure. (Refer to RAG Chunk 2: \"Increase in Entropy: A shock wave is a dissipative process. This means entropy ($s$) must increase, so $s_2 > s_1$\"; and RAG Chunk 4: \"Students sometimes mistakenly assume stagnation pressure is conserved across an oblique shock; it is not, due to the irreversibility of the shock process.\"). Therefore, stagnation entropy changes (increases) across an oblique shock. This option is correct.\n\n**C. the stagnation temperature changes:**\nAs explained for option A, for an adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas, the total enthalpy and thus the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remain constant across a shock wave (both normal and oblique). (Refer to RAG Chunk 4: \"stagnation temperature $T_0$ is constant across an oblique shock: $T_{01} = T_{02}$\"). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**D. the speed of sound changes:**\nThe speed of sound ($a$) for a calorically perfect gas is given by $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, where $T$ is the static temperature. Across a shock wave, the flow is compressed and heated, meaning the static temperature ($T$) increases from upstream to downstream. Since the speed of sound is directly dependent on the static temperature, an increase in static temperature will lead to an increase in the speed of sound. (Refer to RAG Chunk 6: \"the speed of sound in such a gas is solely a function of its static temperature $T$\"; and RAG Chunk 5: \"its velocity drops sharply to subsonic speed. This rapid deceleration compresses and heats the gas almost instantaneously... a large increase in static temperature and static pressure.\"). Therefore, the speed of sound changes across an oblique shock. This option is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, options B and D are correct."

Since static temperature changes, the speed of sound must also change. Thus, option D is correct."
