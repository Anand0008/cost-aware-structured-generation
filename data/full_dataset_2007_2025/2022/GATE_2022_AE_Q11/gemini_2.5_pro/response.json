While option B, `y = 2x - 1`, is algebraically equivalent (derived by simplifying `y - 1 = 2x - 2` to `y = 2x - 1`), option C is the direct result of applying the point-slope formula, which is a standard way to express a line's equation when a point and slope are known."

        "notes": "The RAG context provided highly relevant information regarding the vector and Cartesian forms of tangent line equations for 3D curves. While the question was 2D, the underlying principles of using the derivative for the tangent's direction/slope were directly applicable and reinforced by the RAG. The RAG content helped connect the 2D problem to its more general 3D vector calculus counterpart, which is valuable for deeper learning."
