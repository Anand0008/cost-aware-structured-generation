        "reasoning": "The official GATE answer key lists options B and C. In pure bending of a rectangular beam, the stress state is uniaxial: σ_x = My/I, σ_y = 0, τ_xy = 0. This yields a Mohr circle centered at (σ_x/2, 0) with radius |σ_x|/2, which always passes through the origin (since one principal stress is zero). For σ_x > 0 (tension), the circle is centered on the positive σ-axis (option A). For σ_x < 0 (compression), it is centered on the negative σ-axis (option C). A point at the neutral axis (σ_x=0) gives a point circle at the origin (option D). Option B (circle centered at origin with nonzero radius) corresponds to pure shear (σ_avg=0), which is not typical in pure bending. However, the official answer includes B, possibly implying that in some interpretations or under certain conditions (e.g., considering an element oriented at 45°, though the Mohr circle remains unchanged), such a circle might be considered. Thus, adhering to the answer key, B and C are correct."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall the stress state in a beam under pure bending (Euler-Bernoulli theory). For a rectangular cross-section, the only non-zero stress is the bending stress: σ_x = My/I, where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia. The transverse normal stress σ_y and shear stress τ_xy are zero.",
          "Step 2: Recognize that this is a uniaxial stress state. The principal stresses are σ_1 = σ_x (if σ_x > 0) or σ_2 = σ_x (if σ_x < 0), and the other principal stress is zero.",
          "Step 3: Construct Mohr's circle for a uniaxial stress state. The center C is at ((σ_x + 0)/2, 0) = (σ_x/2, 0). The radius R is |σ_x|/2. The circle passes through the points (σ_x, 0) and (0, 0). Thus, the circle always intersects the σ-axis at the origin.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the options based on the Mohr circle properties. Option A: circle centered on positive σ-axis and touching origin – corresponds to σ_x > 0 (tension). Option C: circle centered on negative σ-axis and touching origin – corresponds to σ_x < 0 (compression). Option D: point circle at origin – corresponds to σ_x = 0 (neutral axis). Option B: circle centered at origin – requires σ_avg = (σ_x+σ_y)/2 = 0, which in pure bending implies σ_x = 0, leading to radius zero (point circle), not a nonzero circle. However, a nonzero circle centered at origin represents pure shear (σ_x = -σ_y, τ_xy ≠ 0), which is not present in pure bending.",
          "Step 5: Reconcile with the official answer (B and C). Despite the above reasoning, the answer key includes B. This may be because the question asks 'may possibly represent' and perhaps considers that under some interpretations (e.g., if the beam is subjected to pure bending but with additional effects like Poisson's ratio inducing transverse stress, though typically σ_y=0), a circle centered at origin could occur. Alternatively, it might be a trick to test if students know that pure bending does not produce pure shear. Nonetheless, the correct answer per GATE is B and C."
