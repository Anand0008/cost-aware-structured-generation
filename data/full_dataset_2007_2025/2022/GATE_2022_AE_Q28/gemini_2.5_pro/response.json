        "reasoning": "1.  **Stress State in Pure Bending:** In a beam of rectangular cross-section subjected to pure bending, the shear force is zero throughout the beam. Consequently, the transverse shear stress ($\\tau_{xy}$) at any point in the cross-section is zero. The normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) varies linearly from the neutral axis, being tensile on one side and compressive on the other, and zero at the neutral axis. The normal stress in the transverse direction ($\\sigma_y$) is also considered zero. Therefore, the stress state at any point in the beam is uniaxial, represented by $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y=0, \\tau_{xy}=0)$.\n\n2.  **Mohr's Circle for Uniaxial Stress:**\n    *   Given stress components: $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = 0$.\n    *   **Center of Mohr's Circle (C):** $C = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x + 0}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x}{2}, 0\\right)$.\n    *   **Radius of Mohr's Circle (R):** $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - 0}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\left|\\frac{\\sigma_x}{2}\\right|$.\n    *   **Principal Stresses:** The principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = C + R$ and $\\sigma_2 = C - R$. For uniaxial stress, one principal stress will always be zero.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Possible Stress States in Pure Bending:**\n    *   **Case A: Point under Uniaxial Tension ($\\sigma_x > 0$)**\n        This occurs in the region of the beam experiencing tensile bending stress (e.g., top fibers for downward bending). The center of the circle is at $(\\sigma_x/2, 0)$ (a positive value on the $\\sigma$ axis), and the radius is $R = \\sigma_x/2$. The principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_2 = 0$. This Mohr's Circle is centered on the positive $\\sigma$ axis and touches the origin. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n    *   **Case B: Point under Uniaxial Compression ($\\sigma_x < 0$)**\n        This occurs in the region of the beam experiencing compressive bending stress (e.g., bottom fibers for downward bending). Let $\\sigma_x = -\\sigma_c$ where $\\sigma_c > 0$. The center of the circle is at $(-\\sigma_c/2, 0)$ (a negative value on the $\\sigma$ axis), and the radius is $R = |-\\sigma_c/2| = \\sigma_c/2$. The principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = 0$ and $\\sigma_2 = -\\sigma_c$. This Mohr's Circle is centered on the negative $\\sigma$ axis and touches the origin. This corresponds to **Option C**.\n    *   **Case C: Point at the Neutral Axis ($\\sigma_x = 0$)**\n        At the neutral axis, the bending stress is zero. The center is at $(0, 0)$, and the radius is $R = 0$. This results in a point circle at the origin. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** A beam under pure bending contains regions of both uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression. Therefore, Mohr's Circles representing these states (Options B and C) are possible. While Option D (a point circle at the origin) also represents a valid stress state (zero stress at the neutral axis), the question typically implies points where *non-zero* bending stress is present, or it is considered a trivial case. Option A is incorrect because it represents a state where both principal stresses are non-zero (or one is zero but the circle doesn't touch the origin), which is not consistent with a uniaxial stress state. Thus, B and C are the correct answers."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the Stress State in Pure Bending.** Recall that for a beam under pure bending, the shear force is zero, which means the transverse shear stress ($\\tau_{xy}$) is zero everywhere in the cross-section. The normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) varies linearly with depth, being tensile on one side, compressive on the other, and zero at the neutral axis. The normal stress in the transverse direction ($\\sigma_y$) is also zero. Thus, the stress state at any point is uniaxial: $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y=0, \\tau_{xy}=0)$.",
          "**Step 2: Apply Mohr's Circle Formulas for Plane Stress.** For a general plane stress state $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy})$, the center of Mohr's Circle is $C = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2}, 0\\right)$ and the radius is $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$.",
          "**Step 3: Substitute Pure Bending Stress Components.** Substitute $\\sigma_y = 0$ and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$ into the formulas:\n    *   Center: $C = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x + 0}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x}{2}, 0\\right)$\n    *   Radius: $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - 0}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\left|\\frac{\\sigma_x}{2}\\right|$",
          "**Step 4: Analyze for Tensile Bending Stress ($\\sigma_x > 0$).** In the tensile region of the beam, $\\sigma_x$ is positive. The center of the circle will be at a positive $\\sigma$ value $(\\sigma_x/2, 0)$, and the radius will be $R = \\sigma_x/2$. This circle starts at the origin (since $\\sigma_2 = C-R = \\sigma_x/2 - \\sigma_x/2 = 0$) and extends to $\\sigma_x$ on the positive $\\sigma$ axis. This matches the description of **Option B**.",
          "**Step 5: Analyze for Compressive Bending Stress ($\\sigma_x < 0$).** In the compressive region of the beam, $\\sigma_x$ is negative. The center of the circle will be at a negative $\\sigma$ value $(\\sigma_x/2, 0)$, and the radius will be $R = |\\sigma_x/2| = -\\sigma_x/2$ (since $\\sigma_x$ is negative, $- \\sigma_x$ is positive). This circle starts at the origin (since $\\sigma_1 = C+R = \\sigma_x/2 + (- \\sigma_x/2) = 0$) and extends to $\\sigma_x$ on the negative $\\sigma$ axis. This matches the description of **Option C**.",
          "**Step 6: Analyze for Zero Bending Stress (Neutral Axis, $\\sigma_x = 0$).** At the neutral axis, $\\sigma_x = 0$. The center of the circle is at $(0, 0)$, and the radius is $R = 0$. This results in a point circle at the origin. This matches the description of **Option D**.",
          "**Step 7: Evaluate the Options.** Since a beam under pure bending contains regions of both tension and compression, Mohr's Circles representing uniaxial tension (Option B) and uniaxial compression (Option C) are both possible. While Option D is also a technically correct representation for the neutral axis, options B and C represent the non-trivial stress states. Option A is incorrect as it does not represent a uniaxial stress state (where one principal stress must be zero, meaning the circle must touch the origin)."
