          "Step 2: State the Gauss Divergence Theorem, which relates the outward flux through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field: $\\iint_S (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS = \\iiint_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) dV$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the divergence of the vector field $\\mathbf{v}$. For $\\mathbf{v} = F_1 \\mathbf{i} + F_2 \\mathbf{j} + F_3 \\mathbf{k}$, the divergence is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial z}$. In this case, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^3) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z^3) = 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2 = 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.",

Also, the differential volume element in spherical coordinates is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\phi \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$.",
          "Step 5: Set up the volume integral with appropriate limits for a unit sphere. The radius $r$ ranges from $0$ to $1$, the polar angle $\\phi$ from $0$ to $\\pi$, and the azimuthal angle $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$.
