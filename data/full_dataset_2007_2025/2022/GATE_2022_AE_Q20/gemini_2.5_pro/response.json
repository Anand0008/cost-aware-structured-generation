        "reasoning": "The normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) in a beam subjected to pure bending is governed by the flexure formula: $\\sigma_x = \\frac{M \\cdot y}{I}$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $y$ is the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis (NA), and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the cross-section about the neutral axis. The magnitude of the normal stress is directly proportional to the distance $y$ from the neutral axis.\n\n1.  **Neutral Axis Location:** The neutral axis always passes through the centroid of the cross-section. For a standard T-shaped cross-section (as shown in the figure, with the flange at the top), it is unsymmetrical about its horizontal axis. Due to the larger area of the flange, the centroid (and thus the neutral axis) lies closer to the flange (top) than to the bottom of the web (stem).\n2.  **Distances to Extreme Fibers:** Consequently, the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme bottom fibers ($y_{bottom}$) will be greater than the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme top fibers ($y_{top}$). This is explicitly mentioned in RAG Chunk 4, which states that for an unsymmetrical T-beam, the neutral axis is not at its geometric mid-height, leading to different maximum bending stresses at the top and bottom extreme fibers.\n3.  **Maximum Stress Magnitude:** Since the magnitude of stress is proportional to $y$, the maximum magnitude of normal stress will occur at the fiber farthest from the neutral axis. Given that $y_{bottom} > y_{top}$ for a T-section, the maximum magnitude of the normal stress is realized at the bottom fibers of the cross-section.\n4.  **Bending Moment Direction:** The figure shows a positive (sagging) bending moment. This causes the top fibers to be in compression and the bottom fibers to be in tension. Therefore, the maximum magnitude of stress will be the maximum tensile stress occurring at the bottom fibers."

          "**Step 2: Identify the Neutral Axis (NA).** The neutral axis always passes through the centroid of the cross-section. This is the axis where bending stress is zero ($y=0$).",
          "**Step 3: Analyze T-Section Geometry.** A standard T-shaped cross-section, as depicted, is unsymmetrical with respect to its horizontal axis. The flange (top horizontal part) typically has a larger area distributed further from the bottom than the web (vertical stem). As a result, the centroid (and thus the neutral axis) of a T-section (with the flange at the top) lies closer to the flange than to the bottom of the web.",
          "**Step 4: Compare Distances to Extreme Fibers.** Because the neutral axis is closer to the top flange, the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme bottom fibers ($y_{bottom}$) is greater than the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme top fibers ($y_{top}$).",
          "**Step 5: Determine Location of Maximum Stress Magnitude.** Since the magnitude of normal stress is directly proportional to the distance $y$ from the neutral axis, the maximum magnitude of stress will occur at the fiber farthest from the neutral axis. As $y_{bottom} > y_{top}$ for a T-section, the maximum magnitude of normal stress is realized at the bottom fibers.",
          "**Step 6: Consider Bending Moment (Optional).** The applied bending moment shown is positive (sagging). This means the top fibers are in compression and the bottom fibers are in tension. The maximum magnitude of stress will be the maximum tensile stress at the bottom fibers."
