Maximum stress magnitude occurs where $|y|$ is maximum. For a T-shaped cross-section symmetrical about the vertical axis, the neutral axis (through the centroid) is not at the mid-height; it is closer to the flange due to its larger area. Thus, the distance to the bottom fibre (end of web) is greater than to the top fibre (top of flange), so $|y|$ is maximum only at the bottom fibres. Hence, maximum stress magnitude is realized only there."
