This means that the dot product of any two of these vectors is either 0 (if they are different vectors) or 1 (if they are the same vector). \n\nTherefore, the dot product of a and (b x c) can only take the values 0 or ±1, depending on the relative orientation of the vectors. This is because the cross product of b and c will result in a vector that is perpendicular to both b and c, and thus perpendicular to a. The dot product of a and this resulting vector will be either 0 (if they are perpendicular) or ±1 (if they are parallel or antiparallel)."
