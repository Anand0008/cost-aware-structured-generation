Since the vectors are orthonormal, the magnitude of this volume is 1. The sign depends on the orientation (right-handed or left-handed system). If $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{c}$ form a right-handed system, the value is +1. If they form a left-handed system (i.e., $\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}$ is opposite to $\\mathbf{a}$), the value is -1. The vectors are linearly independent (not coplanar), so the value cannot be 0. Infinity is not a finite result for unit vectors. Thus, possible values are 1 and -1."

          "Step 2: Recall the geometric meaning of the scalar triple product $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})$. It gives the signed volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors.",
          "Step 3: For mutually perpendicular vectors, the parallelepiped is a rectangular box. The volume is the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the sine of the angles between them. Since they are perpendicular, $\\sin 90^\\circ = 1$. Thus, the magnitude of the volume is $|\\mathbf{a}| \\, |\\mathbf{b}| \\, |\\mathbf{c}| = 1$.",
          "Step 4: The sign of the scalar triple product is determined by the orientation of the triple. If $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{c}$ are in right-handed order (i.e., $\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}$ is in the direction of $\\mathbf{a}$), then $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = +1$. If they are in left-handed order (i.e., $\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}$ is opposite to $\\mathbf{a}$), then $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = -1$.",
          "Step 5: Eliminate other options. Zero would imply the vectors are coplanar (linearly dependent), which contradicts mutual perpendicularity for non-zero vectors. Infinity is not possible as all quantities are finite.",

While these provide foundational background (e.g., orthogonality in Chunk 3, linear dependence in Chunk 2), they do not directly address the scalar triple product or the specific geometric interpretation needed. Therefore, internal knowledge was primarily used to answer. Chunks 2 and 3 were moderately relevant for concepts of coplanarity and orthogonality."
