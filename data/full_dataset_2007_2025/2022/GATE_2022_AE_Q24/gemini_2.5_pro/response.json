        "reasoning": "The expression `a . (b x c)` is known as the scalar triple product. Geometrically, it represents the signed volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors `a`, `b`, and `c`.\\n\\nGiven that `a`, `b`, and `c` are three mutually perpendicular unit vectors:\\n1.  **Unit Vectors**: This means their magnitudes are 1: `|a| = 1`, `|b| = 1`, `|c| = 1`.\\n2.  **Mutually Perpendicular**: This means the angle between any two distinct vectors is `90^\\circ`. So, `a \\perp b`, `b \\perp c`, and `c \\perp a`.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the expression step-by-step:\\n\\n**Step 1: Evaluate the cross product `b x c`**\\nSince `b` and `c` are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, the magnitude of their cross product is:\\n`|b x c| = |b||c|sin(90^\\circ) = (1)(1)(1) = 1`.\\nThe direction of `b x c` is perpendicular to both `b` and `c`.\\n\\n**Step 2: Relate `b x c` to `a`**\\nSince `a` is also a unit vector that is mutually perpendicular to both `b` and `c`, the vector `a` must be parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of `b x c`. Therefore, `b x c` must be either `a` or `-a`.\\n\\n**Step 3: Evaluate the dot product `a . (b x c)` for both possibilities**\\n*   **Case 1: `b x c = a` (Right-Handed System)**\\n    If `a`, `b`, `c` form a right-handed system (like the standard `i, j, k` Cartesian unit vectors where `i . (j x k) = i . i = 1`), then `b x c = a`.\\n    Substituting this into the expression: `a . (b x c) = a . a`.\\n    Since `a` is a unit vector, `a . a = |a|^2 = 1^2 = 1`.\\n\\n*   **Case 2: `b x c = -a` (Left-Handed System)**\\n    If `a`, `b`, `c` form a left-handed system (e.g., if `a=i, b=k, c=j`, then `i . (k x j) = i . (-i) = -1`), then `b x c = -a`.\\n    Substituting this into the expression: `a . (b x c) = a . (-a)`.\\n    `a . (-a) = - (a . a) = -|a|^2 = -1^2 = -1`.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nSince both right-handed and left-handed orientations are possible for three mutually perpendicular unit vectors, the scalar triple product `a . (b x c)` can take the values `1` or `-1`. Therefore, options B and C are correct."

          "name": "Using Determinant for Scalar Triple Product",
          "description": "The scalar triple product `a . (b x c)` can be calculated as the determinant of the 3x3 matrix whose rows (or columns) are the component vectors `a`, `b`, and `c`. For example, if `a = (a_x, a_y, a_z)`, `b = (b_x, b_y, b_z)`, `c = (c_x, c_y, c_z)`, then `a . (b x c) = det([a_x a_y a_z; b_x b_y b_z; c_x c_y c_z])`. To apply this, one could assign specific component values, e.g., for a right-handed system: `a=(1,0,0)`, `b=(0,1,0)`, `c=(0,0,1)`, which gives a determinant of 1. For a left-handed system: `a=(1,0,0)`, `b=(0,0,1)`, `c=(0,1,0)`, which gives a determinant of -1.",
