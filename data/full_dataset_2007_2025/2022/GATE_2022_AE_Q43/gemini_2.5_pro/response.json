        "reasoning": "The function given is $f(x) = \\sin^2(|x|)$. We need to analyze its continuity and differentiability for all $x$.\n\n1.  **Continuity for all x (Option A):**\n    The absolute value function, $g(x) = |x|$, is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The sine function, $h(u) = \\sin(u)$, is continuous for all $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The squaring function, $k(v) = v^2$, is continuous for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The given function $f(x) = k(h(g(x)))$ is a composition of these three continuous functions. A fundamental theorem of calculus states that the composition of continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, $f(x) = \\sin^2(|x|)$ is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Specifically, at $x=0$, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\sin^2(|x|) = \\sin^2(|0|) = \\sin^2(0) = 0$. Also, $f(0) = \\sin^2(|0|) = 0$. Since the limit equals the function value, $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.\n    Thus, Option A is correct, and Option C (not continuous at $x=0$) is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Differentiability for all x (Option B):**\n    To check differentiability, especially at $x=0$ where the absolute value function changes its definition, we can rewrite the function:\n    *   For $x \\ge 0$, $|x| = x$. So, $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$.\n    *   For $x < 0$, $|x| = -x$. So, $f(x) = \\sin^2(-x)$.\n    We know that $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)$ (sine is an odd function). Therefore, $\\sin^2(-x) = (-\\sin(x))^2 = \\sin^2(x)$.\n    This means that $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n    Now, we find the derivative of $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$ using the chain rule:\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin^2(x)) = 2\\sin(x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(x)) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$.\n    Using the trigonometric double angle identity, $2\\sin(x)\\cos(x) = \\sin(2x)$.\n    So, $f'(x) = \\sin(2x)$.\n\n    The function $f'(x) = \\sin(2x)$ is defined and continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since the derivative exists for all $x$, the function $f(x)$ is differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Thus, Option B is correct, and Option D (not differentiable at $x=0$) is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct options are A and B."

While the concept of differentiability at the origin and the behavior of absolute value functions were tangentially related (e.g., Chunk 2 discussing `|x|+|y|` and Chunk 6 mentioning path dependence for non-differentiability), the direct application to a single-variable function like `sin^2(|x|)` was not present. The solution relied mostly on internal knowledge of single-variable calculus."
