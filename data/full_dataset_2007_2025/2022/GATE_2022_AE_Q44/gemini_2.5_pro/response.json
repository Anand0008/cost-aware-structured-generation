        "reasoning": "The question describes a convergent nozzle initially operating with choked flow at its exit (Q). The reservoir pressure ($P_0$) and temperature ($T_0$), as well as the ambient back pressure ($P_b$), remain constant. The exit area of the nozzle is increased.\n\n**Analysis for Option A (the nozzle will remain choked):**\nFor a convergent nozzle, choking occurs when the ratio of the back pressure ($P_b$) to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) is less than or equal to the critical pressure ratio ($P^*/P_0$). The critical pressure ratio is a constant value for a given gas (dependent only on $\\gamma$). Since both $P_0$ (reservoir pressure) and $P_b$ (ambient pressure) are stated to remain constant, the pressure ratio $P_b/P_0$ does not change. As the nozzle was initially choked, this condition ($P_b/P_0 \\le P^*/P_0$) will continue to be satisfied. Therefore, the flow at the nozzle exit (Q) will remain sonic ($M_Q = 1$), and the nozzle will remain choked. Option A is correct.\n\n**Analysis for Option C (the Mach number at section P will increase):**\nSection P is located upstream of the nozzle exit (Q). In a convergent nozzle, the exit is also the throat, where the flow becomes sonic when choked. Let the initial exit area be $A_{exit,1} = A^*_1$. When the exit area is increased, the new exit area becomes $A_{exit,2} = A^*_2$, where $A^*_2 > A^*_1$. The area at section P, $A_P$, is a fixed physical area.\n\nThe Mach number at section P ($M_P$) is related to the area ratio $A_P/A^*$ by the isentropic area-Mach number relation:\n$\\frac{A_P}{A^*} = \\frac{1}{M_P} \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_P^2 \\right) \\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$\n\nSince $A_P$ is constant and $A^*_2 > A^*_1$, the new area ratio $A_P/A^*_2$ is smaller than the initial area ratio $A_P/A^*_1$. For subsonic flow ($M_P < 1$, which is true for section P in a choked convergent nozzle), the area ratio $A/A^*$ is a decreasing function of Mach number $M$. This means that as $A/A^*$ decreases, $M$ increases. Therefore, since $A_P/A^*$ has decreased, the Mach number at section P ($M_P$) must increase. Option C is correct."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the initial state and nozzle type.** The problem describes a convergent nozzle with choked flow at its exit (Q). This means the Mach number at the exit, $M_Q$, is 1. The exit of a convergent nozzle acts as its throat ($A^*$). The flow upstream of the throat (e.g., at section P) is subsonic.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze the choking condition.** Choking in a convergent nozzle depends on the ratio of the back pressure ($P_b$, which is the ambient pressure) to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$). If $P_b/P_0$ is less than or equal to the critical pressure ratio ($P^*/P_0$), the nozzle remains choked. The critical pressure ratio is a constant for a given gas ($\\gamma$).",
          "**Step 3: Evaluate Option A (nozzle remains choked).** The problem states that reservoir parameters ($P_0$) and ambient conditions ($P_b$) remain constant. Therefore, the pressure ratio $P_b/P_0$ remains unchanged. Since the nozzle was initially choked, the condition for choking is still met, and the nozzle will continue to operate in a choked state. So, Option A is correct.",
          "**Step 4: Analyze the change in nozzle geometry.** The exit area of the convergent nozzle is increased. Since the exit of a convergent nozzle is its throat, this means the throat area ($A^*$) has increased.",
          "**Step 5: Apply the Isentropic Area-Mach Number Relation for section P.** Section P is upstream of the throat, so the flow at P is subsonic ($M_P < 1$). The Mach number at P is related to the local area $A_P$ and the sonic throat area $A^*$ by the relation: $\\frac{A_P}{A^*} = \\frac{1}{M_P} \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_P^2 \\right) \\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$.",
          "**Step 6: Evaluate Option C (Mach number at P increases).** The area at section P ($A_P$) is fixed. As the throat area ($A^*$) has increased, the ratio $A_P/A^*$ has decreased. For subsonic flow ($M < 1$), the function $A/A^*$ decreases as $M$ increases. Therefore, a decrease in $A_P/A^*$ implies an increase in the Mach number at section P ($M_P$). So, Option C is correct."
