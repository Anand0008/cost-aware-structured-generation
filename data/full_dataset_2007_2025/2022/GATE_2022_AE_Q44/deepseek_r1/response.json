Increasing exit area (throat area) while keeping reservoir pressure, temperature, and back pressure constant does not change the pressure ratio, so flow remains choked (A). Mach number at an internal section P is determined by area ratio A_P/A*, where A* is throat area. Since A* increases and A_P is fixed, A_P/A* decreases, leading to higher Mach number at P for subsonic flow (C)."
