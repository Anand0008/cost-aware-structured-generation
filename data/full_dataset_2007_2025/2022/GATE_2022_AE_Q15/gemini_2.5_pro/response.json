        "reasoning": "For a two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational flow over a circular cylinder without circulation, the velocity components in polar coordinates are derived from the velocity potential or stream function. On the surface of the cylinder (at radius `r = R`), the radial velocity component `u_r` is zero due to the no-penetration boundary condition. The tangential velocity component `u_\\theta` is given by `u_\\theta = -2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta)`. The speed on the surface is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, `|u_\\theta| = | -2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta) | = 2 U_{\\text{inf}} |\\sin(\\theta)|`. The maximum value of `|\\sin(\\theta)|` is 1, which occurs at `\\theta = \\pi/2` and `\\theta = 3\\pi/2` (the top and bottom points of the cylinder). Therefore, the maximum speed on the cylinder surface is `2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\times 1 = 2 U_{\\text{inf}}`."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem context. The question describes a two-dimensional potential flow over a circular cylinder. This implies incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational flow. It's crucial to assume no circulation unless specified otherwise, which simplifies the velocity field.",
          "Step 2: Recall the velocity field for potential flow over a circular cylinder. In polar coordinates `(r, \\theta)`, the velocity components `u_r` (radial) and `u_\\theta` (tangential) are given by the superposition of a uniform flow and a doublet.",
          "Step 3: Write down the general expressions for velocity components. For a cylinder of radius `R` in a uniform free stream `U_{\\text{inf}}` along the x-axis, the velocity components are: `u_r = U_{\\text{inf}} (1 - R^2/r^2) \\cos(\\theta)` and `u_\\theta = -U_{\\text{inf}} (1 + R^2/r^2) \\sin(\\theta)`.",
          "Step 4: Apply the boundary condition for the cylinder surface. On the surface of the cylinder, `r = R`. Substitute `r = R` into the velocity component equations.",
          "Step 5: Calculate `u_r` and `u_\\theta` on the surface. At `r = R`, `u_r = U_{\\text{inf}} (1 - R^2/R^2) \\cos(\\theta) = U_{\\text{inf}} (1 - 1) \\cos(\\theta) = 0`. This confirms the no-penetration condition. At `r = R`, `u_\\theta = -U_{\\text{inf}} (1 + R^2/R^2) \\sin(\\theta) = -U_{\\text{inf}} (1 + 1) \\sin(\\theta) = -2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta)`.",
          "Step 6: Determine the speed on the surface. Since `u_r = 0` on the surface, the local speed `q` is simply the magnitude of the tangential velocity: `q = |u_\\theta| = |-2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta)| = 2 U_{\\text{inf}} |\\sin(\\theta)|`.",
          "Step 7: Find the maximum speed. The maximum value of `|\\sin(\\theta)|` is 1, which occurs at `\\theta = \\pi/2` (90 degrees, top of the cylinder) and `\\theta = 3\\pi/2` (270 degrees, bottom of the cylinder). Therefore, the maximum speed `q_{\\text{max}} = 2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\times 1 = 2 U_{\\text{inf}}`."
