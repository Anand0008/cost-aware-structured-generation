        "reasoning": "For a subsonic airplane with parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, where $K = 1/(\\pi e AR)$, the quantity $C_D/C_L^{3/2}$ is minimized at a particular $C_L$. This condition is used for minimum power required (or maximum endurance for propeller aircraft). Define $f(C_L) = C_D/C_L^{3/2} = C_{D0} C_L^{-3/2} + K C_L^{1/2}$. Differentiate with respect to $C_L$ and set to zero: $\\frac{df}{dC_L} = -\\tfrac{3}{2} C_{D0} C_L^{-5/2} + \\tfrac{1}{2} K C_L^{-1/2} = 0$. Multiply by $2 C_L^{5/2}$ to clear powers: $-3 C_{D0} + K C_L^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D0}$. Hence at this condition, $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2 = C_{D0} + 3 C_{D0} = 4 C_{D0}$, so $\\dfrac{C_D}{C_L^2} = \\dfrac{4 C_{D0}}{C_L^2} = \\dfrac{4}{3} K = \\dfrac{4}{3} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\pi e AR} = \\dfrac{4}{3 \\pi e AR}$.
