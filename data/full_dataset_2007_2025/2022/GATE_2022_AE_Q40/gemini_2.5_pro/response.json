          "Step 3: Formulate the expression given in the question that needs to be minimized: $f(C_L) = \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$. Substitute the drag polar into this expression: $f(C_L) = \\frac{C_{D,o} + K C_L^2}{C_L^{3/2}}$.",
          "Step 4: Separate the terms to make differentiation easier: $f(C_L) = C_{D,o} C_L^{-3/2} + K C_L^{1/2}$.",
          "Step 5: To find the minimum value of $f(C_L)$, differentiate $f(C_L)$ with respect to $C_L$ and set the derivative equal to zero: $\\frac{df}{dC_L} = -\\frac{3}{2} C_{D,o} C_L^{-5/2} + \\frac{1}{2} K C_L^{-1/2} = 0$.",
          "Step 6: Solve the equation from Step 5 for the relationship between $C_{D,o}$ and $K C_L^2$. Multiply the entire equation by $2 C_L^{5/2}$ to eliminate fractional and negative exponents: $-3 C_{D,o} + K C_L^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $3 C_{D,o} = K C_L^2$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute this condition ($3 C_{D,o} = K C_L^2$) back into the drag polar equation ($C_D = C_{D,o} + K C_L^2$). From the condition, we can write $C_{D,o} = \\frac{K C_L^2}{3}$.",

The RAG context was very helpful in validating the core principles and the derivation steps."
