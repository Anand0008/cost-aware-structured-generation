          "description": "Let K = 1/(π e AR). Then C_D = C_D0 + K C_L^2. Minimize f = (C_D0 + K C_L^2)/C_L^(3/2). Derivative yields 2K C_L * C_L^(-3/2) - (3/2) C_D0 C_L^(-5/2) = 0 => 2K C_L^(1/2) = (3/2) C_D0 C_L^(-5/2) => C_L^2 = (3 C_D0)/(4K)? Wait careful: Actually derivative: d/dC_L [C_D0 C_L^{-3/2} + K C_L^{1/2}] = -(3/2)C_D0 C_L^{-5/2} + (1/2)K C_L^{-1/2}=0 => K C_L^{-1/2} = 3 C_D0 C_L^{-5/2} => K C_L^2 = 3 C_D0 => C_L^2 = 3 C_D0 / K. Since K=1/(π e AR), we get same result.",
