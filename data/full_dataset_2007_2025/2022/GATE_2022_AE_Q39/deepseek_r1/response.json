For geometric similarity and the same $Re$, the drag coefficient ($C_D$) is identical. The drag force formula $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$ is applied, where $S$ is a reference area (for axial flow, frontal area = $\\pi D^2 / 4$). By equating $C_D$ for model and prototype and using the $Re$ equality condition ($\\rho_m V_m D_m / \\mu_m = \\rho_p V_p D_p / \\mu_p$), the unknown model test velocity $V_m$ is eliminated, leading to a direct relationship: $D_p / D_m = (\\rho_p / \\rho_m) (V_p / V_m)^2 (S_p / S_m)$. Substituting the $Re$ condition yields $D_p / D_m = (\\rho_m / \\rho_p) (\\mu_p / \\mu_m)^2$. Plugging in the given values (with proper unit conversion: diameter 900 mm = 0.9 m, half-scale model diameter = 0.45 m) yields $D_p \\approx 644$ N."

          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. For dynamic similarity and identical drag coefficients ($C_D$), the Reynolds numbers must match: $Re_m = Re_p$, where $Re = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu}$.",
          "Step 2: Write the drag force equation. For both model and prototype, $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$, where the reference area $S$ for axial flow is the frontal (circular) area: $S = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$. Since $C_D$ is identical, we have $C_{D,m} = C_{D,p}$.",
          "Step 3: Express the velocity ratio from Reynolds number matching. From $Re_m = Re_p$, we get: $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m D_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p D_p}{\\mu_p}$. Rearranging: $\\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\frac{D_p}{D_m} \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p}$.",
          "Step 4: Form the drag force ratio. Using the drag formula: $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p^2 S_p}{\\rho_m V_m^2 S_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\left(\\frac{V_p}{V_m}\\right)^2 \\frac{S_p}{S_m}$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the area and velocity ratios. Since the model is geometrically half-scaled, $D_m = D_p / 2$. Thus, $S_p / S_m = (D_p / D_m)^2 = 4$. Substitute $V_p/V_m$ from Step 3 into the drag ratio: $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\frac{D_m}{D_p} \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2 \\times 4 = \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2$ (noting that $(D_m/D_p)^2 = 1/4$ cancels the factor of 4).",
          "Step 6: Insert numerical values. Given: $\\rho_p = 1.2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_p = 1.86 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{Pa·s}$, $\\rho_m = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_m = 1.01 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa·s}$, $D_m = 2280 \\, \\text{N}$. Compute $\\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{1.86 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.01 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.0184158$. Then $\\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2 \\approx 3.3914 \\times 10^{-4}$. $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{1000}{1.2} = 833.333$. Therefore, $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = 833.333 \\times 3.3914 \\times 10^{-4} \\approx 0.28262$. Finally, $D_p = 2280 \\times 0.28262 \\approx 644.37 \\, \\text{N}$, rounding to 644 N."
