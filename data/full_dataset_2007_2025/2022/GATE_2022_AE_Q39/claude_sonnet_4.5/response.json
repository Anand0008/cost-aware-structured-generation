        "reasoning": "The question provides the necessary information to apply the principles of dynamic similarity and scaling to calculate the drag force on the full-scale object from the measured drag on the scaled model. By ensuring the Mach number and Reynolds number are the same between the model and full-scale object, the dimensionless drag coefficient will also be the same. Therefore, the drag force on the full-scale object can be calculated by scaling the model drag force by the square of the geometric scaling factor, which is 2 in this case. This results in the correct answer of 644 N."
