        "reasoning": "The problem is solved by applying the principle of dynamic similarity. First, the Reynolds number for the model and prototype must be matched to ensure flow similarity. This allows for the calculation of the required model velocity ($V_m$). Second, for dynamically similar flows, the drag coefficients ($C_D$) are equal for both the model and the prototype. Using this equality, the drag force on the prototype ($D_p$) can be calculated from the measured drag on the model ($D_m$), accounting for the ratios of fluid densities, velocities, and reference areas. The calculated value of 644.49 N rounds to 644 N, which matches option B."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Identify Given Data and Principle.** List all known parameters for the prototype (full-scale object in air) and the model (half-scaled in water). Recognize that 'flow similarity' implies dynamic similarity, which requires matching dimensionless parameters, primarily the Reynolds number for low-speed flows.",
          "**Step 2: Determine Model Dimensions and Area Ratio.** The model is geometrically half-scaled, meaning its diameter ($D_m$) is half of the prototype's diameter ($D_p$). The reference area ($S$) for drag calculation scales with the square of the linear dimension. Therefore, the ratio of prototype area to model area is $S_p / S_m = (D_p / D_m)^2 = (2D_m / D_m)^2 = 4$.",
          "**Step 3: Apply Reynolds Number Matching.** For dynamic similarity, the Reynolds number of the model must equal that of the prototype: $Re_m = Re_p$. Use the formula $Re = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu}$ to set up the equality: $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m D_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p D_p}{\\mu_p}$.",
          "**Step 4: Calculate Model Velocity ($V_m$).** Rearrange the Reynolds number equality to solve for $V_m$: $V_m = V_p \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D_p}{D_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)$. Substitute the given numerical values: $V_m = 60 \\times \\left( \\frac{1.2}{1000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{0.9}{0.45} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1.01 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.86 \\times 10^{-5}} \\right) \\approx 7.819 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "**Step 5: Apply Drag Coefficient Equality.** For dynamically similar flows, the dimensionless drag coefficients are equal: $C_{D,m} = C_{D,p}$. Using the drag coefficient formula $C_D = \\frac{D}{0.5 \\rho V^2 S}$, we can write: $\\frac{D_m}{0.5 \\rho_m V_m^2 S_m} = \\frac{D_p}{0.5 \\rho_p V_p^2 S_p}$.",
          "**Step 6: Calculate Prototype Drag ($D_p$).** Rearrange the drag coefficient equality to solve for $D_p$: $D_p = D_m \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_p}{V_m} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{S_p}{S_m} \\right)$. Substitute the known values, including $D_m = 2280 \\text{ N}$, the calculated $V_m$, and the area ratio $S_p/S_m = 4$: $D_p = 2280 \\times \\left( \\frac{1.2}{1000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{60}{7.819} \\right)^2 \\times 4 \\approx 644.49 \\text{ N}$.

Its drag is estimated on a geometrically half-scaled model in water, assuming flow similarity. Coefficients of dynamic viscosity and densities for air and water are 1.86 x 10^-5 Pa-s, 1.2 kg/m^3 and 1.01 x 10^-3 Pa-s, 1000 kg/m^3 respectively. Drag measured for the model is 2280 N. Drag experienced by the full-scale object is ____ N (rounded off to the nearest integer)."
