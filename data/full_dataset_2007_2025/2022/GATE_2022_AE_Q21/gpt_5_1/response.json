        "reasoning": "The truss has three members: PQ (vertical), QR (horizontal), and PR (diagonal at 45° to QR). Supports: Q is a pin (reactions Qx, Qy), R is a roller on horizontal ground (reaction Ry only). A horizontal force F acts at joint P to the right.\n\n1) Global equilibrium of the whole truss:\n- Sum of vertical forces: Qy + Ry = 0. There is no external vertical load, so Qy + Ry = 0. (1)\n- Sum of moments about Q (taking counter-clockwise positive). Let the vertical distance QP = h and horizontal distance QR = h (since PR is at 45°, triangle is isosceles right):\n  External forces creating moment about Q: F at P (horizontal) and reaction Ry at R (vertical). The line of action of F is horizontal at height h above Q, so its moment arm is h; F tends to rotate the structure clockwise about Q, so its moment is -F h. Ry acts at R, horizontal distance h from Q, giving moment +Ry·h. Thus:\n  Ry·h - F·h = 0 ⇒ Ry = F.\n  Using (1): Qy + F = 0 ⇒ Qy = -F (i.e., downward at Q).\n- Sum of horizontal forces: Qx + F = 0 ⇒ Qx = -F (reaction at Q to the left).\n\n2) Joint R equilibrium to find member force in QR:\nAt joint R, there is only the vertical reaction Ry (upward) and the forces in members QR and PR. Member QR is horizontal, so its force has only horizontal component along QR. Member PR is at 45°, so its force has both horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet the internal axial force in QR be N_QR, assumed tension (pulling away from joint R, i.e., to the left on joint R). Let the force in PR at joint R be N_PR, assumed tension (along member from R towards P, i.e., up-left).\n\nResolve equilibrium at joint R:\n- Horizontal: Components to the right positive. N_QR acts to the left on joint R if tensile, so -N_QR. N_PR has horizontal component N_PR cos45° to the left, so -N_PR/\\sqrt{2}. No external horizontal reaction at R. Thus:\n  -N_QR - N_PR/\\sqrt{2} = 0. (2)\n- Vertical: Upward positive. External Ry = F upward. N_PR has vertical component N_PR sin45° upward (since it is along PR towards P, which is up-left), so +N_PR/\\sqrt{2}. Thus:\n  F + N_PR/\\sqrt{2} = 0 ⇒ N_PR = -\\sqrt{2} F (compression in PR). (3)\n\nSubstitute (3) into (2):\n  -N_QR - ( -\\sqrt{2} F )/\\sqrt{2} = 0 ⇒ -N_QR + F = 0 ⇒ N_QR = F.\n\nSince N_QR is positive in the assumed tensile sense, member QR carries a tensile force of magnitude F. Hence option B, F (tensile), is correct."
