        "notes": "RAG provided relevant chunks on complex number rotation (chunk 1) and coordinate transformation (chunk 6), which directly support the solution methods. Chunk 2 on linear transformations is also somewhat relevant. However, the question is specifically about vector rotation in a GATE AE context, and the RAG did not contain explicit vector rotation matrix formulas from standard AE textbooks (e.g., Shames or Beer & Johnston). The retrieved knowledge was from mathematics and stress analysis contexts, but the principles are transferable. Internal knowledge was used to fill gaps."
