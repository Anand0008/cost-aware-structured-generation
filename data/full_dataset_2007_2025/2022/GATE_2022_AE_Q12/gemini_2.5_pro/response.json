They provided the conceptual foundation for understanding how complex number multiplication can represent rotation and scaling, which is the core principle used in one of the solution methods. Chunk 6 provided coordinate transformation formulas, which were useful for comparison but needed careful distinction from vector rotation. The specific formula for arbitrary angle rotation using complex numbers was directly applied based on the principles outlined in RAG."
