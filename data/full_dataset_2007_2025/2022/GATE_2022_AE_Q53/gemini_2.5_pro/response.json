        "reasoning": "The problem specifies inviscid and isothermal flow. For such a flow, the speed of sound ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$) is constant because the temperature $T$ is constant. The continuity equation for one-dimensional steady flow is $\\rho A V = \\dot{m} = \\text{constant}$. Using the ideal gas law ($p = \\rho R T \\implies \\rho = p/(RT)$) and the definition of Mach number ($V = M a$), the continuity equation can be rewritten as $p_P A_P M_P = p_Q A_Q M_Q$. The momentum equation for inviscid flow is $dp + \\rho V dV = 0$. Substituting $\\rho = p/(RT)$, $V = M a$, and $dV = a dM$ (since $a$ is constant), and using $a^2 = \\gamma R T$, this simplifies to $\\frac{dp}{p} = -\\gamma M dM$. Integrating this from section P to Q yields $\\ln(p_P/p_Q) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} (M_Q^2 - M_P^2)$.\n\nFirst, calculate the speed of sound: $a = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 300} = 347.1885 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThen, calculate the inlet Mach number: $M_P = V_P/a = 15/347.1885 = 0.043199$.\nThe exit Mach number is given as $M_Q = 0.3$ (for minimum area, we take the maximum allowed Mach number).\n\nNow, calculate the pressure ratio: $\\ln(p_P/p_Q) = \\frac{1.4}{2} (0.3^2 - 0.043199^2) = 0.7 (0.09 - 0.001866) = 0.7 \\times 0.088134 = 0.0616938$. So, $p_P/p_Q = e^{0.0616938} = 1.06360$.\n\nFinally, use the continuity equation to find $A_Q$: $A_Q = A_P \\frac{p_P}{p_Q} \\frac{M_P}{M_Q} = 1 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 1.06360 \\times \\frac{0.043199}{0.3} = 1.06360 \\times 0.143997 = 0.153155 \\text{ m}^2$.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, $A_Q = 0.15 \\text{ m}^2$, which falls within the specified range of 0.14 to 0.15."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Calculate the speed of sound ($a$) using the given temperature ($T = 300 \\text{ K}$), characteristic gas constant ($R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg-K)}$), and ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma = 1.4$). Since the flow is isothermal, the speed of sound remains constant throughout the duct. $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 300} = 347.1885 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "Step 2: Determine the Mach number at the inlet (section P), $M_P$, using the given inlet velocity ($V_P = 15 \\text{ m/s}$) and the calculated speed of sound ($a$). $M_P = V_P / a = 15 / 347.1885 = 0.043199$.",
          "Step 3: Identify the Mach number at the exit (section Q), $M_Q$. The problem states that the Mach number must be $\\le 0.3$ to ensure incompressible flow behavior. To find the *minimum* area in a converging duct (where velocity increases), the Mach number at the exit must be the maximum allowed, so $M_Q = 0.3$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the continuity equation for one-dimensional steady flow: $\\rho_P A_P V_P = \\rho_Q A_Q V_Q$. For isothermal flow, $T$ is constant. Using the ideal gas law ($p = \\rho R T$), we have $\\rho = p/(RT)$. Also, $V = M a$. Since $R$, $T$, and $a$ are constant, substituting these into the continuity equation yields $p_P A_P M_P = p_Q A_Q M_Q$. This can be rearranged to $A_Q = A_P \\frac{p_P}{p_Q} \\frac{M_P}{M_Q}$.",
          "Step 5: Derive the pressure-Mach number relation for inviscid, isothermal flow. Start from the momentum equation for inviscid flow: $dp + \\rho V dV = 0$. Substitute $\\rho = p/(RT)$, $V = M a$, and $dV = a dM$ (since $a$ is constant). Also, use $a^2 = \\gamma R T$. This leads to $\\frac{dp}{p} = -\\gamma M dM$.",
          "Step 6: Integrate the derived pressure-Mach relation from section P to Q: $\\int_{P}^{Q} \\frac{dp}{p} = -\\gamma \\int_{P}^{Q} M dM \\implies \\ln(p_Q/p_P) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} (M_Q^2 - M_P^2)$. Rearranging for the pressure ratio $p_P/p_Q$: $\\ln(p_P/p_Q) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} (M_Q^2 - M_P^2)$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the pressure ratio $p_P/p_Q$ using the values from Steps 2 and 3: $\\ln(p_P/p_Q) = \\frac{1.4}{2} (0.3^2 - 0.043199^2) = 0.7 (0.09 - 0.001866) = 0.0616938$. Therefore, $p_P/p_Q = e^{0.0616938} = 1.06360$.",
          "Step 8: Substitute the calculated pressure ratio, $A_P = 1 \\text{ m}^2$, $M_P = 0.043199$, and $M_Q = 0.3$ into the area relation from Step 4: $A_Q = 1 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 1.06360 \\times \\frac{0.043199}{0.3} = 0.153155 \\text{ m}^2$.

Air flow through the nozzle can be assumed to be inviscid and isothermal. Characteristic gas constant is 287 J/(kg-K) and ratio of specific heats is 1.4 for air. To ensure that the air flow remains incompressible (Mach number, M <= 0.3) in the duct, the minimum area required at section Q is _____ m^2 (rounded off to two decimal places).",
