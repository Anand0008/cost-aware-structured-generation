Flow is inviscid and isothermal, so density is constant along the duct (for a given pressure level) and continuity applies: \\(\\rho A V = \\text{constant}\\). To keep the flow incompressible, Mach number must not exceed 0.3 anywhere; the maximum velocity therefore occurs at the minimum area section Q. We first compute the speed of sound at 300 K: \\(a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 300} \\approx 347.2\\ \\text{m/s}\\). The maximum allowable velocity is then \\(V_{\\max} = M_{\\max} a = 0.3 \\times 347.2 \\approx 104.16\\ \\text{m/s}\\). Mass conservation between P and Q (with constant density due to isothermal, low-Mach assumption) gives \\(A_P V_P = A_Q V_Q\\). Taking \\(V_Q = V_{\\max}\\) for the limiting case, \\(A_Q = A_P \\dfrac{V_P}{V_Q} = 1 \\times \\dfrac{15}{104.16} \\approx 0.144\\ \\text{m}^2\\).

They were conceptually related (duct flow, Mach number, area effects) but not directly needed for this low-Mach, incompressible-style calculation. Core solution relied on general compressible-flow knowledge rather than specific RAG formulas."

Air flow through the nozzle can be assumed to be inviscid and isothermal. Characteristic gas constant is 287 J/(kg-K) and ratio of specific heats is 1.4 for air. To ensure that the air flow remains incompressible (Mach number, M <= 0.3) in the duct, the minimum area required at section Q is _____ m^2 (rounded off to two decimal places)."
