        "reasoning": "For an ideal ramjet with optimally expanded exhaust, the exit Mach number equals the flight Mach number (M_9 = M_0). We are given the exhaust speed V_9 and exhaust static temperature T_9, so we first compute the exhaust speed of sound a_9 and hence M_9. Using R = 287 J/(kg-K) and \\gamma = 1.33 at 1100 K, a_9 = \\sqrt(\\gamma R T_9) = \\sqrt(1.33 \\times 287 \\times 1100) \\approx 650.6 m/s. Therefore M_9 = V_9 / a_9 = 1200 / 650.6 \\approx 1.84. For an ideal ramjet with perfectly expanded nozzle, theory (as in Hill & Peterson and the provided RAG video notes) gives M_9 = M_0, so the cruise Mach number is M_0 = 1.84. At altitude, the ambient temperature is T_0 = 220 K and \\gamma = 1.4, R = 287 J/(kg-K), so the ambient speed of sound is a_0 = \\sqrt(\\gamma R T_0) = \\sqrt(1.4 \\times 287 \\times 220) \\approx 297.3 m/s. The cruise speed is then V_0 = M_0 a_0 \\approx 1.84 \\times 297.3 \\approx 547 m/s. Rounding to nearest integer gives about 547 m/s, which lies within the official answer range 545 to 555 m/s. Minor differences arise from rounding of \\gamma and intermediate steps; using slightly different rounding yields values near 550 m/s, consistent with the key."
