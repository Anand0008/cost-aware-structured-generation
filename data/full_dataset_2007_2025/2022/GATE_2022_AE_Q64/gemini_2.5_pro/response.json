        "reasoning": "The problem describes an ideal ramjet with exhaust gases optimally expanded to ambient pressure. Under these specific ideal conditions, a fundamental result in propulsion states that the exhaust Mach number ($M_e$) is equal to the flight Mach number ($M_0$). This is explicitly mentioned in RAG Chunk 3. The solution involves calculating the speed of sound at the nozzle exit using the given exhaust properties ($V_e$, $T_e$, $\\gamma_{exhaust}$, $R_{exhaust}$) to find $M_e$. Then, equating $M_0 = M_e$, the speed of sound at ambient conditions ($a_0$) is calculated using ambient air properties ($T_0$, $\\gamma_{air}$, $R_{air}$). Finally, the cruise speed $V_0$ is determined from $M_0$ and $a_0$. A key assumption made is interpreting the given 'Cp = 287 J/(kg-K) for air' as 'R = 287 J/(kg-K) for air', which is a common convention in GATE exams as 287 J/(kg-K) is the standard gas constant for air, not its specific heat at constant pressure."
