        "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the critical buckling load for a truss. First, the geometry of the truss is analyzed: given BC = 10 cm and base angles of 45 degrees, the triangle ABC is an isosceles right-angled triangle. The length of members AB and AC is calculated as $L = 0.05\\sqrt{2}$ m. Next, a force analysis at joint A (where load P is applied) reveals that members AB and AC are in compression, each carrying a force of $F_{AB} = F_{AC} = P/\\sqrt{2}$. Member BC is in tension and thus will not buckle. Using Euler's buckling formula for pinned-pinned columns ($K=1$), the critical compressive force for members AB and AC is calculated as $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$. Substituting the given values ($E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $I = 0.1 \\text{ cm}^4 = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$), $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(0.05\\sqrt{2} \\text{ m})^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 200}{0.005} \\approx 394784.18 \\text{ N} = 394.78 \\text{ kN}$. For the truss to fail, the force in a member must reach its critical buckling load. Thus, $P/\\sqrt{2} = F_{cr}$, which yields $P = F_{cr} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 394.78 \\text{ kN} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 558.38 \\text{ kN}$. Rounding to the nearest integer gives $558 \\text{ kN}$, which falls within the acceptable range of 550 to 570 kN."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Analyze Truss Geometry and Member Lengths.** From the given image, the truss is an isosceles triangle with base BC = 10 cm and base angles of 45 degrees. This implies that the angle at A is 90 degrees. The horizontal distance from B (or C) to the vertical line through A is $10 \\text{ cm} / 2 = 5 \\text{ cm}$. The length of members AB and AC can be found using trigonometry: $L_{AB} = L_{AC} = \\frac{5 \\text{ cm}}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{5 \\text{ cm}}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm} \\approx 7.071 \\text{ cm} = 0.07071 \\text{ m}$.",
          "**Step 2: Perform Force Analysis using Method of Joints.** Apply equilibrium equations at joint A, where the load P is applied vertically downwards. Let $F_{AB}$ and $F_{AC}$ be the forces in members AB and AC, respectively. Due to symmetry, $F_{AB} = F_{AC}$. Summing forces in the vertical direction: $\\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies F_{AB} \\sin(45^\\circ) + F_{AC} \\sin(45^\\circ) - P = 0$. Substituting $F_{AB} = F_{AC}$, we get $2 F_{AB} \\sin(45^\\circ) = P \\implies 2 F_{AB} (1/\\sqrt{2}) = P \\implies \\sqrt{2} F_{AB} = P$. Therefore, $F_{AB} = F_{AC} = P/\\sqrt{2}$. Since P is a downward load, these forces are compressive.",
          "**Step 3: Identify Compressive Members.** From Step 2, members AB and AC are in compression. Member BC can be found to be in tension ($F_{BC} = P/2$) by analyzing joint B or C. Only members under compression are susceptible to buckling. Since AB and AC are identical in material, cross-section, length, and compressive force, they will buckle simultaneously.",
          "**Step 4: Apply Euler's Critical Buckling Load Formula.** The critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$) for a slender column is given by Euler's formula: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(KL)^2}$. For truss members, the joints are typically considered pinned, so the effective length factor $K=1$. Thus, $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$.",
          "**Step 5: Substitute Given Values and Calculate Critical Member Force.** Convert all units to a consistent system (SI units: N, m, Pa). Given: $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$. $I = 0.1 \\text{ cm}^4 = 0.1 \\times (10^{-2} \\text{ m})^4 = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$. $L = 0.07071 \\text{ m}$. Substitute these into Euler's formula: $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(0.07071 \\text{ m})^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 200}{0.005} \\approx 394784.18 \\text{ N} = 394.78 \\text{ kN}$.",
          "**Step 6: Determine the Applied Load P at Buckling.** The truss fails when the compressive force in members AB or AC reaches their critical buckling force. So, $P/\\sqrt{2} = F_{cr}$. Therefore, $P = F_{cr} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 394.78 \\text{ kN} \\times 1.4142 \\approx 558.38 \\text{ kN}$.",
          "**Step 7: Round Off the Answer.** Rounding $558.38 \\text{ kN}$ to the nearest integer gives $558 \\text{ kN}$."

          "description": "Instead of analyzing joint by joint, a section is cut through the truss, and equilibrium equations (sum of forces and moments) are applied to the isolated section to find forces in specific members. This can be more efficient if forces in only a few specific members are needed.",
