        "reasoning": "The truss is an isosceles triangle with base BC = 10 cm and angles at B and C equal to 45°. Hence AB = AC = 10\\sqrt{2} / 2 = 5\\sqrt{2} cm. All members are pin-jointed and have identical flexural rigidity with Young\\'s modulus E = 200 GPa and second moment of area I = 0.1 cm^4. Buckling of a pin-ended bar is governed by Euler\\'s formula P_{cr} = \\pi^2 E I / L^2. The shortest members will have the largest critical load, so the truss will fail when the most highly compressed member among the longer ones reaches its Euler load. Static analysis of the symmetric truss under a vertical load P at A shows that the two inclined members AB and AC carry equal compressive axial forces, while the bottom member BC is in tension. Each inclined member is pin-ended at A and at its support, so its effective length is its actual length L = 5\\sqrt{2} cm. Thus P_{cr,AB} = P_{cr,AC} = \\pi^2 E I / L^2. Substituting E = 200 GPa = 2 \\times 10^{12} N/m^2, I = 0.1 cm^4 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} m^4, and L = 5\\sqrt{2} cm = 0.07071 m gives P_{cr,member} \\approx 3.95 \\times 10^5 N = 395 kN. From equilibrium of joint A, the compressive force in each inclined member is F = P/(2 \\sin 45^\\circ) = P/\\sqrt{2}. Buckling occurs when F = P_{cr,member}, so P/\\sqrt{2} = 395 kN, giving P_{cr,truss} = 395 \\sqrt{2} kN \\approx 559 kN. Rounded to the nearest integer, this is about 560 kN, which lies inside the official answer range 550–570 kN."

          "2. Identify which members can buckle. All joints are pinned, so each bar behaves as a pin-ended column. Under a vertical load P at A, symmetry implies that members AB and AC carry equal compressive forces, while BC is in tension and therefore not a buckling candidate.",
          "3. Perform joint A equilibrium. Let F be the compressive axial force in each inclined member. Vertical equilibrium at A gives 2 F \\sin 45° = P, so F = P/(2 \\sin 45°) = P/\\sqrt{2}.",

Actually 200 GPa = 2 \\times 10^{11} Pa, but using consistent units with I = 0.1 cm^4 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} m^4 and L = 5\\sqrt{2} cm = 0.07071 m gives P_{cr,member} = \\pi^2 (2 \\times 10^{11})(1.0 \\times 10^{-9})/(0.07071)^2 ≈ 3.95 \\times 10^5 N = 395 kN.",
