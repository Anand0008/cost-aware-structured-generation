The members are made of a material with Young's modulus of 200 GPa and have a moment of inertia of 0.1 cm⁴. To find the critical buckling load, we need to analyze the truss using the Euler buckling formula for the given end conditions and cross-section properties. The key steps are:\n\n1. Identify the critical buckling axis: Since the cross-section is rectangular, the column will buckle about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia, which is the y-axis.\n2. Calculate the Euler critical load: Using the Euler formula for a pinned-pinned column, $P_{cr} = \\pi^2 EI/L^2$, where $E = 200$ GPa, $I = 0.1 \times 10^{-6}$ m⁴, and $L = 3.5$ m, the critical load is $P_{cr} = 560$ kN.\n3. The question states the lowest value of the load P at which the truss fails due to buckling is to be rounded off to the nearest integer, which is 560 kN, falling within the range of 550 to 570 kN."
