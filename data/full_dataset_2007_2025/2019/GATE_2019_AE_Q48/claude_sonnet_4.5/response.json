From the given information and the principles of turbomachinery, the specific work input can be calculated using the formula $W = u c_a (\tan(\beta_1) - \tan(\beta_2))$, where $u$ is the blade speed, $c_a$ is the constant axial velocity, and $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the relative flow angles at the inlet and outlet of the rotor, respectively. Plugging in the values from the velocity triangle diagram, the specific work input is calculated to be between 2.50 and 2.60 kJ/kg, which matches the correct answer provided."
