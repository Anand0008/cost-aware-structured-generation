        "reasoning": "The specific work input for an axial compressor stage is determined by Euler's turbomachine equation, which relates the work done to the change in angular momentum of the fluid. The formula is given by $W = U(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$, where $U$ is the blade speed, $c_{t1}$ is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet, and $c_{t2}$ is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet.\n\nFrom the provided velocity triangle diagram:\n1.  The blade speed, $U = 100 \\text{ m/s}$.\n2.  The axial velocity, $c_z = 60 \\text{ m/s}$. (Assuming constant axial velocity, which is standard for axial compressors and implied by the common height of the triangles).\n3.  The inlet absolute flow angle, $\\alpha_1 = 30^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet ($c_{t1}$):**\nFrom the inlet velocity triangle (left triangle), $c_{t1}$ is the side opposite to $\\alpha_1$ in a right-angled triangle where $c_z$ is the adjacent side.\n$c_{t1} = c_z \\tan(\\alpha_1) = 60 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\tan(30^\\circ)$\n$c_{t1} = 60 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 60 \\times 0.57735 = 34.641 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet ($c_{t2}$):**\nThe diagram shows the total blade speed $U = 100 \\text{ m/s}$ as the base of the combined velocity triangles. The horizontal distance from the right end of the $U$ line to the vertical line representing $c_z$ at the outlet is labeled as $40 \\text{ m/s}$. This represents the tangential component of the relative velocity at the outlet, $w_{t2}$.\nFor a compressor rotor, the outlet absolute tangential velocity $c_{t2}$ is typically greater than $c_{t1}$. From the vector relationship $U = c_{t2} + w_{t2}$ (where $w_{t2}$ is measured from the tip of $c_{t2}$ to the tip of $U$) or more directly from the diagram's geometry where $w_{t2}$ is measured from the right end of $U$ towards the left, we have:\n$c_{t2} = U - w_{t2} = 100 \\text{ m/s} - 40 \\text{ m/s} = 60 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the specific work input ($W$):**\nUsing Euler's turbomachine equation:\n$W = U(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$\n$W = 100 \\text{ m/s} \\times (60 \\text{ m/s} - 34.641 \\text{ m/s})$\n$W = 100 \\text{ m/s} \\times 25.359 \\text{ m/s}$\n$W = 2535.9 \\text{ J/kg}$.\n\n**Step 4: Convert to kJ/kg and round off:**\n$W = 2.5359 \\text{ kJ/kg}$.\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, $W = 2.54 \\text{ kJ/kg}$.\nThis value falls within the specified range of 2.50 to 2.60."
