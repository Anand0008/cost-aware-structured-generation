For a linear mode with solution of the form $x(t)=A e^{\\lambda t}$, the sign of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)$ determines stability. If $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)<0$, the response decays exponentially (stable). If $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)=0$, the amplitude stays constant (neutral). If $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)>0$, the response grows exponentially with time (unstable). RAG chunks 1, 2, 3, and 6 all emphasize that a positive growth rate (e.g., $\\alpha>0$ in $e^{\\alpha t}$) corresponds to instability, while negative growth gives decaying oscillations. Among the options: (A) shows a monotonically increasing, diverging (exponential-like) response; (B) shows exponential decay to zero; (C) shows a response asymptotically approaching a finite constant; (D) shows oscillations with decaying amplitude. Only (A) represents a response that diverges with time, i.e., dynamically unstable."

Combustion instability content (chunk 2) reinforced the role of positive growth rate in instability."
