        "reasoning": "Dynamic stability refers to an aircraft's ability to damp out oscillations and return to its equilibrium flight condition over time, following a disturbance (Chunk 1, Chunk 3). Conversely, dynamic instability means that after a disturbance, the aircraft's response will either grow unboundedly (diverge) or oscillate with increasing amplitude (Chunk 1, Chunk 5). \n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   **Graph A:** Shows a response that grows exponentially over time. This represents an unbounded increase in the perturbation, which is a direct characteristic of dynamic instability. Mathematically, this corresponds to a system with at least one characteristic root having a positive real part ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) > 0$), leading to a response term like $A \\cdot e^{\\lambda t}$ that grows with time (Chunk 1, Chunk 2).\n*   **Graph B:** Shows a response that decays exponentially to zero. This represents an aperiodically stable system (dynamically stable, no oscillation).\n*   **Graph C:** Shows a response that asymptotically approaches a constant value. This also indicates a stable system, settling to a new equilibrium without oscillation (e.g., an overdamped or critically damped response).\n*   **Graph D:** Shows an oscillatory response where the amplitude of oscillations decreases over time. This is characteristic of a dynamically stable, underdamped system (Chunk 3, Chunk 5 Figure 7.8b, Chunk 6).\n\nTherefore, Graph A, depicting exponential growth, is the correct representation of a dynamically unstable airplane's response."
