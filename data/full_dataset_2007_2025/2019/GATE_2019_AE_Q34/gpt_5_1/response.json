For inviscid, incompressible, steady flow with uniform freestream speed U and neglecting gravity, Bernoulli between the freestream and the surface gives the pressure coefficient \\(C_p\\) as \\(C_p = 1 - (V/U)^2\\). On the surface, \\(C_p = 1 - (2\\sin\\theta)^2 = 1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta\\). Setting \\(C_p = 0\\) gives \\(1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta = 0 \\Rightarrow \\sin^2\\theta = 1/4\\). Hence \\(|\\sin\\theta| = 1/2\\).

U is the free stream speed. Ignore the effects of gravity. The azimuthal location (in the first quadrant) on the cylinder at which the pressure coefficient is zero is _______ degrees (round off to the nearest integer)."
