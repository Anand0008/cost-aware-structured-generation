        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the azimuthal location ($\\theta$) on the cylinder surface where the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) is zero. For inviscid, incompressible flow, the pressure coefficient is given by Bernoulli's equation as $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2$, where $V_s$ is the magnitude of the velocity on the surface of the cylinder and $U$ is the free stream speed.\n\n1.  **Identify velocity on the cylinder surface**: The given velocity components are $u_r = U\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right)\\cos\\theta$ and $u_\\theta = -U\\left(1 + \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right)\\sin\\theta$. On the surface of the cylinder, the radial coordinate is $r = R$.\n    *   Substitute $r=R$ into $u_r$: $u_r(r=R) = U\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right)\\cos\\theta = U(1-1)\\cos\\theta = 0$. This confirms that the radial velocity is zero at the surface, as expected for a solid body in inviscid flow.\n    *   Substitute $r=R$ into $u_\\theta$: $u_\\theta(r=R) = -U\\left(1 + \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right)\\sin\\theta = -U(1+1)\\sin\\theta = -2U\\sin\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the magnitude of surface velocity**: The total velocity on the surface, $V_s$, is the magnitude of the tangential velocity component since $u_r=0$ on the surface. So, $V_s = |u_\\theta(r=R)| = |-2U\\sin\\theta| = 2U|\\sin\\theta|$.\n\n3.  **Apply the pressure coefficient condition**: We are given that $C_p = 0$. Using the formula for $C_p$:\n    $0 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2$\n    $\\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2 = 1$\n    $\\frac{V_s}{U} = 1$ (since $V_s$ is a speed, it must be positive)\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\theta$**: Substitute the expression for $V_s$ from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{2U|\\sin\\theta|}{U} = 1$\n    $2|\\sin\\theta| = 1$\n    $|\\sin\\theta| = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n5.  **Find $\\theta$ in the first quadrant**: The question asks for the azimuthal location in the first quadrant, which means $0^\\circ \\le \\theta \\le 90^\\circ$. In this quadrant, $\\sin\\theta$ is positive, so we take $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    $\\theta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$\n    $\\theta = 30^\\circ$\n\nTherefore, the azimuthal location is $30$ degrees."

    "question_text": "The inviscid, incompressible flow field resulting from a uniform flow past a circular cylinder of radius R centered at the origin is given by:\nu_r = U(1 - R^2/r^2)cos(theta)\nu_theta = -U(1 + R^2/r^2)sin(theta)\nwhere u_r and u_theta are the radial and azimuthal velocity components in polar coordinates, (r, theta), as shown in the figure. U is the free stream speed. Ignore the effects of gravity. The azimuthal location (in the first quadrant) on the cylinder at which the pressure coefficient is zero is _______ degrees (round off to the nearest integer)."
