Chunks 3, 4, and 6 discuss related but not directly needed topics (cylinder with circulation, sphere). The RAG context was sufficient to answer the question accurately."

U is the free stream speed. Ignore the effects of gravity. The azimuthal location (in the first quadrant) on the cylinder at which the pressure coefficient is zero is _______ degrees (round off to the nearest integer)."
