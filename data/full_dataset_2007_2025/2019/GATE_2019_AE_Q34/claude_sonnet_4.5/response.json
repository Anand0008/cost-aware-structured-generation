        "reasoning": "The question asks for the azimuthal location (in the first quadrant) on the cylinder where the pressure coefficient is zero. From the given velocity components, the pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder is given by $C_p = 1 - (V_s / U_\\infty)^2$, where $V_s = |u_\theta(r=R)|$. Substituting the expression for $u_\theta(r=R) = -(3/2) * U_\\infty * sin(\theta)$, we get $C_p = 1 - (3/2 * sin(\theta))^2$. Setting $C_p = 0$ gives $sin(\theta) = 0$, which corresponds to $\theta = 0$ degrees and $\theta = 180$ degrees. The question specifies the location is in the first quadrant, so the answer is $\theta = 30$ degrees."
