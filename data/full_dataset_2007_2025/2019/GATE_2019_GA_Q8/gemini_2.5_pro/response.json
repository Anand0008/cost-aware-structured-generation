This explicitly means that 'gayaki' refers to vocal styles and 'baaj' refers to instrumental styles. \n\nLet's evaluate the options based on the text:\n- A. dhrupad, baani: The text says 'dhrupad styles were identified as baanis.' This pairing is correct.\n- B. gayaki, vocal: The text says 'gayaki and baaj were used to refer to vocal and instrumental styles, respectively.' This means gayaki refers to vocal styles. This pairing is correct.\n- C. baaj, institution: The text says 'baaj' refers to instrumental styles, not institutions. Therefore, this pairing is NOT correct.\n- D. gharana, lineage: The text says 'Gharana originally referred to hereditary musicians from a particular lineage'. This pairing is correct.\n\nSince the question asks for the pairing that is NOT correct, option C is the answer."
