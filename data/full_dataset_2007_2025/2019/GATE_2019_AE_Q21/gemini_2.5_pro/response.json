Therefore, we can find the specific heat at constant pressure ($C_p$) using the formula $\\Delta H = m C_p \\Delta T$. Once $C_p$ is determined, we can use the relationship between $C_p$, $C_v$, and the specific gas constant $R$ for a diatomic gas. For a calorically perfect diatomic gas, $C_p = (7/2)R$ and $C_v = (5/2)R$, which implies $C_p/C_v = 7/5 = 1.4$ and $C_p - C_v = R$. The calculated value of $C_v = 0.714...$ kJ/kgK, rounded to two decimal places, is 0.71 kJ/kgK, which falls within the acceptable range of 0.70 to 0.72."

Chunk 5 also provided useful context on specific heat variation. The RAG context was excellent and directly supported the solution."
