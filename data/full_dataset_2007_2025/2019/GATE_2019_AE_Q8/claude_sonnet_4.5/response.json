        "reasoning": "The statement 'the ground-roll distance increases' is false when a propeller airplane experiences a headwind during takeoff. According to the principles of aircraft takeoff performance, a headwind reduces the ground speed of the aircraft, which in turn reduces the ground roll distance required for takeoff. This is because the aircraft can achieve the required liftoff speed in a shorter distance due to the headwind. The other statements (A, B, C) are all true - the drag increases, the thrust from the propellers decreases, and the wing lift increases in the presence of a headwind during takeoff."
