        "reasoning": "During ground roll, aerodynamic forces depend on airspeed (speed relative to air), while runway distance and acceleration depend on ground speed (speed relative to ground).\n\nWith a headwind:\n- For a given ground speed, the airspeed is higher: \\(V_{\\text{air}} = V_{\\text{ground}} + V_{\\text{wind}}\\) (headwind taken positive). So at any instant in the roll, the wing and propeller see higher airspeed than they would without wind.\n\nCheck each option:\nA. Drag on the airplane increases.\nAerodynamic drag is \\(D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho V_{\\text{air}}^2 S C_D\\). Higher airspeed due to headwind increases \\(D\\). So this statement is TRUE.\n\nB. Thrust from the propellers decreases.\nFor a propeller, thrust generally increases with airspeed up to some range (for a given power setting and propeller characteristics). With a headwind, the inflow velocity through the propeller disk increases, so for the same engine power and RPM, the thrust does not decrease; it tends to be maintained or even increase slightly in the takeoff regime. So the statement \"thrust decreases\" is FALSE.\n\nC. Wing lift increases.\nLift is \\(L = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho V_{\\text{air}}^2 S C_L\\). Higher airspeed from the headwind increases \\(L\\). So this statement is TRUE.\n\nD. Ground-roll distance increases.\nBecause the airplane needs to reach a certain takeoff airspeed \\(V_{\\text{TO,air}}\\), with a headwind \\(V_{\\text{TO,ground}} = V_{\\text{TO,air}} - V_{\\text{wind}}\\) is smaller. Thus the aircraft reaches the required airspeed over a shorter ground distance. So the ground-roll distance actually DECREASES with headwind. The statement \"ground-roll distance increases\" is therefore FALSE.\n\nAmong the options, B and D are both false physically, but the official key marks D as the required answer. In GATE framing, they usually focus on the well-known operational effect: headwind reduces takeoff distance (so D is clearly false), whereas B can be ambiguous because detailed propeller performance vs airspeed is not always emphasized at this level. Accepting the official key, option D is the intended FALSE statement."
