        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge consistently indicates that for a single stage, a centrifugal compressor achieves a significantly higher pressure ratio (typically 4-10:1) compared to an axial compressor (typically 1.15-1.25:1). This is due to the larger change in kinetic energy and subsequent diffusion possible in a radial flow path. Therefore, the CPR of an axial compressor is less than the CPR of a centrifugal compressor for a single stage, making option B correct."

          "Step 1: Identify the core components and metric. The question asks to compare the 'highest possible compressor pressure ratio (CPR)' for a 'single stage subsonic compressor' between axial and centrifugal types.",
          "Step 2: Recall the characteristics of a single-stage axial compressor. Axial compressors achieve a relatively modest pressure rise per stage, typically around 1.15 to 1.25. This is due to aerodynamic limitations such as avoiding flow separation and ensuring stable operation.",
          "Step 3: Recall the characteristics of a single-stage centrifugal compressor. Centrifugal compressors are capable of achieving a much higher pressure ratio in a single stage, typically ranging from 4:1 to 5:1, and even up to 10:1 in advanced supersonic designs. This high pressure rise is attributed to the significant centrifugal effects and large diffusion achieved in the radial flow path.",
          "Step 4: Compare the single-stage pressure ratios. By comparing the typical values (Axial: $\\approx 1.25$ vs. Centrifugal: $\\approx 5-10$), it is evident that a single-stage centrifugal compressor provides a substantially higher pressure ratio than a single-stage axial compressor.",
          "Step 5: Formulate the correct statement. Based on the comparison, the pressure ratio of an axial compressor per stage is less than that of a centrifugal compressor per stage.",
          "Step 6: Select the corresponding option. Option B, 'CPR of an axial compressor < CPR of centrifugal compressor', accurately reflects this comparison."
