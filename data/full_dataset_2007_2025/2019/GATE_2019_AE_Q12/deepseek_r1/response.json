          "Step 2: Recall fundamental design principles. The pressure ratio per stage is limited by aerodynamic considerations like diffusion, flow separation, and blade speed.",
          "Step 3: Compare axial compressor characteristics. In an axial compressor, air flows parallel to the axis. Achieving high diffusion in a single stage is difficult due to adverse pressure gradients and the risk of stall. Therefore, the pressure rise per stage is low (typically $r_{p,axial} \\approx 1.15-1.25$).",
          "Step 4: Compare centrifugal compressor characteristics. In a centrifugal compressor, air is flung radially outward by centrifugal force, which provides a very effective means of pressure rise. This allows a much higher pressure rise in a single stage (typically $r_{p,centrifugal} \\approx 4-8$).",
          "Step 5: Synthesize the comparison. Since $r_{p,centrifugal} > r_{p,axial}$ for a single stage, the highest possible CPR for a centrifugal compressor is greater than that for an axial compressor.",
          "Step 6: Eliminate other options. Option A is the opposite of the truth. Option C is incorrect because the values are not equal. Option D is incorrect because the pressure ratio per stage is physically constrained by the working principles of each compressor type; they cannot achieve 'any value.'"
