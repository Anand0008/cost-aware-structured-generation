Using the von Mises yield criterion, the maximum load along the z-direction that can be applied at C such that AB does not yield can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the principal stresses in bar AB:\n   - Since AB and BC are identical, the stresses in AB will be the critical ones.\n   - For a circular cross-section under axial loading, the only non-zero stress component is the axial stress: `sigma_x = P/A`, where P is the applied load and A is the cross-sectional area.\n   - The von Mises yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the von Mises equivalent stress `sigma_e` equals the yield stress `sigma_y`.\n   - For the plane stress condition in AB, the von Mises equivalent stress simplifies to: `sigma_e = sqrt(sigma_x^2 - sigma_x*sigma_y + sigma_y^2)`\n   - Substituting `sigma_y = 0` (since there is no transverse stress), we get: `sigma_e = |sigma_x|\n\n2. Solve for the maximum load P:\n   - At yielding, `sigma_e = sigma_y = 280 MPa`\n   - Substituting the cross-sectional area `A = pi*r^2 = pi*(10 mm)^2/4 = 78.54 mm^2`:\n   - `280 MPa = P / 78.54 mm^2`\n   - Solving for P, we get: `P = 280 MPa * 78.54 mm^2 = 22,031 N`\n\n3. Round the answer to the nearest integer:\n   - 22,031 N rounds to 22,000 N.\n\nTherefore, the maximum load along the z-direction that can be applied at C such that AB does not yield is 22,000 N."
