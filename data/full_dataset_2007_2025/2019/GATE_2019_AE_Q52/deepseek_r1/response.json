          "Step 2: Determine internal forces and moments in bar AB. The load P at C causes: (a) a force P in the z-direction at B, and (b) a torque T = P * L_BC about the axis of AB (y-axis) due to the moment arm L_BC. At the fixed end A of bar AB, the bending moment due to force P is M_b = P * L_AB (about x-axis), and the torque is T = P * L_BC (constant along AB).",

          "Step 6: Solve for P. Substitute expressions, set up equation: √( (4 P L_AB/(π r^3))^2 + 3*(2 P L_BC/(π r^3))^2 ) = σ_yield. Simplify to: P = σ_yield / √( (4 L_AB/(π r^3))^2 + 3*(2 L_BC/(π r^3))^2 ). Plug numbers: r=0.01 m, σ_yield=280e6 Pa, L_AB=0.55 m, L_BC=0.5 m. Compute π r^3 = 3.1416e-6. Then P ≈ 314.2 N.

Therefore, internal knowledge was used to set up the stress state and solve the problem."
