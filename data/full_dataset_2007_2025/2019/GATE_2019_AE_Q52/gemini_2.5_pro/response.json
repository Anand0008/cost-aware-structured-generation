          "Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of the torque `T` and bending moment `M` on bar AB. The torque `T` about the x-axis in AB is `P \\cdot L_{BC}`. The bending moment `M` about the y-axis in AB is `P \\cdot L_{AB}`.",

For a circular cross-section, the maximum bending stress is `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{M r}{I}$` and the maximum torsional shear stress is `$\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{T r}{J}$`.

The critical point is on the outer surface (e.g., top or bottom fiber) where both bending normal stress and torsional shear stress are maximum.

Using the von Mises yield criterion, the maximum load along the z-direction (perpendicular to the plane of paper) that can be applied at C, such that AB does not yield is _____ N (round off to the nearest integer)."
