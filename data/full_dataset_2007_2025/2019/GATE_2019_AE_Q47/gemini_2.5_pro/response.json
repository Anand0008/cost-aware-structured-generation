The formula for turbine isentropic efficiency (total-to-total) is given by: $\\eta_T = \\frac{T_{03} - T_{04}}{T_{03} - T_{04'}}$.\\nFirst, we need to calculate the ideal (isentropic) exit stagnation temperature, $T_{04'}$. For an isentropic expansion of a calorically perfect gas, the relation between stagnation temperature and pressure is: $T_{04'} = T_{03} \\left(\\frac{P_{04}}{P_{03}}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$.\\nGiven:\\n- Ratio of specific heats, $\\gamma = 1.2$\n- Pressure ratio across the turbine stage, $P_{04}/P_{03} = 0.14$ (This is the expansion ratio, as a pressure ratio greater than 1 would imply compression, which is incorrect for a turbine. If it were $P_{03}/P_{04} = 0.14$, the efficiency would be $>100\\%$, which is impossible.)\n- Turbine inlet stagnation temperature, $T_{03} = 1200$ K\n- Turbine exit stagnation temperature (actual), $T_{04} = 900$ K\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate the exponent $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma$:\n$(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = 0.2/1.2 = 1/6 \\approx 0.16667$\n\\nStep 2: Calculate the ideal (isentropic) exit stagnation temperature, $T_{04'}$:\n$T_{04'} = 1200 \\times (0.14)^{1/6}$\n$T_{04'} = 1200 \\times 0.72051$\n$T_{04'} = 864.612$ K\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the total-to-total turbine efficiency, $\\eta_T$:\n$\\eta_T = \\frac{1200 - 900}{1200 - 864.612}$\n$\\eta_T = \\frac{300}{335.388}$\n$\\eta_T \\approx 0.89447$\\n\\nStep 4: Convert to percentage and round off to the nearest integer:\n$\\eta_T = 89.447\\% \\approx 89\\%$.
