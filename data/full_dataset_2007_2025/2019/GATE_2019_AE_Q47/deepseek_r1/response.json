However, the chunks had medium relevance scores (0.48-0.49) as they covered broader topics (ideal cycles, combustor pressure loss). The core formulas needed were present, but the specific problem context (γ=1.2, pressure ratio 0.14) was not covered. Internal knowledge was used for the numerical solution."
