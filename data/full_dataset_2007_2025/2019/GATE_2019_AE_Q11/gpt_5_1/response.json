        "reasoning": "Thrust specific fuel consumption (tsfc) is the fuel mass flow rate per unit thrust; lower tsfc means better fuel economy. For the same thrust at a given flight condition (here Mach 2 at 11 km), typical trends are:\n1) Turbofan: Accelerates a large mass of air by a small velocity increment (especially the bypass stream). This gives high propulsive efficiency and low tsfc. Modern high-bypass turbofans have the lowest tsfc among air‑breathing engines in the transonic/supersonic cruise range.\n2) Turbojet: Accelerates a smaller mass of air to a much higher jet velocity. This reduces propulsive efficiency and increases tsfc relative to a turbofan.\n3) Ramjet: Has no compressor; heat is added at relatively low pressure, giving poor cycle (thermal) efficiency and hence high specific fuel consumption. RAG chunk 6 explicitly states ramjets have SFC comparable to turbojets with afterburner and much higher than basic turbojets. Therefore, at Mach 2 for equal thrust, the ordering from lowest to highest tsfc is: Turbofan (best), Turbojet (higher), Ramjet (highest), which corresponds to option B."
