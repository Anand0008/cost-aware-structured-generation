        "reasoning": "The question asks for the correct order from the lowest Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) to the highest TSFC for Turbofan, Ramjet, and Turbojet engines while flying at Mach 2.0, 11 km altitude, and producing the same thrust. \\n\\n1.  **Turbofan Engines:** Turbofans are designed for high propulsive efficiency, especially at subsonic and transonic speeds, by accelerating a large mass of air to a relatively lower exhaust velocity. This results in the lowest TSFC among the three engine types for most operational conditions, including Mach 2.0, although their efficiency starts to drop at very high Mach numbers. RAG Chunk 4 explicitly states that turbofans have a 'lower thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) compared to turbojets'.\\n\\n2.  **Turbojet Engines:** Turbojets accelerate a smaller mass of air to a very high exhaust velocity. While effective for high-speed flight, their propulsive efficiency is generally lower than turbofans, leading to a higher TSFC. RAG Chunk 6 provides typical SFC values, indicating turbojets have higher SFC than turbofans (implied by turbofan's superior efficiency) but lower than ramjets.\\n\\n3.  **Ramjet Engines:** Ramjets are most efficient at very high Mach numbers (typically M > 2.5-3.0) because they rely solely on the ram effect for compression, eliminating heavy rotating machinery. However, at Mach 2.0, while operational, their thermal efficiency is generally lower than a turbojet because heat addition occurs at a relatively lower static pressure in the combustor compared to the peak pressure achieved in a turbojet's compressor. This fundamental thermodynamic limitation, as highlighted in RAG Chunk 6, leads to a significantly higher TSFC for ramjets compared to non-afterburning turbojets, often comparable to afterburning turbojets. RAG Chunk 6 explicitly states: 'Ramjet: $60 - 90 \\text{ mg/(N*s)}$' and 'Turbojet (main engine): $16 - 24 \\text{ mg/(N*s)}$', clearly showing ramjets have a much higher SFC.\\n\\nTherefore, the order from lowest TSFC to highest TSFC is Turbofan, Turbojet, Ramjet."

          "Step 2: Recall the general performance characteristics of Turbofan engines. Turbofans achieve high propulsive efficiency by accelerating a large mass of air to a moderate exhaust velocity. This design typically results in the lowest TSFC among jet engines, especially at the given flight conditions (Mach 2.0, 11 km altitude), making them ideal for commercial transport (RAG Chunk 4).",

This leads to a significantly higher TSFC for ramjets compared to turbojets (RAG Chunk 6).",
