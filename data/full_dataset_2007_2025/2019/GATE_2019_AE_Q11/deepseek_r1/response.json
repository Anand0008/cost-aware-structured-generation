At Mach 2.0, turbofans (especially high bypass) may not be optimal, but low bypass turbofans still offer better fuel efficiency than turbojets, and ramjets are least efficient at this Mach number due to lower thermal efficiency from heat addition at relatively lower pressures."

Turbojets have medium TSFC. Ramjets have high TSFC because they rely on ram compression which, at Mach 2.0, gives moderate pressure ratio, and heat addition occurs at lower pressure than in turbojets, reducing thermal efficiency.",

At this supersonic speed, turbofans (low bypass ratio) can operate efficiently; turbojets are designed for such speeds; ramjets operate but are not at their peak efficiency (which is at higher Mach numbers). The condition 'producing the same thrust' ensures we compare TSFC directly.",
