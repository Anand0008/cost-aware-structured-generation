        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C, 'to whom'. The blank requires a relative pronoun that acts as the object of the preposition 'to'. The relative clause '_______ the flood victims owed their lives' means the flood victims owed their lives TO someone. The antecedent for the relative pronoun is 'The fishermen' (people). 'Whom' is the objective case of 'who' and is used for people. The preposition 'to' must be placed before the relative pronoun 'whom' because it is part of the phrasal structure 'owed to'. 'To which' (B) is for things, not people. 'Whom' alone (A) is incorrect because the preposition 'to' is missing. 'That' (D) cannot be used directly after a preposition in standard English (we don't say 'to that the victims owed...')."

          "Step 2: Determine the grammatical function of the blank in the embedded clause. The verb is 'owed'. The structure is 'owed [something] to [someone]' or 'owed [someone] [something]'. Here, 'their lives' is the direct object. Therefore, the fishermen are the indirect object/recipient, connected by the preposition 'to'.",
          "Step 3: Select the appropriate relative pronoun. The antecedent ('The fishermen') is human and is the object of the preposition 'to'. Therefore, we need the objective relative pronoun for people: 'whom'.",
          "Step 4: Place the preposition correctly. In formal English, when the relative pronoun is the object of a preposition, the preposition is often placed before the pronoun (preposition + whom/which). Thus, 'to whom' is the correct construction.",
          "Step 5: Eliminate incorrect options. A ('whom') lacks the necessary preposition 'to'. B ('to which') is for things/animals, not people. D ('that') cannot follow a preposition directly in this context."
