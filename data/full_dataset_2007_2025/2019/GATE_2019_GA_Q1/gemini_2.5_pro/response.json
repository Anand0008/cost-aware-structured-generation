        "reasoning": "The sentence requires a relative pronoun that refers to 'the fishermen' and acts as the object of the preposition 'to'. The phrase implies 'the flood victims owed their lives *to the fishermen*'. In English grammar, 'whom' is the objective case for people and is used after prepositions. 'To whom' correctly forms the prepositional phrase that modifies 'owed'.\n\n- Option A ('whom'): While 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun for people, it is missing the necessary preposition 'to'. The verb 'owed' in this context implies 'owed *to* someone'.\n- Option B ('to which'): 'Which' is used for things or animals, not people. 'The fishermen' are people.\n- Option C ('to whom'): This is correct. 'To' is the necessary preposition, and 'whom' is the objective relative pronoun for people, correctly referring to 'the fishermen' as the indirect object of the verb 'owed'.\n- Option D ('that'): 'That' can be used as a relative pronoun for people or things, but it generally does not follow a preposition in this specific construction (e.g., you wouldn't say 'to that'). While 'that' can sometimes replace 'whom' in informal speech, it's not grammatically correct after a preposition in formal writing or for an indirect object in this manner."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Analyze the sentence structure and identify the role of the missing word. The sentence states 'The fishermen, _______ the flood victims owed their lives, were rewarded by the government.' The clause 'the flood victims owed their lives' needs to relate back to 'the fishermen'.",
          "Step 2: Determine the relationship between 'owed' and 'the fishermen'. The victims 'owed their lives' *to* the fishermen. This indicates that 'the fishermen' are the indirect object of the verb 'owed', and a preposition 'to' is implied.",
          "Step 3: Recall the rules for relative pronouns. 'Who' is used for subjects (e.g., 'who saved them'), and 'whom' is used for objects (e.g., 'whom they saved') or after prepositions (e.g., 'to whom'). 'Which' is used for things or animals, not people.",
          "Step 4: Apply the 'he/him' test for 'who/whom'. If you can replace the pronoun with 'he', use 'who'. If you can replace it with 'him', use 'whom'. In the implied clause 'the flood victims owed their lives to him', 'him' fits, indicating that 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun.",
          "Step 5: Combine the necessary preposition and the correct relative pronoun. Since the preposition 'to' is required to express the indirect object relationship, and 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun for people, the combination 'to whom' is the grammatically correct choice.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the given options. Option C, 'to whom', aligns with the grammatical rules identified in the previous steps. Options A, B, and D are incorrect for the reasons stated in the answer validation."
