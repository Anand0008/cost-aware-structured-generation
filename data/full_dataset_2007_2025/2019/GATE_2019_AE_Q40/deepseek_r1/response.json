At point P, 2 m ahead, additional vertical acceleration due to pitch acceleration is \\( \\alpha \\times r \\) in the vertical direction, yielding \\( a_{z,P} = g + \\alpha x_P \\).

The vertical load factor measured at this instant at the centre of gravity (CG) is 2. Given that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s², the vertical load factor measured at point P on the nose of the airplane, which is 2 m ahead of the CG, is _____ (round off to 2 decimal places)."
