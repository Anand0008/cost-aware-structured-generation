However, the RAG context did not explicitly cover the rigid body dynamics aspect of calculating acceleration at a point due to angular *acceleration*, which was crucial for solving this specific problem. I relied on internal knowledge for the $a_{tangential} = r \\ddot{\\theta}$ part."

The vertical load factor measured at this instant at the centre of gravity (CG) is 2. Given that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s², the vertical load factor measured at point P on the nose of the airplane, which is 2 m ahead of the CG, is _____ (round off to 2 decimal places)."
