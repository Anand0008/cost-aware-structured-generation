Options 1 and 3 (\"Some who were involved in the strike were students\" / \"At least one student was involved in the strike\") are not necessarily true. The original statement only guarantees that *some* students were *not* involved; it provides no information about whether *any* students *were* involved. It's possible that all students were not involved.
