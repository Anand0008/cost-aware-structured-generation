        "reasoning": "All three cables have identical length and cross-sectional area, but different Young\\'s moduli: the central steel cable has modulus 3E, while the two outer aluminium cables have modulus E. Because the slab is rigid and horizontal, all three attachment points undergo the same vertical displacement. Thus the three cables are in parallel under a common deformation (iso-strain condition). For a bar in axial loading, stiffness is $k = \\dfrac{EA}{L}$. With same $A$ and $L$, stiffness is proportional to $E$. Hence: $k_1 = E$, $k_2 = 3E$, $k_3 = E$. The total stiffness is $k_{\\text{tot}} = E + 3E + E = 5E$. Load in each cable is proportional to its stiffness: $P_i = k_i \\dfrac{\\delta}{L}$, so $P_2 / W = k_2 / k_{\\text{tot}} = 3E / 5E = 3/5 = 0.6$. Therefore the central cable carries 60% of the total weight W. This matches the official answer range 60 to 60."
