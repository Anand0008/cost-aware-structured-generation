Since the central steel cable has a higher Young's modulus (3E) compared to the aluminum cables (E), it will carry a larger portion of the total load. Using the principle of strain compatibility and force equilibrium, we can derive the expression for the percentage of the total weight carried by the central steel cable as 60%."
