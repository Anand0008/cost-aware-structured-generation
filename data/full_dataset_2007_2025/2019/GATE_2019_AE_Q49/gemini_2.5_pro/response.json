        "reasoning": "The problem involves a rigid slab supported by three cables of identical length and cross-sectional area, but different Young's moduli. This is a classic case of parallel connection where all cables experience the same axial deformation (and thus the same strain). The load carried by each cable is proportional to its axial stiffness ($EA$).\n\nLet $L$ be the length and $A$ be the cross-sectional area of each cable.\nLet $E_s = 3E$ be the Young's modulus of the central steel cable.\nLet $E_a = E$ be the Young's modulus of the two outer aluminum cables.\n\n1.  **Strain Compatibility:** Since the slab is rigid and remains horizontal, and all cables have the same initial length, their elongations ($\\Delta L$) must be equal. Therefore, the axial strain ($\\epsilon = \\Delta L / L$) in all cables must be the same.\n    $\\epsilon_s = \\epsilon_a = \\epsilon$\n\n2.  **Stress-Strain Relationship (Hooke's Law):**\n    $\\sigma_s = E_s \\epsilon = 3E \\epsilon$\n    $\\sigma_a = E_a \\epsilon = E \\epsilon$\n\n3.  **Axial Forces in Cables:**\n    $P_s = \\sigma_s A = (3E \\epsilon) A = 3EA \\epsilon$ (Force in central steel cable)\n    $P_a = \\sigma_a A = (E \\epsilon) A = EA \\epsilon$ (Force in each aluminum cable)\n\n4.  **Force Equilibrium:** The total weight $W$ is supported by one steel cable and two aluminum cables.\n    $W = P_s + 2 P_a$\n    $W = (3EA \\epsilon) + 2 (EA \\epsilon)$\n    $W = 3EA \\epsilon + 2EA \\epsilon$\n    $W = 5EA \\epsilon$\n\n5.  **Calculate the force in the central cable ($P_s$):**\n    From step 3, $P_s = 3EA \\epsilon$.\n    From step 4, we can express $EA \\epsilon$ as $W/5$.\n    Substitute this into the expression for $P_s$:\n    $P_s = 3 (W/5) = \\frac{3}{5} W$\n\n6.  **Calculate the percentage of total weight taken by the central cable:**\n    Percentage $= \\frac{P_s}{W} \\times 100\\%$\n    Percentage $= \\frac{\\frac{3}{5} W}{W} \\times 100\\%$\n    Percentage $= \\frac{3}{5} \\times 100\\%$\n    Percentage $= 0.6 \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$\n\nThus, the central cable carries 60% of the total weight."

    "question_text": "As shown in the figure, a rigid slab CD of weight W (distributed uniformly along its length) is hung from a ceiling using three cables of identical length and cross-sectional area. The central cable is made of steel (Young’s modulus = 3E) and the other two cables are made of aluminium (Young’s modulus = E). The percentage of the total weight taken by the central cable is ______ % (round off to the nearest integer)."
