        "reasoning": "The factor of safety (FOS) is the ratio of allowable shear stress to the actual maximum shear stress. The solid shaft is designed with FOS=2, so its maximum stress under torque T is half the allowable stress. For the same outer radius R and applied torque T, the maximum shear stress in the hollow shaft (with inner radius R/2) is higher than in the solid shaft. The new FOS for the hollow shaft is calculated as the ratio of the solid shaft's FOS multiplied by the inverse ratio of their maximum shear stresses: $FOS_{hollow} = FOS_{solid} \\times (\\tau_{max, solid} / \\tau_{max, hollow})$. This calculation yields approximately 1.875, which rounds to 1.9 as per the answer key (1.8 to 1.9)."

For the same outer radius, the hollow shaft has lower weight but also lower torque capacity for the same max stress. The factor of safety is proportional to torque capacity for a given applied torque. This leads to the same ratio derived from stress.",
