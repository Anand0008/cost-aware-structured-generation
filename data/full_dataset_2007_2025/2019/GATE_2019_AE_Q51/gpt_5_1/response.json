The solid shaft is designed for torque $T$ with factor of safety 2, so its allowable torque is $T_{allow,solid} = 2T$. For the same material and outer radius, the ratio of allowable torques equals the ratio of polar moments: $T_{allow,hollow}/T_{allow,solid} = J_{hollow}/J_{solid}$. With inner radius $R_i = R/2$, $J_{solid} = \\pi R^4/2$ and $J_{hollow} = \\pi (R^4 - (R/2)^4)/2 = J_{solid}(1 - 1/16) = (15/16)J_{solid}$. Thus $T_{allow,hollow} = (15/16) T_{allow,solid} = (15/16) \\cdot 2T = 1.875T$. Since the applied torque remains $T$, the new factor of safety is $FOS_{hollow} = T_{allow,hollow}/T = 1.875 \\approx 1.9$, matching the official range 1.8 to 1.9."
