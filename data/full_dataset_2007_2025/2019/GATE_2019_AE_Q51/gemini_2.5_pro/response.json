          "Step 2: Calculate the polar moment of inertia for the solid shaft ($J_{solid}$). For a solid circular shaft with radius $R$, the diameter is $d = 2R$. Thus, $J_{solid} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{32} = \\frac{\\pi (2R)^4}{32} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$.",

          "Step 4: Use the factor of safety definition to find the allowable shear stress ($\\tau_{allowable}$). $FoS_{solid} = \\frac{\\tau_{allowable}}{\\tau_{max,solid}}$.

          "Step 6: Calculate the polar moment of inertia for the hollow shaft ($J_{hollow}$). $J_{hollow} = \\frac{\\pi (d_o^4 - d_i^4)}{32} = \\frac{\\pi ((2R)^4 - R^4)}{32} = \\frac{\\pi (16R^4 - R^4)}{32} = \\frac{15 \\pi R^4}{32}$.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 provided excellent and highly relevant information regarding torsion formulas, polar moment of inertia for solid and hollow shafts, maximum shear stress, and the comparison between solid and hollow shafts, including the concept of factor of safety. Chunk 6 on membrane analogy was less directly applicable but provided conceptual context. The RAG content was very helpful for solving this question."

It is proposed to replace the solid shaft by a hollow shaft of the same material and identical outer radius. If the inner radius is half the outer radius, the factor of safety for the hollow shaft is _____ (round off to 1 decimal place)."
