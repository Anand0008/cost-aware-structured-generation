For incompressible flow over a bluff body like a cylinder, dynamic similarity is ensured when the Reynolds number of the model is equal to that of the prototype. Given that both experiments are conducted with air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), the fluid properties (density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$) are the same for both the prototype and the model. By equating the Reynolds numbers, the required free stream velocity for the wind tunnel experiment can be calculated."
