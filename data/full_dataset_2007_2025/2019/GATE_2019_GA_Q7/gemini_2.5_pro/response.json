First, calculate the number of mobile phone owners, then the number of internet users among them, and finally the number of e-commerce buyers. The final step is to express these buyers as a percentage of the total country population.\n\n1.  Total population = 1400 million.\n2.  Mobile phone owners = 70% of 1400 million = $0.70 \\times 1400 = 980$ million.\n3.  Internet users among mobile phone owners = 294 million (given).\n4.  E-commerce buyers among Internet users = Half of 294 million = $294 / 2 = 147$ million.\n5.  Percentage of these buyers in the country = (Number of buyers / Total population) $\\times 100\\%$\n    $= (147 \\text{ million} / 1400 \\text{ million}) \\times 100\\%$\n    $= (147 / 1400) \\times 100\\%$\n    $= 0.105 \\times 100\\%$\n    $= 10.50\\%$\n\nThis matches option A."
