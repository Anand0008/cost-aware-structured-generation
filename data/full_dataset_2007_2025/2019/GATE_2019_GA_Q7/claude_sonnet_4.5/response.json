Calculate the number of mobile phone owners:\n   - 70% of 1400 million = 0.7 * 1400 = 980 million\n\n2. Calculate the number of Internet users among mobile phone owners:\n   - 294 million\n\n3. Calculate the number of buyers among the Internet users:\n   - Half of 294 million = 0.5 * 294 = 147 million\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of buyers in the country:\n   - Percentage = (147 million / 1400 million) * 100 = 10.50%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 10.50%."
