        "reasoning": "The beam is simply supported at P and R with a central point load of 200 N and a clockwise concentrated moment of 100 Nm at midspan Q. First, find reactions from vertical force equilibrium: symmetry gives R_P = R_R = 100 N. For 0 \\le x < 0.5 m (left half), there is no distributed load, so shear is constant V = 100 N and bending moment varies linearly: M(x) = R_P x. At Q (x = 0.5 m), just to the left, M_Q^- = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50 Nm (sagging, taken positive). A concentrated moment causes a jump in the bending moment diagram equal to its magnitude, without changing shear. The applied 100 Nm at Q is clockwise; with the usual sign convention (sagging positive), this produces a positive jump of +50 Nm, so M_Q^+ = M_Q^- + 100 = 150 Nm, or, if the sign of the applied moment is opposite, a negative jump of 100 Nm giving M_Q^+ = -50 Nm. The figure in the question labels the jump magnitude as 100 Nm and shows the right span with zero moment, which implies that the net moment at Q after the jump is zero. That is only possible if the internal moment from the shear (50 Nm) is exactly cancelled by the external applied moment (100 Nm) in the opposite sense, so M_Q^+ = 0. Therefore the BMD must rise linearly from 0 at P to 100 Nm at Q (the diagram is scaled so that the peak value is labeled 100 Nm, representing the internal moment just before the jump), then drop vertically to 0 at Q due to the applied couple, and remain zero up to R. Among the options, diagram A uniquely shows a linear increase from P to Q reaching the labeled 100 Nm, followed by a vertical drop to zero and zero moment from Q to R, which matches the qualitative behavior: linear variation under constant shear, zero moment at simple supports, and a jump at the applied couple."

          "For the left segment P–Q (no distributed load), shear is constant V = 100 N, so bending moment varies linearly: M(x) = R_P x. At Q (x = 0.5 m), M_Q^- = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50 Nm (positive sagging).",
          "A concentrated moment causes an instantaneous jump in the bending moment diagram equal to its magnitude; shear is unaffected. The applied 100 Nm at Q changes the internal moment by 100 Nm at that point.",
          "The supports are simple, so M_P = M_R = 0. The only way to satisfy zero moment at R with no further loads is for the moment just to the right of Q to be zero, so the jump at Q must bring the moment from its linear value back to zero.",
          "Thus the BMD must: start at 0 at P, increase linearly to a peak at Q, then drop vertically to 0 at Q due to the applied couple, and remain zero up to R. Option A is the only diagram with this shape."
