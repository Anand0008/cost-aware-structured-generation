        "notes": "The RAG chunks provided information on properties of unitary/orthogonal matrices, eigenvalues of inverse/triangular matrices, and complex/repeated eigenvalues. While related to eigenvalues, none of the chunks directly provided the fundamental properties (sum=trace, product=determinant) needed to solve this specific problem. The solution relied on internal knowledge of these basic eigenvalue properties."
