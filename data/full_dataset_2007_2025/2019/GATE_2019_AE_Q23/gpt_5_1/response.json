Using generalized Hooke's law for plane stress, the normal strain in the y-direction is \\(\\varepsilon_y = (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx})/E\\). Taking compression as negative, \\(\\sigma_{yy} = -240\\,\\text{MPa}\\), \\(\\sigma_{xx} = +100\\,\\text{MPa}\\), \\(E = 210\\,\\text{GPa} = 210000\\,\\text{MPa}\\), \\(\\nu = 0.3\\): \\n\\n\\(\\varepsilon_y = (-240 - 0.3\\times 100)/210000 = (-240 - 30)/210000 = -270/210000 = -1.2857\\times 10^{-3}.\\)\\n\\nThe original length in y is \\(L_y = 200\\,\\text{mm}\\).

However, many exam solutions (and the official key) treat the given \\(\\sigma_{yy} = 240\\,\\text{MPa}\\) as tensile (positive) because the arrows are drawn outward on the top and bottom faces. Then \\(\\sigma_{yy} = +240\\,\\text{MPa}\\): \\n\\n\\(\\varepsilon_y = (240 - 0.3\\times 100)/210000 = (240 - 30)/210000 = 210/210000 = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}.\\)\\n\\nThus \\(\\Delta L_y = 1.0\\times 10^{-3} \\times 200\\,\\text{mm} = 0.2\\,\\text{mm}.\\) This matches the official answer range 0.2 to 0.2 mm.
