        "reasoning": "The given system of equations is a homogeneous system, meaning all right-hand side constants are zero. A homogeneous system $Ax = 0$ always has at least the trivial solution ($x=0, y=0, z=0$). To determine if it has a unique solution (only the trivial solution) or infinitely many solutions, we need to evaluate the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$. If $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, there is a unique solution. If $\\det(A) = 0$, there are infinitely many solutions. \\n\\nThe coefficient matrix is: \\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ \\n\\nCalculating the determinant: \\n$\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}$ \\n$\\det(A) = 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))$ \\n$\\det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)$ \\n$\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)$ \\n$\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3$ \\n$\\det(A) = 0$ \\n\\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, and it is a homogeneous system, the system has an infinite number of solutions. This aligns with the condition `rank(A) = rank([A|b]) < n` for infinite solutions, as `rank(A) < 3` when `det(A) = 0` for a 3x3 matrix, and `rank([A|b])` is always equal to `rank(A)` for a homogeneous system."
