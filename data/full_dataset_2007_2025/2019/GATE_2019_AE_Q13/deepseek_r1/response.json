If the load is applied through the SC, the net torque about the beam's longitudinal axis due to the internal shear stress distribution is zero, meaning the twist per unit length ($\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$) is zero. Option B is false: shear stress is not uniform; it varies based on the cross-section geometry and load. Option C is false: bending stresses are induced by the bending moment caused by the shear force; they are not zero. Option D is false: shear strain is related to shear stress and is not zero at the SC; it's the twisting deformation that is zero."

          "Step 3: Relate 'no twisting' to 'twist per unit length'. The absence of twisting means the rate of change of the angle of twist along the beam's length is zero, i.e., twist per unit length is zero.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the incorrect options. Option B: Shear stress distribution in beams is non-uniform (e.g., parabolic in rectangular sections, varies in thin-walled sections). Option C: Bending stresses are generated by the bending moment; a shear force inherently produces a bending moment. Option D: Shear strain is a function of shear stress and material properties; it exists where shear stress exists and is not defined to be zero at a specific point like the SC."
