If there is no twisting, then the twist per unit length (which is a measure of the rate of change of twist along the beam's length) must be zero. This definition is consistently supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).

          "Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding. Option A directly states that 'the twist per unit length is zero', which is a direct consequence of applying the load through the shear center to prevent torsion.",
          "Step 5: Dismiss other options. Option B (uniform shear stress) is generally false; shear stress distribution varies across the cross-section. Option C (zero bending stresses) is false; a transverse shear load *causes* bending, hence bending stresses will be present. Option D (zero shear strain at shear center) is also false; shear strain is related to shear stress, and shear stresses are present throughout the section due to the shear load."
