        "reasoning": "The key reason why the propulsive efficiency of a ramjet engine is lower than that of a low bypass turbofan engine under the same conditions is that the ramjet engine has larger kinetic energy lost in the exhaust jet. This is because ramjets have a higher exhaust velocity (`V9`) compared to the flight velocity (`V0`), resulting in a lower propulsive efficiency given by the formula `eta_p = (2 * V0) / (V9 + V0)`. In contrast, low bypass turbofan engines are designed to have a lower `V9` closer to `V0`, thereby achieving higher propulsive efficiency."
