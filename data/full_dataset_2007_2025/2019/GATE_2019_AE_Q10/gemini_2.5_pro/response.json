        "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) is defined as the ratio of useful thrust power to the kinetic energy added to the air by the engine. It is given by the formula $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_e + V_a}$, where $V_a$ is the flight velocity and $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity. To maximize propulsive efficiency, the exhaust velocity $V_e$ should be as close as possible to the flight velocity $V_a$. Thrust ($T$) is given by $T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_a)$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is the mass flow rate of air. For a given thrust and flight velocity, if $V_e$ is very high (as in a ramjet), then the term $(V_e - V_a)$ is large, implying that a smaller mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_a$ is needed. However, a large $V_e$ also means that a significant amount of kinetic energy, $0.5 \\dot{m}_a (V_e^2 - V_a^2)$, is imparted to the exhaust jet, much of which is 'wasted' as kinetic energy of the exhaust relative to the ambient air. This 'lost' kinetic energy is higher when $V_e$ is much greater than $V_a$. Ramjets typically operate with very high exhaust velocities, resulting in a large difference between $V_e$ and $V_a$. In contrast, a low bypass turbofan engine, by accelerating a larger mass of air (both core and bypass streams) to a lower average exhaust velocity, brings $V_e$ closer to $V_a$. This minimizes the kinetic energy lost in the exhaust jet for the same thrust, leading to higher propulsive efficiency. Therefore, a ramjet engine has lower propulsive efficiency primarily because it has larger kinetic energy lost in the exhaust jet."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the definition of propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$). It measures how effectively the kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust stream is converted into useful thrust work. The formula is $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_e + V_a}$, where $V_a$ is flight velocity and $V_e$ is exhaust velocity.",
          "Step 2: Recall the thrust equation, $T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_a)$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is the mass flow rate of air.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the condition for high propulsive efficiency. From the formula, $\\eta_p$ is maximized when $V_e$ is close to $V_a$. This implies a small difference $(V_e - V_a)$.",
          "Step 4: Compare ramjet and turbofan characteristics. A ramjet is a single-stream engine that produces thrust by expelling a relatively small mass of air at a very high exhaust velocity ($V_e$). A turbofan, especially with bypass, accelerates a larger mass of air (both through the core and bypass duct) to a lower average exhaust velocity for the same thrust.",
          "Step 5: Relate exhaust velocity to kinetic energy loss. When $V_e$ is significantly higher than $V_a$ (as in a ramjet), a large amount of kinetic energy is left in the exhaust jet relative to the ambient air. This kinetic energy, $0.5 \\dot{m}_a (V_e^2 - V_a^2)$, represents energy that is not efficiently converted into useful propulsive work, thus lowering propulsive efficiency.",
          "Step 6: Conclude based on the comparison. Since a ramjet operates with a much higher exhaust velocity relative to flight speed compared to a turbofan (for the same thrust and flight speed), it inherently 'wastes' more kinetic energy in its exhaust jet. This directly leads to lower propulsive efficiency for the ramjet."
