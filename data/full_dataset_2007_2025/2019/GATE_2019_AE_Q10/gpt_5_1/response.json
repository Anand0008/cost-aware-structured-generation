        "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency \\(\\eta_p\\) measures how effectively the kinetic energy added to the jet is converted into useful propulsive power. For a given flight speed \\(V_0\\) and thrust \\(T\\), higher propulsive efficiency corresponds to a smaller velocity difference between jet and flight, i.e., lower kinetic energy left in the exhaust. Ramjets typically operate with very high exhaust velocities relative to the flight speed (high specific thrust), while low-bypass turbofans accelerate a larger mass flow to a smaller velocity increment. From the standard expression \\(\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_0}{V_j + V_0}\\) (single-stream ideal case), a larger \\(V_j\\) for the same \\(V_0\\) gives a lower \\(\\eta_p\\). Physically this means more kinetic energy is wasted in the exhaust jet for the ramjet. Options B, C, and D do not directly define propulsive efficiency: thrust power can be the same for both engines by construction, self-starting capability is unrelated, and higher thrust-to-weight ratio does not inherently reduce propulsive efficiency. Therefore, the primary reason is option A: larger kinetic energy lost in the exhaust jet."
