There are 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers.\\nFor numbers to alternate, the sequence must be of the form Even-Odd-Even-Odd-Even (E O E O E). This means $N_1, N_3, N_5$ must be even, and $N_2, N_4$ must be odd.\\n\\n**Rule 2: The second number from the left ($N_2$) is exactly half of the left-most number ($N_1$).**\\nFrom the given numbers, we need to find a pair $(N_1, N_2)$ such that $N_1$ is even, $N_2$ is odd, and $N_1 = 2 \\times N_2$.\\n- If $N_1 = 10$ (even), then $N_2 = 10/2 = 5$ (odd).

Since there are 3 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, the sequence must follow the pattern Even-Odd-Even-Odd-Even (E O E O E). This means $N_1, N_3, N_5$ are even, and $N_2, N_4$ are odd.",
