The change in height between center and wall is therefore $\\Delta z = z(R) - z(0) = \\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{2g}$. In the problem, the free surface at the wall is raised by $h_1$ and at the center is lowered by $h_2$ relative to the original flat level. Volume conservation requires that the average height of the free surface remains equal to the initial height $h_0$. For a paraboloid of revolution over a circular base, the average height is the mean of the minimum and maximum heights, so the upward and downward displacements must be equal: $h_1 = h_2$. Given $h_1 = 10$ cm, we obtain $h_2 = 10$ cm, matching the official key."
