A key principle for such systems, derived from the conservation of fluid volume, is that the initial undisturbed free surface height is exactly halfway between the minimum height (at the center, r=0) and the maximum height (at the wall, r=R) of the paraboloid. Let the initial undisturbed height be $h_0$. The maximum height of the free surface is $z_{max} = h_0 + h_1$ (at $r=R$), and the minimum height is $z_{min} = h_0 - h_2$ (at $r=0$). According to the volume conservation principle for a paraboloid of revolution, the original free surface level $h_0$ is the average of $z_{max}$ and $z_{min}$.\\nThus, $h_0 = \\frac{z_{max} + z_{min}}{2}$.\\nSubstituting the expressions for $z_{max}$ and $z_{min}$:\\n$h_0 = \\frac{(h_0 + h_1) + (h_0 - h_2)}{2}$\\n$2h_0 = 2h_0 + h_1 - h_2$\\n$0 = h_1 - h_2$\\nTherefore, $h_1 = h_2$.\\nGiven $h_1 = 10$ cm, the downward displacement $h_2$ must also be $10$ cm."

The height of the free surface $z(r)$ for a fluid rotating with angular velocity $\\omega$ is given by the equation of a paraboloid: $z(r) = z_{min} + \\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g}$, where $z_{min}$ is the height at the center ($r=0$).",

Due to the conservation of fluid volume, the initial undisturbed free surface height $h_0$ is exactly halfway between the minimum height ($z_{min}$) at the center and the maximum height ($z_{max}$) at the container wall.",
          "Step 4: Express the maximum and minimum heights in terms of the given displacements. From the image and problem description, the maximum height at $r=R$ is $z_{max} = h_0 + h_1$. The minimum height at $r=0$ is $z_{min} = h_0 - h_2$.",
          "Step 5: Apply the volume conservation principle (average height property). The initial height $h_0$ is the average of $z_{max}$ and $z_{min}$: $h_0 = \\frac{z_{max} + z_{min}}{2}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 5 and solve for the relationship between $h_1$ and $h_2$. $h_0 = \\frac{(h_0 + h_1) + (h_0 - h_2)}{2} \\implies 2h_0 = 2h_0 + h_1 - h_2 \\implies 0 = h_1 - h_2 \\implies h_1 = h_2$.",
