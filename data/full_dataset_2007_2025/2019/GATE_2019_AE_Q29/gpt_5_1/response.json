        "reasoning": "Compressor isentropic efficiency decrease means for the same pressure ratio the compressor exit temperature T_{t2} increases above the ideal value. Turbine inlet temperature T_{t4} is fixed. Thus the temperature rise across the combustor (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) decreases, so heat added per kg of air decreases. However, because the compressor is less efficient, the compressor work per kg air increases: W_c = c_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2,inlet}). To supply this higher compressor work, the turbine must extract more work from the gas, which for fixed T_{t4} implies a larger temperature drop across the turbine and therefore a higher fuel flow to maintain T_{t4} against all losses in a real engine. In turbojet performance, thrust specific fuel consumption TSFC is defined as TSFC = \\dot{m}_f / F. A less efficient compressor increases required turbine work and fuel flow for essentially similar thrust level (or even slightly reduced thrust because more energy is internally consumed). Hence TSFC increases. Option C correctly states that TSFC increases because the compressor needs more work input from the turbine. Options A and D incorrectly claim TSFC decreases, and B incorrectly claims no change."

          "Step 3: Compressor work per unit mass increases because W_c = c_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2}) and T_{t3} is higher for the same inlet state and pressure ratio when efficiency is lower.",
          "Step 4: The turbine must provide this extra compressor work, so more of the fuel energy is spent internally, leaving relatively less for producing jet kinetic energy and thrust.",
          "Step 5: Thrust specific fuel consumption TSFC = \\dot{m}_f / F therefore increases: \\dot{m}_f rises (to support higher internal work) while F does not increase proportionally and may even decrease.",

They did not directly address compressor efficiency vs TSFC, but provided useful background on how non-ideal components alter temperatures and work, supporting the reasoning. Core answer relied on standard gas turbine theory beyond RAG."
