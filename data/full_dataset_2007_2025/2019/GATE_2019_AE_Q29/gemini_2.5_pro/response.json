        "reasoning": "A decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) means that for a given pressure ratio, the actual work required by the compressor ($W_c$) increases. This leads to a higher actual compressor outlet temperature ($T_{02a}$). Since the turbine inlet temperature ($T_{03}$) is constant, the heat added in the combustor ($Q_{in} = c_p (T_{03} - T_{02a})$) decreases, which means the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) decreases. However, the increased compressor work must be supplied by the turbine ($W_t = W_c$). With a fixed $T_{03}$, this means the turbine extracts more energy, resulting in a lower turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$). A lower $T_{04a}$ implies less energy available for expansion in the nozzle, leading to a reduction in exhaust velocity and thus a decrease in thrust ($F$). The engine is performing less efficiently overall. Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) is defined as $\\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$. Although $\\dot{m}_f$ decreases, the thrust $F$ decreases even more significantly due to the increased internal work consumption by the inefficient compressor, leading to a net *increase* in TSFC. Therefore, option C is correct, as the compressor needing more work input from the turbine is the root cause of the reduced net thrust output relative to fuel input."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the effect of decreasing compressor efficiency. A decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) means that for a given pressure ratio and inlet temperature ($T_{01}$), the actual work input required by the compressor ($W_c$) increases, and consequently, the actual compressor outlet temperature ($T_{02a}$) increases. This is because $\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02a} - T_{01}}$, so if $\\eta_c$ decreases while $T_{02s}$ (isentropic temperature rise for a given pressure ratio) and $T_{01}$ are constant, $T_{02a}$ must increase.",
          "Step 2: Analyze heat input and fuel flow. The heat added in the combustor ($Q_{in}$) is proportional to $(T_{03} - T_{02a})$. Given that the turbine inlet temperature ($T_{03}$) remains constant and $T_{02a}$ increases (from Step 1), the temperature difference $(T_{03} - T_{02a})$ decreases. Therefore, the heat input $Q_{in}$ and the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) decrease.",
          "Step 3: Analyze turbine work and exit temperature. In a turbojet engine, the turbine work ($W_t$) is equal to the compressor work ($W_c$). Since $W_c$ increases (due to lower compressor efficiency, as established in Step 1), $W_t$ also increases. With a constant $T_{03}$, an increase in $W_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04a})$ implies that the turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$) must decrease.",
          "Step 4: Analyze thrust generation. A lower turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$) means less energy is available for expansion in the nozzle. This leads to a lower exhaust velocity ($V_e$) and consequently a lower thrust ($F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_a)$).",
          "Step 5: Determine the trend of TSFC. Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) is defined as $\\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$. We found that $\\dot{m}_f$ decreases (Step 2) and $F$ decreases (Step 4). However, the fundamental consequence of reduced component efficiency is a reduction in overall engine efficiency. A less efficient engine will consume more fuel per unit of thrust produced, meaning its TSFC will increase. The decrease in thrust is proportionally larger than the decrease in fuel flow because the increased internal work consumption by the compressor directly reduces the net useful work (thrust power)."
