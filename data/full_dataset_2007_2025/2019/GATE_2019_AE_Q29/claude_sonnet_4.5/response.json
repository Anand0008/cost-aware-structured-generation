        "reasoning": "The question states that the compressor outlet temperature increases with decreasing compressor efficiency, while the turbine inlet temperature remains constant. This means that the temperature rise across the combustor (T03 - T02) increases, requiring more fuel to be added to reach the same turbine inlet temperature. As a result, the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of the engine will increase, as the fuel flow rate increases while the thrust remains unchanged. This is consistent with option C, which is the correct answer."
