        "reasoning": "Decreasing compressor efficiency increases compressor outlet temperature (T02) for a given pressure ratio. With constant turbine inlet temperature (T03), the temperature rise across the combustor (T03 - T02) decreases, reducing heat addition and fuel flow rate. However, the compressor requires more work input, which must be extracted from the turbine. This reduces the enthalpy available for acceleration in the nozzle, decreasing specific thrust. The net effect is that thrust decreases more significantly than fuel flow, causing Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) to increase. This aligns with standard gas turbine performance analysis where component inefficiencies degrade overall efficiency and increase fuel consumption per unit thrust."

          "Step 3: Analyze the effect on fuel flow. Heat added in the combustor: $Q_{in} = c_p (T_{03} - T_{02})$. As T02 increases and T03 is constant, $Q_{in}$ decreases. Assuming constant combustion efficiency and fuel heating value, fuel flow rate $\\\\dot{m}_f$ decreases.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect on thrust. Compressor work per unit mass: $W_c = c_p (T_{02} - T_{01})$. Lower efficiency means higher T02 for the same pressure ratio, so $W_c$ increases. The turbine must provide this extra work: $W_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04}) = W_c$. Thus, T04 decreases significantly. The lower turbine exit temperature (T04) and potentially lower nozzle inlet pressure reduce exhaust velocity and specific thrust.",
          "Step 5: Combine effects on TSFC. Although fuel flow decreases, thrust decreases even more due to the higher parasitic compressor work. Therefore, the ratio $\\\\dot{m}_f / F$ (TSFC) increases.",
