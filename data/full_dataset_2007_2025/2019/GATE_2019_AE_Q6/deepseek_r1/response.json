        "reasoning": "For quasi-one-dimensional, isentropic flow, the area-velocity relation dictates that in a diverging duct (dA/A > 0), a supersonic flow (M > 1) accelerates (dV/V > 0, so dM > 0). The isentropic energy equation (or the temperature-Mach number relation) dictates that for an accelerating flow, static temperature decreases. This is a direct and fundamental consequence of the governing equations for compressible flow. Chunks 1, 3, and 6 explicitly state that supersonic flow accelerates in a diverging duct, and Chunk 6 gives the relation dT/T = -(\\gamma - 1) M^2 (dV/V), confirming temperature decrease with acceleration."

Therefore, for a diverging duct where dA/A > 0, we must have dV/V > 0. This means the velocity (and hence the Mach number, since the speed of sound is a function of temperature) increases in the flow direction.",
          "Step 3: To determine the static temperature trend, use the energy equation for adiabatic flow (which holds for isentropic flow). The total temperature T_0 is constant. The relation between static and total temperature is T_0 = T (1 + (\\gamma - 1)/2 * M^2). As M increases, the term (1 + (\\gamma - 1)/2 * M^2) increases, so for constant T_0, the static temperature T must decrease. Alternatively, from the differential relation in Chunk 6: dT/T = -(\\gamma - 1) M^2 (dV/V). Since dV/V > 0, dT/T < 0, confirming static temperature decreases.",

        "notes": "RAG context was highly relevant. Chunks 1, 3, and 6 directly provided the area-velocity relation and the temperature-velocity relation, confirming the correct answer. Chunk 2 provided supporting context on choked flow. Chunks 4 and 5 were less directly relevant but still related. The retrieved knowledge from video lectures and textbooks matched the required concepts perfectly, reducing reliance on internal knowledge."
