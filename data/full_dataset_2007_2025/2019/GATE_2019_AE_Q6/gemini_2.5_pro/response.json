        "reasoning": "The question asks about the behavior of Mach number and static temperature for a quasi-one-dimensional isentropic supersonic flow through a diverging duct. \\n\\n1.  **Mach Number Change:**\\n    The area-velocity relation for quasi-one-dimensional isentropic flow is given by: \\n    `$$\\frac{dA}{A} = (M^2 - 1) \\frac{dV}{V}$$`\\n    or equivalently, `$$\\frac{dV}{V} = \\frac{1}{(M^2 - 1)} \\frac{dA}{A}$$` (from RAG Chunk 1, 6). \\n    For a diverging duct, the area `A` increases in the direction of flow, so `$\\frac{dA}{A} > 0$`.\\n    For supersonic flow, the Mach number `M > 1`, which means `$(M^2 - 1) > 0$`.\\n    Therefore, `$\\frac{dV}{V} = \\frac{1}{(positive)} \\times (positive) > 0$`. This implies that the velocity `V` increases in the direction of flow. Since Mach number `M = V/a` (where `a` is the speed of sound), an increase in velocity `V` leads to an increase in Mach number `M` (assuming `a` doesn't decrease drastically to counteract this, which it doesn't in this context). \\n    RAG Chunk 3 explicitly states: \"Supersonic Incoming Flow (M > 1): In a diverging nozzle, supersonic flow accelerates, meaning the Mach number increases...\".\\n\\n2.  **Static Temperature Change:**\\n    For isentropic flow, the stagnation temperature `T_0` remains constant. The relation between stagnation temperature and static temperature is given by the energy equation: \\n    `$$T_0 = T + \\frac{V^2}{2c_p}$$`\\n    where `T` is the static temperature, `V` is the flow velocity, and `c_p` is the specific heat at constant pressure. \\n    Since `T_0` is constant and we established that `V` (and thus `V^2`) increases in the direction of flow, for the sum to remain constant, the static temperature `T` must decrease.\\n    Alternatively, using the differential relation for isentropic flow (from RAG Chunk 6): \\n    `$$\\frac{dT}{T} = -(\\gamma - 1) M^2 \\frac{dV}{V}$$`\\n    We know `$\\frac{dV}{V} > 0$`, `$(\\gamma - 1) > 0$` (for air, `$\\gamma = 1.4$`), and `M^2 > 0`. Therefore, `$\\frac{dT}{T} < 0$`, which means the static temperature `T` decreases in the direction of flow. \\n    RAG Chunk 3 explicitly states: \"Supersonic diverging: `M` increases => ... `T` decreases (relative to `T_0`)\".\\n\\nCombining these two findings, the Mach number increases and the static temperature decreases. This corresponds to option B."

          "Step 3: Analyze the terms in the area-velocity relation. For a diverging duct, the area `A` increases, so `$\\frac{dA}{A} > 0$`. For supersonic flow, the Mach number `M > 1`, which means `$(M^2 - 1) > 0$`.",
          "Step 4: Deduce the change in velocity and Mach number. Since `$\\frac{dA}{A} > 0$` and `$(M^2 - 1) > 0$`, it implies that `$\\frac{dV}{V}$` must also be `$> 0$`. Therefore, the flow velocity `V` increases, and consequently, the Mach number `M` increases in the direction of flow.",
          "Step 5: Recall the energy equation for isentropic flow, which relates static temperature `T` to flow velocity `V` and constant stagnation temperature `T_0`: `$$T_0 = T + \\frac{V^2}{2c_p}$$`.",
          "Step 6: Deduce the change in static temperature. Since `T_0` is constant for isentropic flow and `V` (and thus `V^2`) increases (as determined in Step 4), the static temperature `T` must decrease to maintain the constant sum. Alternatively, using the differential relation `$\\frac{dT}{T} = -(\\gamma - 1) M^2 \\frac{dV}{V}$`, since `$\\frac{dV}{V} > 0$`, `$\\frac{dT}{T}$` must be `$< 0$`, indicating a decrease in static temperature.",

Chunk 2 was less directly relevant but provided context on C-D nozzles."
