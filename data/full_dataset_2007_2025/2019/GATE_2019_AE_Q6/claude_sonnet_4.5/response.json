According to the area-velocity relation, for supersonic flow in a diverging duct, the Mach number increases in the direction of flow, while the static temperature decreases. This is because the area increase causes the velocity to increase, and the temperature must decrease to satisfy the isentropic flow relations. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
