        "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement P: It is caused by flow separation resulting from large rudder deflection.**\n*   Adverse yaw is a phenomenon primarily associated with aileron deflection, not rudder deflection. Rudder is used to *counteract* adverse yaw, not cause it (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3). While large rudder deflection can cause flow separation and increased drag, this is not the mechanism for adverse yaw. Therefore, statement P is incorrect.\n\n**Statement Q: It is caused by dissimilar drag forces acting on the two halves of the wing resulting from aileron deflections of same magnitude.**\n*   This statement accurately describes the cause of adverse yaw. When a pilot initiates a roll (e.g., to the right), the left aileron deflects downward (increasing lift and induced drag on the left wing), and the right aileron deflects upward (decreasing lift and induced drag on the right wing). The increased drag on the 'down' aileron wing (left wing in this example) and decreased drag on the 'up' aileron wing (right wing) creates a differential drag. This differential drag generates a yawing moment that opposes the direction of the turn (i.e., yaws the nose to the left for a right roll). This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, statement Q is correct.\n\n**Statement R: It can be eliminated by ensuring that the upward deflection of one aileron is greater than the downward deflection of the opposite aileron.**\n*   This describes the principle of 'differential ailerons'. Differential ailerons are a design feature where the upward deflection of an aileron is made greater than its downward deflection for the same control stick input. The purpose of this design is to reduce the induced drag on the wing with the downward-deflected aileron and increase the form drag on the wing with the upward-deflected aileron, thereby reducing or compensating for the adverse yawing moment. While 'eliminated' is a strong word (it's often reduced or compensated for rather than completely eliminated), this is the primary design technique to mitigate adverse yaw. RAG Chunks 1 and 2 mention differential ailerons as a technique to reduce adverse yaw. Therefore, statement R is correct.\n\nSince statements Q and R are correct, option D is the correct answer."

Recall that rudder is used for directional control and to *counteract* adverse yaw, not to cause it. Flow separation due to large rudder deflection is a separate aerodynamic phenomenon. Conclude that P is incorrect.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement Q. Examine the mechanism of aileron deflection. When ailerons are deflected for a roll, one wing's aileron goes down (increasing lift and induced drag), and the other's goes up (decreasing lift and induced drag). This differential drag creates the adverse yawing moment. Conclude that Q is correct.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement R. Consider methods to mitigate adverse yaw. Differential ailerons, where the upward deflection is greater than the downward deflection, are a common design technique to reduce the adverse yawing moment by balancing the drag forces. Conclude that R is correct.",
