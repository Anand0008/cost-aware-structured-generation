        "reasoning": "The correct answer is D (Q and R). \n\nQ is correct because adverse yaw is caused by dissimilar drag forces acting on the two halves of the wing resulting from aileron deflections of the same magnitude. When one aileron goes down, it increases lift and induced drag on that wing, while the opposite aileron going up decreases lift and induced drag on the other wing. This differential drag creates an adverse yawing moment.\n\nR is also correct because differential aileron deflection, where the upward deflection of one aileron is greater than the downward deflection of the opposite aileron, can help eliminate or reduce adverse yaw. This differential deflection helps balance the drag forces and minimize the adverse yawing moment.\n\nP is incorrect because adverse yaw is not caused by flow separation due to large rudder deflection. Rudder deflection is used to counteract adverse yaw, not cause it."
