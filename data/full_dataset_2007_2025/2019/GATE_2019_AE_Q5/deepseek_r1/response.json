The velocity potential is a scalar function whose gradient gives the velocity vector: \\(\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi\\). This definition is mathematically valid only if the curl of the velocity field is zero (\\(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0\\)), which is the condition for irrotational flow. Option A (Laplace's equation) requires an additional condition of incompressibility. Option C (zero divergence) is the condition for incompressibility, which is not guaranteed by the existence of a potential. Option D presents the definition of the stream function in 2D, not the velocity potential."

This is a necessary and sufficient condition from vector calculus.",

Option C, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0\\), is the continuity equation for incompressible flow, which is not a necessary condition for a potential to exist.
