        "reasoning": "The existence of a velocity potential $\\phi$ for a flow field $\\vec{V}$ is defined by the relationship $\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi$. A fundamental vector identity states that the curl of the gradient of any scalar function is identically zero, i.e., $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla f) = 0$ for any scalar function $f$. Applying this identity to the velocity potential, we get $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi) = 0$. Since $\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi$, it necessarily implies that $\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$. This condition defines an irrotational flow.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A. $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$ (Laplace's Equation):** This equation is valid only if the flow is *both* irrotational and incompressible (i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0$). The question only states that $\\phi$ is a velocity potential, which guarantees irrotationality, but not necessarily incompressibility. Therefore, this is not *necessarily* true.\n*   **C. $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0$ (Incompressible Flow):** This condition implies that the flow is incompressible. The existence of a velocity potential does not inherently mean the flow is incompressible. A compressible irrotational flow can still have a velocity potential, but it would not satisfy $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0$ (and thus not Laplace's equation).\n*   **D. $u = -\\partial \\phi / \\partial y, \\ v = \\partial \\phi / \\partial x$:** This set of equations relates velocity components to a *stream function* ($\\psi$) for a two-dimensional incompressible flow, not a velocity potential. For a velocity potential $\\phi$, the velocity components are defined as $u = \\partial \\phi / \\partial x$ and $v = \\partial \\phi / \\partial y$."

          "**Step 1: Understand the definition of velocity potential.** The question states that $\\phi(x, y)$ represents the velocity potential of a flow. By definition, the velocity vector $\\vec{V}$ of a flow is the gradient of its velocity potential $\\phi$. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi$.",
          "**Step 2: Recall the condition for the existence of a velocity potential.** A velocity potential can only be defined for a flow that is irrotational. This means that the vorticity of the flow must be zero.",
          "**Step 3: Relate vorticity to the curl operator.** Vorticity is mathematically defined as the curl of the velocity vector, $\\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{V}$. For an irrotational flow, $\\vec{\\omega} = 0$, so $\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$.",
          "**Step 4: Substitute the definition of velocity potential into the irrotationality condition.** Since $\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi$, we can substitute this into the irrotationality condition: $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi) = 0$.",
          "**Step 5: Apply the fundamental vector identity.** A fundamental identity in vector calculus states that the curl of the gradient of any continuously differentiable scalar function is always identically zero. That is, for any scalar function $f$, $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla f) = 0$.",
          "**Step 6: Conclude the necessary condition and evaluate options.** Based on the vector identity, if a velocity potential $\\phi$ exists, then $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi)$ must be zero. Therefore, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$ is a *necessary* consequence of the existence of a velocity potential. This makes option B the correct answer. Options A and C are only true under additional assumptions (incompressibility), and option D incorrectly defines velocity components for a potential function."
