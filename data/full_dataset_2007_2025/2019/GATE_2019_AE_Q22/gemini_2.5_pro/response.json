Only two independent elastic constants are needed, typically Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio ($\\mu$). From these two, other elastic constants such as the Shear Modulus (G) and Bulk Modulus (K) can be derived using established relationships (e.g., $E = 2G(1 + \\mu)$ and $E = 3K(1 - 2\\mu)$)."
