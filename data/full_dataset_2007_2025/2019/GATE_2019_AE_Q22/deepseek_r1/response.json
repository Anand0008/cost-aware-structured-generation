        "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of independent elastic constants for a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic material. From the RAG context and standard solid mechanics theory, a linear elastic material's constitutive relationship is described by the generalized Hooke's law, represented by a 4th order stiffness tensor C_ijkl. For a general anisotropic material, this tensor has up to 21 independent components due to symmetry. For an isotropic material, due to the inherent property of being identical in all directions, this number reduces drastically. The maximum symmetry imposes constraints such that only 2 independent material constants are required and sufficient to completely describe the stress-strain relationship. Common pairs are Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio (\\nu), or Shear Modulus (G) and Bulk Modulus (K). The RAG context (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5) explicitly states that for an isotropic linear elastic material, there are only 2 independent elastic constants. The GATE answer key confirms this as 2."
