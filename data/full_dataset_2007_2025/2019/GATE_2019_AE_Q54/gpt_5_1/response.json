Here, mass $m = 10\\,\\text{kg}$, stiffness $k = 10^3\\,\\text{N/m}$, damping coefficient $c = 20\\,\\text{kg/s}$. First compute the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m} = \\sqrt{1000/10} = 10\\,\\text{rad/s}$. Critical damping $c_c = 2m\\omega_n = 2 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 200\\,\\text{kg/s}$. Damping ratio $\\zeta = c/c_c = 20/200 = 0.1$. For underdamped motion, logarithmic decrement is $\\delta = \\dfrac{2\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\dfrac{2\\pi(0.1)}{\\sqrt{1-0.01}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.2\\pi}{0.995} \\approx 0.631$. The first to fifth cycle means there are 4 intervals (from cycle 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5), so $n = 4$. Thus, $\\dfrac{X_1}{X_5} = e^{4\\delta} = e^{4 \\times 0.631} = e^{2.524} \\approx 12.4$.

Overall, RAG was helpful for context and formulas, while the detailed multi-cycle application used internal knowledge."
