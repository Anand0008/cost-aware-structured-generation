Induced drag coefficient C_{D,i} = C_L^2 / (π e AR), so the ratio = (C_L_level / C_L_climb)^2 = (1/cos 30°)^2 = sec^2 30° = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333. This matches the answer key range of 1.32 to 1.35."

          "Step 4: For steady climb at angle θ, the forces perpendicular to flight path require lift to balance the weight component: L = W cos θ. Since speed and density are same, dynamic pressure $q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$ is constant, so C_L is proportional to lift. Thus, $C_{L,climb} = C_{L,level} \\cos \\theta$.",
