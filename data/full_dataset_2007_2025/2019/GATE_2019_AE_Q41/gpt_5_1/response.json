Then, for the climb, first compute the new lift coefficient using $C_{L,climb} = L_{climb}/(qS) = (W \\cos 30°)/(qS)$, which is $C_{L,level} \\cos 30°$, and then compute $C_{D,i,climb} = C_{L,climb}^2/(\\pi e AR)$. Finally, take the ratio of the two $C_{D,i}$ values.",

Some RAG content about L/Dmax and TR_min was not needed but reinforced understanding of induced drag behavior."
