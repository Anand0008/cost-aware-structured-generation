        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio of induced drag coefficients during steady level flight and a 30-degree climb, assuming constant flight speed and ambient density. \\n\\n1.  **Induced Drag Coefficient ($C_{D,i}$):** The formula for induced drag coefficient is given by $C_{D,i} = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}$.\\n\\n2.  **Lift in Steady Level Flight (SLF):** In steady level flight, the lift force ($L_{SLF}$) balances the aircraft's weight ($W$), so $L_{SLF} = W$. The lift coefficient for this condition ($C_{L,SLF}$) is given as 0.375.\\n\\n3.  **Lift in Steady Climb:** In a steady climb at a constant flight path angle $\\gamma$, the lift force ($L_{Climb}$) balances the component of weight perpendicular to the flight path. Thus, $L_{Climb} = W \\cos(\\gamma)$.\\n\\n4.  **Relationship between Lift Coefficients:** The lift force is also expressed as $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_L$. Since the problem states that the flight speed ($V_\\infty$) and ambient density ($\\rho_\\infty$) are the same for both conditions, and the wing area ($S$) is constant, the dynamic pressure ($q_\\infty = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2$) is constant. \\n    Therefore, $L \\propto C_L$. We can write:\\n    $\\frac{L_{Climb}}{L_{SLF}} = \\frac{C_{L,Climb}}{C_{L,SLF}}$\\n    Substituting the force relationships:\\n    $\\frac{W \\cos(\\gamma)}{W} = \\frac{C_{L,Climb}}{C_{L,SLF}}$\\n    This simplifies to $C_{L,Climb} = C_{L,SLF} \\cos(\\gamma)$.\\n\\n5.  **Ratio of Induced Drag Coefficients:** We need to find the ratio $\\frac{C_{D,i,SLF}}{C_{D,i,Climb}}$.\\n    $\\frac{C_{D,i,SLF}}{C_{D,i,Climb}} = \\frac{C_{L,SLF}^2 / (\\pi e AR)}{C_{L,Climb}^2 / (\\pi e AR)}$\\n    Since $\\pi e AR$ is constant for the aircraft, it cancels out:\\n    $\\frac{C_{D,i,SLF}}{C_{D,i,Climb}} = \\frac{C_{L,SLF}^2}{C_{L,Climb}^2}$\\n    Substitute $C_{L,Climb} = C_{L,SLF} \\cos(\\gamma)$ into the ratio:\\n    $\\frac{C_{D,i,SLF}}{C_{D,i,Climb}} = \\frac{C_{L,SLF}^2}{(C_{L,SLF} \\cos(\\gamma))^2} = \\frac{C_{L,SLF}^2}{C_{L,SLF}^2 \\cos^2(\\gamma)} = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\gamma)}$\\n\\n6.  **Calculation:** Given $\\gamma = 30^\\circ$.\\n    $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660$\\n    $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\\n    Ratio = $\\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.3333$\\n\\n7.  **Rounding:** Rounding off to two decimal places, the ratio is 1.33. This value falls within the acceptable range of 1.32 to 1.35 provided in the answer key."
