        "reasoning": "The question states that the flow through the nozzle is 'optimally expanded'. According to fundamental rocket propulsion principles (as confirmed by RAG chunks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), for an optimally expanded nozzle, the exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$). In this condition, the pressure thrust term in the general thrust equation becomes zero.\n\nThe general thrust equation for a rocket engine is:\n$F = \\dot{m} V_e + (P_e - P_a) A_e$\n\nWhere:\n*   $F$ is the thrust\n*   $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate of exhaust gases\n*   $V_e$ is the exit velocity of the exhaust gases\n*   $P_e$ is the static pressure at the nozzle exit\n*   $P_a$ is the ambient (atmospheric) pressure\n*   $A_e$ is the nozzle exit area\n\nFor an optimally expanded nozzle, $P_e = P_a$. Therefore, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ becomes $0$.\n\nSo, the thrust equation simplifies to:\n$F = \\dot{m} V_e$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio $F / (\\dot{m} V_e)$. Substituting the simplified thrust equation:\n$F / (\\dot{m} V_e) = (\\dot{m} V_e) / (\\dot{m} V_e) = 1$\n\nThe velocity ratio $r = V_a / V_e = 2$ (where $V_a$ is vehicle velocity) is a distractor and is not required to solve this specific problem."
