        "reasoning": "The paragraph establishes a direct analogy: 'the prestige of a kingdom depended upon the number of taxes that it was able to levy on its people. It was very much like the prestige of a head-hunter in his own community.' This means that the factor determining the prestige of a kingdom (number of taxes) is analogous to the factor determining the prestige of a head-hunter. For a head-hunter, the equivalent of 'levying taxes' is 'gathering heads'. Therefore, the prestige of a head-hunter depended upon the number of heads he could gather. Option D directly reflects this analogy."
