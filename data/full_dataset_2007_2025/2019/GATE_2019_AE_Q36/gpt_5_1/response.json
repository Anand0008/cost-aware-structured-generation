At (1,1): \\(u = 3\\,\\text{m/s}\\), \\(v = -1\\,\\text{m/s}\\). 2) For steady, incompressible, constant-property 2D flow with no body forces, the x-momentum (Navier-Stokes) equation is \\n\\n\\(\\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right).\\)\\n\\n3) Compute derivatives of \\(u = 3 x y^2\\): \\(\\partial u/\\partial x = 3 y^2\\), \\(\\partial u/\\partial y = 6 x y\\), \\(\\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2 = 0\\), \\(\\partial^2 u/\\partial y^2 = 6 x\\). At (1,1): \\(\\partial u/\\partial x = 3\\), \\(\\partial u/\\partial y = 6\\), \\(\\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2 = 0\\), \\(\\partial^2 u/\\partial y^2 = 6\\). 4) Convective term at (1,1): \\(u\\,u_x + v\\,u_y = 3\\cdot 3 + (-1)\\cdot 6 = 9 - 6 = 3\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\). With \\(\\rho = 1\\,\\text{kg/m}^3\\), this gives \\(\\rho(\\dots) = 3\\,\\text{N/m}^3\\). 5) Viscous term: \\(\\mu(u_{xx} + u_{yy}) = 0.1\\,(0 + 6) = 0.6\\,\\text{N/m}^3\\). 6) Rearranging the momentum equation: \\(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -\\rho(u u_x + v u_y) + \\mu(u_{xx} + u_{yy}) = -3 + 0.6 = -2.4\\,\\text{N/m}^3\\). 7) The question asks for the magnitude, so \\(|\\partial p/\\partial x| = 2.4\\,\\text{N/m}^3\\). 8) The official key gives a range 2.3 to 2.5, which matches this result. The alternative range 3.5 to 3.7 likely corresponds to an incorrect omission or sign error in the viscous term; however, by definition the official key is accepted as correct, so both ranges are listed there. Physically and mathematically, 2.4 N/m^3 is the consistent value."
