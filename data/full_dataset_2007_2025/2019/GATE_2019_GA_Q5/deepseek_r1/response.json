          "Step 3: Evaluate each option grammatically and semantically:",
          "  - Option A: 'defeated' (Past Participle). Fits perfectly to form the passive voice: 'had never been defeated' (meaning: no one had defeated India).",
          "  - Option B: 'defeating' (Present Participle/Gerund). Would imply India was doing the action of defeating, which contradicts 'never been' and the context of Iran's arrival.",
          "  - Option C: 'defeat' (Base Form/Infinitive). Grammatically incorrect after 'been'; 'been defeat' is not a standard construction.",
          "  - Option D: 'defeatist' (Adjective). Means having a negative, resigned attitude. Does not fit the context of a win-loss record; 'been defeatist' would describe a mindset, not an outcome.",
          "Step 4: Select the only option that is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate: A. defeated."
