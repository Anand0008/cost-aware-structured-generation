The volume of a circular cone is given by the formula: $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\n\n2. When both the radius and height increase by 10%, the new radius becomes $r_2 = 1.1r_1$ and the new height becomes $h_2 = 1.1h_1$.\n\n3. Substituting the new values into the volume formula:\n$V_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (1.1r_1)^2 (1.1h_1) = 1.331 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r_1^2 h_1 = 1.331V_1$\n\n4. The percentage increase in volume is therefore:\n$\\frac{V_2 - V_1}{V_1} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1.331V_1 - V_1}{V_1} \\times 100\\% = 33.1\\%$\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in the cone's volume is 33.1%, which matches the correct answer C."
