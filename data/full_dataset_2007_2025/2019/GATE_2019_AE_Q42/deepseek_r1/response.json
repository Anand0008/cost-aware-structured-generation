To escape Earth's gravitational field, the minimum velocity increment is the difference between escape velocity and circular orbital velocity at that radius. Given Earth radius R_e = 6371 km = 6.371e6 m, altitude h = 4000 km = 4.0e6 m, so orbital radius r = R_e + h = 1.0371e7 m. Gravitational parameter μ = GM = 3.986e14 m³/s². Circular orbital velocity v_c = sqrt(μ/r) ≈ sqrt(3.986e14 / 1.0371e7) ≈ 6197.5 m/s = 6.1975 km/s. Escape velocity v_e = sqrt(2μ/r) ≈ v_c * sqrt(2) ≈ 6.1975 * 1.4142 ≈ 8.764 km/s. The increment Δv = v_e - v_c ≈ 8.764 - 6.1975 ≈ 2.567 km/s. Alternatively, Δv = v_c*(sqrt(2)-1) ≈ 6.1975 * 0.4142 ≈ 2.567 km/s.
