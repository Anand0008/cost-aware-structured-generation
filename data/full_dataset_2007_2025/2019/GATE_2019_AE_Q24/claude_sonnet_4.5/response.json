From the given stress state in the figure, the principal stresses are σ_1 = 200 MPa and σ_2 = 100 MPa. Using the stress transformation equation for normal stress on an inclined plane, σ_n = (σ_1 + σ_2)/2 + (σ_1 - σ_2)/2 * cos(2θ), where θ = 45 degrees, we get:\nσ_n = (200 + 100)/2 + (200 - 100)/2 * cos(2*45) = 150 + 50 * 0.707 = 247 MPa. Rounding this to the nearest integer gives the correct answer of 247 to 255 MPa."
