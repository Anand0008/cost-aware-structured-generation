    "question_text": "The static pressure ratio across a stationary normal shock is given by\np2/p1 = 1 + (2*gamma)/(gamma + 1) * (M1^2 - 1),\nwhere M1 is the upstream Mach number. For a stationary normal shock in air (gamma = 1.4, R = 287 J/kg-K) with upstream flow conditions given by: speed 800 m/s, static temperature 300 K and static pressure 1 atm., the static pressure downstream of the shock is __________ atm. (round off to 2 decimal places)."
