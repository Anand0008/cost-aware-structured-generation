Chunk 1 discusses moving shocks but includes the transformation technique and normal shock formulas, which are applicable. Chunks 3 and 5 give worked examples of stationary normal shock calculations using the same pressure ratio formula. The RAG context, however, did not explicitly cover the exact scenario of given velocity and temperature, but the principles and formulas are present. Therefore, RAG was helpful but not perfectly tailored."
