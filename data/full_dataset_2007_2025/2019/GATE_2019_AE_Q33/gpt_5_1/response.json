Thus \\(-\\frac{1}{y} = x - 2\\), so \\(y = -\\frac{1}{x - 2}\\). At \\(x = -2\\), \\(y(-2) = -\\frac{1}{-2 - 2} = -\\frac{1}{-4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\). Rounding to one decimal place gives 0.3. However, the official key states 0.5, which would correspond to solving \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = -y^2\\) or using a different initial condition.
