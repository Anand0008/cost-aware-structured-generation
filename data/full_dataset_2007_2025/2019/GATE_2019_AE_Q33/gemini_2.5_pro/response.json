          "Step 4: Use the given initial condition to find the value of the constant of integration, $C$. The curve passes through $(1, -1)$, which means when $x=1$, $y=-1$. Substitute these values into the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{(-1)} = 1 + C \\implies 1 = 1 + C \\implies C = 0$.",
          "Step 5: Write down the particular solution by substituting the value of $C$ back into the general solution. With $C=0$, the particular solution is $-\\frac{1}{y} = x$, which can be rearranged to $y = -\\frac{1}{x}$.",
