        "reasoning": "The problem describes a supersonic flow encountering a ramp, generating an incident oblique shock, which then reflects from a parallel top wall. We need to compare the deflection angles ($\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$) and shock angles ($\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$).\n\n1.  **Flow Deflection Angle ($\\theta$)**: For regular reflection of an oblique shock from a solid wall that is parallel to the initial flow direction, the flow must be turned back to be parallel to the wall after the reflected shock. This means the deflection angle caused by the reflected shock ($\\theta_2$) must be equal in magnitude to the deflection angle caused by the incident shock ($\\theta_1$). Thus, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Mach Number Change Across Shocks**: An oblique shock wave is a compression wave. When the flow passes through the incident oblique shock, its Mach number decreases. Therefore, the Mach number upstream of the reflected shock (let's call it $M_2$) will be less than the Mach number upstream of the incident shock ($M_1$). So, $M_2 < M_1$.\n\n3.  **Interpreting the $\\theta$-$\\beta$-$M$ Plot (Figure 2)**: The plot shows the relationship between the shock angle ($\\beta$), deflection angle ($\\theta$), and upstream Mach number ($M$). The curves are drawn for different Mach numbers, and the arrow indicates 'increasing M'. This implies that for a *given* deflection angle ($\\theta$), as the upstream Mach number ($M$) *decreases*, the corresponding shock angle ($\\beta$) *increases*. In other words, the curves for lower Mach numbers are located above and to the left of the curves for higher Mach numbers.\n\n4.  **Comparing Shock Angles ($\\beta_1$ vs $\\beta_2$)**: We have established that $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$ and $M_2 < M_1$. Since the upstream Mach number for the reflected shock ($M_2$) is lower than that for the incident shock ($M_1$), and both shocks cause the same magnitude of flow deflection ($\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$), the reflected shock angle ($\\beta_2$) must be greater than the incident shock angle ($\\beta_1$) according to the $\\theta$-$\\beta$-$M$ plot. Therefore, $\\beta_1 < \\beta_2$.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B is the correct choice."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Understand the physical setup.** The problem describes a supersonic flow at Mach number $M_1$ encountering a ramp with angle $\\theta_1$, which generates an incident oblique shock with angle $\\beta_1$. This shock then reflects from a parallel top wall, with the reflected shock having a turn angle $\\theta_2$ and shock angle $\\beta_2$.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze the flow deflection angles for regular reflection.** For regular reflection from a solid wall that is parallel to the initial flow direction, the fundamental principle is that the flow must be turned back to be parallel to the wall after passing through the reflected shock. This means the magnitude of the flow deflection caused by the reflected shock ($\\theta_2$) must be equal to the magnitude of the flow deflection caused by the incident shock ($\\theta_1$). Therefore, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$. This immediately eliminates options C ($\\theta_1 > \\theta_2$) and D ($\\theta_1 < \\theta_2$).",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the Mach number change across the incident shock.** An oblique shock wave is a compression phenomenon. When a supersonic flow passes through an oblique shock, its Mach number decreases. Thus, the Mach number downstream of the incident shock (let's call it $M_2$, which is the upstream Mach number for the reflected shock) will be less than the Mach number upstream of the incident shock ($M_1$). So, $M_2 < M_1$.",
          "**Step 4: Interpret the $\\theta$-$\\beta$-$M$ plot (Figure 2).** This plot shows the relationship between the shock angle ($\\beta$ on the y-axis), the flow deflection angle ($\\theta$ on the x-axis), and the upstream Mach number ($M$). The curves are for different Mach numbers, and the arrow indicates 'increasing M'. This means that for a *constant* flow deflection angle ($\\theta$), as the upstream Mach number ($M$) *decreases*, the corresponding shock angle ($\\beta$) *increases*. You can visualize this by moving vertically up from a fixed $\\theta$ value; the curves for lower $M$ are higher (larger $\\beta$).",
          "**Step 5: Compare the shock angles $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$.** We know from Step 2 that $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$. We also know from Step 3 that $M_2 < M_1$. Applying the interpretation from Step 4, since the upstream Mach number for the reflected shock ($M_2$) is lower than that for the incident shock ($M_1$), and the deflection angle is the same, the reflected shock angle ($\\beta_2$) must be greater than the incident shock angle ($\\beta_1$).",
          "**Step 6: Conclude the correct option.** Based on the comparison, $\\beta_1 < \\beta_2$. This corresponds to option B."
