        "reasoning": "In the first interaction, freestream Mach number is M1 and flow is turned by \\theta_1 through the incident oblique shock with angle \\beta_1. After this shock, the Mach number decreases to M2 < M1 but remains supersonic (weak solution). The reflected shock must turn the flow back by \\theta_2 = \\theta_1 so that it becomes parallel to the top wall (regular reflection condition). Thus the two shocks correspond to the same deflection angle but different upstream Mach numbers: M1 for the incident shock and M2 for the reflected shock. From the \\theta-\\beta-M relation (or the plotted family of curves in Figure 2), for a fixed deflection angle \\theta, the weak-shock solution has a *larger* shock angle \\beta when the upstream Mach number is *smaller*. Physically, a lower Mach number requires a stronger (more normal) shock to achieve the same turning. Therefore, with M2 < M1 and \\theta_2 = \\theta_1, we must have \\beta_2 > \\beta_1, i.e. \\beta_1 < \\beta_2. This matches option B. Options C and D are incorrect because the geometry of regular reflection demands \\theta_1 = \\theta_2 for a flat top wall, and option A contradicts the monotonic dependence of \\beta on M for fixed \\theta in the weak branch."

          "For regular reflection from a flat wall, the flow must be parallel to the wall both upstream of the incident shock and downstream of the reflected shock. Hence the net flow deflection must be zero, implying the reflected shock undoes the first turn: \\theta_2 = \\theta_1.",
          "Compare the upstream Mach numbers: the first shock sees M1, while the reflected shock sees M2, the Mach number behind the first shock. For a weak oblique shock, M2 is still supersonic but smaller than M1 (M2 < M1).",
          "Use the \\theta-\\beta-M relation or its plotted curves (Figure 2). For a fixed deflection angle \\theta and weak-shock branch, decreasing the upstream Mach number increases the shock angle \\beta (the curve for lower M lies above that for higher M).",
          "Apply this to the two shocks: both have the same \\theta, but the reflected shock has smaller upstream Mach number (M2). Therefore its shock angle must be larger: \\beta_2 > \\beta_1, or equivalently \\beta_1 < \\beta_2.",

The resulting oblique shock with shock angle beta1 is then reflected from the top wall. For the reflected shock, the turn angle is theta2 and the shock angle is beta2.\n\nUse the weak shock solution from the theta-beta-M plot shown in Figure 2 to choose the correct option from the following."
