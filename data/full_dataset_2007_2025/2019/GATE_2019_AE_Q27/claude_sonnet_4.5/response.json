The $\\theta-\\beta-M$ chart shows that for a fixed upstream Mach number ($M_1$) and flow deflection angle ($\\theta_1$), the reflected shock angle ($\\beta_2$) will be larger than the incident shock angle ($\\beta_1$). This is because the Mach number downstream of the incident shock ($M_2$) is lower than the upstream Mach number ($M_1$), which results in a steeper reflected shock wave.
