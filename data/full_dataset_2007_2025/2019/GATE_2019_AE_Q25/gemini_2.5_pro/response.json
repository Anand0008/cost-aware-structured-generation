        "reasoning": "The system shown in the figure consists of a mass `m` connected to three springs, each with stiffness `k`. The two springs on the left are connected in series between the left fixed wall and the mass. The third spring on the right is connected between the mass and the right fixed wall.\n\n1.  **Equivalent stiffness of springs in series:** The two springs on the left, each with stiffness `k`, are in series. Their equivalent stiffness, `k_series`, is given by:\n    `$\\frac{1}{k_{series}} = \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{2}{k}$`\n    `$k_{series} = \\frac{k}{2}$`\n\n2.  **Total equivalent stiffness:** Now, the mass `m` is effectively connected to `k_series` on its left and `k` (the third spring) on its right. When springs are connected on opposite sides of a mass and both resist its motion, they act in parallel. Therefore, the total equivalent stiffness, `k_eq`, is:\n    `$k_{eq} = k_{series} + k = \\frac{k}{2} + k = \\frac{3k}{2}$`\n\n3.  **Substitute given values:**\n    `$m = 3 \\text{ kg}$`\n    `$k = 20 \\text{ kN/m} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}$`\n    `$k_{eq} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times (20 \\times 10^3) = 30 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}$`\n\n4.  **Calculate natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    `$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eq}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}}{3 \\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ rad}^2/\\text{s}^2} = \\sqrt{10000} \\text{ rad/s} = 100 \\text{ rad/s}$`\n\n5.  **Calculate natural frequency (f_n) in Hz:**\n    `$f_n = \\frac{\\omega_n}{2\\pi} = \\frac{100 \\text{ rad/s}}{2\\pi \\text{ rad}} \\approx \\frac{100}{6.28318} \\text{ Hz} \\approx 15.915 \\text{ Hz}$`\n\n6.  **Round off to the nearest integer:**\n    `$f_n \\approx 16 \\text{ Hz}$`\n\nThis matches the provided correct answer range of 16 to 16."

While no chunk explicitly showed the exact spring combination of this problem, the principles of equivalent stiffness for series/parallel springs are foundational and covered implicitly by the SDOF context. Chunk 2 was particularly helpful in reminding about multi-spring systems and the determinant method, which reinforces the concept of equivalent stiffness for SDOF simplification."
