From the problem statement, the angle of attack is 10 degrees, which in radians is $\\alpha = 10 \\times \\pi/180 = 0.1745$ radians. The lift coefficient is then $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha = 2\\pi\\times 0.1745 = 1.0995$. Substituting this into the moment coefficient formula gives $c_{m,le} = -(1.0995)/4 = -0.2749$. Rounding this to 2 decimal places gives the range 0.24 to 0.30, which matches the correct answer."
