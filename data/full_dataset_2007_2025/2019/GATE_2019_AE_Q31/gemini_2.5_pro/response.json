        "reasoning": "To find the number of intersection points between `y = x` and `y = cos x`, we need to find the number of real solutions to the equation `x = cos x`. This can be reformulated as finding the roots of the function `f(x) = x - cos x`. We analyze the function's properties:\n1.  **Continuity**: `f(x) = x - cos x` is continuous for all real `x`, as both `x` and `cos x` are continuous functions.\n2.  **Existence of a root (Intermediate Value Theorem)**:\n    *   `f(0) = 0 - cos(0) = 0 - 1 = -1`\n    *   `f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 0 \\approx 1.57`\n    Since `f(0) < 0` and `f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) > 0`, and `f(x)` is continuous on `[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]`, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees at least one real root in the interval `(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}).`\n3.  **Uniqueness of the root (Monotonicity)**:\n    *   Find the first derivative of `f(x)`: `f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - cos x) = 1 - (-sin x) = 1 + sin x`.\n    *   For all real `x`, the range of `sin x` is `[-1, 1]`. Therefore, `1 + sin x` is always in the range `[0, 2]`. This means `f'(x) = 1 + sin x \\ge 0` for all real `x`.\n    *   A function whose derivative is always non-negative is monotonically non-decreasing. A monotonically non-decreasing function can cross the x-axis at most once. Even though `f'(x)` can be zero (when `sin x = -1`), it never becomes negative, meaning the function never decreases. Thus, it can only cross the x-axis once.\nCombining the existence and uniqueness arguments, there is exactly one real point of intersection."

          "Step 1: Formulate the problem as finding the roots of a single function `f(x) = 0` by setting the two given curves equal to each other. For `y = x` and `y = cos x`, this means solving `x = cos x`, or `f(x) = x - cos x = 0`.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the continuity of `f(x)`. Both `x` and `cos x` are continuous functions, so their difference `f(x)` is also continuous for all real `x`.",
          "Step 3: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to establish the existence of at least one root. Evaluate `f(x)` at two points where the function values have opposite signs. For example, `f(0) = -1` and `f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\approx 1.57`. Since `f(0) < 0` and `f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) > 0`, there must be at least one root between `0` and `\\frac{\\pi}{2}`.",
          "Step 4: Determine the monotonicity of `f(x)` by finding its first derivative, `f'(x)`. Calculate `f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - cos x) = 1 + sin x`.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the sign of `f'(x)`. Since `sin x` ranges from `-1` to `1`, `1 + sin x` ranges from `0` to `2`. Therefore, `f'(x) \\ge 0` for all real `x`. This indicates that `f(x)` is a monotonically non-decreasing function.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the number of intersection points. A continuous, monotonically non-decreasing function can cross the x-axis at most once. Since we established the existence of at least one root in Step 3, and uniqueness in Step 5, there is exactly one point of intersection."
