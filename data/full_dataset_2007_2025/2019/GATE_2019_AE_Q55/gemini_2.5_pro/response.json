This is achieved by formulating the mass matrix ([M]) and stiffness matrix ([K]) from the equations of motion, and then solving the eigenvalue problem `det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0`. For the given system, the mass matrix is `[M] = [[m, 0], [0, m]]` and the stiffness matrix is `[K] = [[3k, -2k], [-2k, 3k]]`. Solving the characteristic equation `(3k - m\\omega^2)^2 - (2k)^2 = 0` yields two natural frequencies: `\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{k/m}` and `\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5k/m}`. Substituting the given values `k = 1250 N/m` and `m = 10 kg` into the expression for the highest natural frequency `\\omega_2` gives `\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5 * 1250 / 10} = \\sqrt{625} = 25` radians/s.
