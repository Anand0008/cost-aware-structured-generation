Thus the stiffness matrix is K = [[3k, -2k],[-2k, 3k]] and mass matrix M = mI. Natural frequencies satisfy det(K - \\omega^2 M) = 0. This yields (3k - m\\omega^2)^2 - (2k)^2 = 0, so 3k - m\\omega^2 = \\pm 2k. Hence \\omega_1^2 = k/m and \\omega_2^2 = 5k/m. The highest natural frequency is \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5k/m}.
