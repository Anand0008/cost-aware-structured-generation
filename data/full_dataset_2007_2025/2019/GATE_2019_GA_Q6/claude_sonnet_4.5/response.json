Option B is incorrect because the passage indicates that the interest rates on small saving schemes were not maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates prior to the government's announcement. Option C is the correct inference, as it is supported by the information provided in the passage. Option D is incorrect because the passage does not state that a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follows only after a reduction in repo rate by the RBI."
