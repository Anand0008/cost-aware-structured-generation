        "reasoning": "The passage states: 'banking institutions have been making a demand to reduce interest rates on small saving schemes. Finally, the government announced yesterday a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes...' This sequence of events directly supports the inference that the government's decision to reduce interest rates was influenced by, or at least followed, the demands of banking institutions. Option C, 'The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions before reducing the interest rates on small saving schemes,' is a cautious and accurate inference because the passage describes one such instance, making 'sometimes' appropriate. \n\nLet's analyze why other options are incorrect:\n*   **A. Whenever the Reserve Bank of India reduces the repo rate, the interest rates on small saving schemes are also reduced.** This is too strong. The passage notes a one-year gap between the RBI's action and the government's action, and highlights the intervening demand from banks. It does not imply an automatic or immediate 'whenever' relationship.\n*   **B. Interest rates on small saving schemes are always maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates.** This is directly contradicted by the passage, which states the government reduced rates 'to bring them on par' with fixed deposit rates, implying they were *not* on par before.\n*   **D. A reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follow only after a reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India.** The word 'only' makes this statement too absolute. While a repo rate reduction preceded this event, the passage also emphasizes the banking institutions' demands as a factor. The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that this is the *sole* condition for such reductions."

          "Step 1: Read the entire passage carefully to grasp the sequence of events and the relationships between the entities mentioned (RBI, banking institutions, government).",
          "Step 2: Identify the key actions and their timing: RBI reduced repo rate (a year ago), banking institutions demanded rate reduction, government reduced small saving rates (yesterday) to bring them on par.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'Whenever the Reserve Bank of India reduces the repo rate, the interest rates on small saving schemes are also reduced.' The passage shows a one-year delay and an intervening demand, so 'whenever' is an overgeneralization and not directly supported.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: 'Interest rates on small saving schemes are always maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates.' The phrase 'to bring them on par' explicitly indicates they were *not* on par previously, making 'always maintained on par' false.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions before reducing the interest rates on small saving schemes.' The passage states that banking institutions made demands, and *finally* the government acted. This directly supports the idea that the government *did* consider these demands in this instance, and 'sometimes' is a valid, cautious inference.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: 'A reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follow only after a reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India.' The word 'only' makes this too restrictive. While a repo rate reduction occurred, the banking demands were also a factor, and the passage doesn't exclude other potential triggers. This cannot be inferred as the *sole* condition.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that Option C is the only statement that can be logically and accurately inferred from the given passage without making unsupported assumptions or generalizations."
