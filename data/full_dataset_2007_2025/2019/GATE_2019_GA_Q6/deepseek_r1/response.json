Option C ('The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions...') is the only statement that can be logically inferred without overreaching. Options A, B, and D use absolute terms like 'whenever,' 'always,' and 'only,' which the passage's single sequence of events does not support. The correct inference is that the government's action followed the banks' demand, implying consideration, but not a guaranteed or exclusive causal relationship."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Read the passage carefully and extract the sequence of events and stated facts. Event 1: RBI reduced the repo rate by 125 basis points over the last year. Event 2: Banking institutions have been demanding a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes. Event 3: The government has now reduced those rates to bring them on par with fixed deposit rates.",
          "Step 2: Understand the question: It asks which statement can be *inferred* from the passage. An inference must be directly supported by the information given, not an assumption or an absolute generalization.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A (\"Whenever the RBI reduces the repo rate, small saving scheme rates are also reduced\"). The passage describes only one instance. No support for a universal \"whenever\" rule exists. This is an over-generalization.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B (\"Interest rates on small saving schemes are always maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates\"). The passage says the government's recent action was to bring them \"on par.\" The word \"always\" is not supported; this may be a one-time adjustment.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C (\"The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions...\"). The passage explicitly states that banks made a demand and then the government acted. This temporal sequence and the context strongly imply that the demand was considered. The cautious wording \"sometimes\" aligns with the single example provided.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D (\"A reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follow only after a reduction in repo rate\"). The word \"only\" makes this statement too strong. The passage does not rule out other triggers for a reduction; it only describes this specific sequence.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that Option C is the only statement that can be reasonably and directly inferred from the passage without introducing unsupported assumptions or absolute language."
