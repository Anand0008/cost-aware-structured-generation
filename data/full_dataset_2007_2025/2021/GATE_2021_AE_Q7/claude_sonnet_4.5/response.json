This is due to the competing effects of thermal efficiency and propulsive efficiency.\n\nAt low pressure ratios, the thermal efficiency increases with pressure ratio, leading to higher overall efficiency. However, as the pressure ratio increases further, the exhaust velocity increases, causing the propulsive efficiency to decrease. This results in the overall propulsion efficiency first decreasing and then increasing with pressure ratio, exhibiting an optimal point. The RAG context provided clear explanations and formulas supporting this trend, which matches the correct answer D."
