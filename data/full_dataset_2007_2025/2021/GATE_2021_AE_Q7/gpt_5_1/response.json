        "reasoning": "For a turbofan at fixed flight Mach number and altitude, increasing compressor pressure ratio \\(\\pi_c\\) increases the core exhaust velocity and changes the balance between core and bypass streams. From parametric analyses of turbojet/turbofan engines, propulsive efficiency \\(\\eta_p\\) does not vary monotonically with \\(\\pi_c\\). At low \\(\\pi_c\\), the jet velocity is not much higher than flight speed, so \\(\\eta_p\\) is relatively high. As \\(\\pi_c\\) increases, the exhaust velocity rises faster than the flight speed, so more kinetic energy is wasted in the jet and \\(\\eta_p\\) initially decreases. Beyond some optimum, further increase in \\(\\pi_c\\) can improve matching between effective jet velocity (considering both core and bypass streams, pressure effects, and real losses) and flight velocity, causing \\(\\eta_p\\) to increase again or at least recover, giving a characteristic 'dip then rise' behavior. RAG chunks for turbojet/turbofan parametric analysis (Chunks 3, 4, 5) explicitly mention that propulsive efficiency vs compressor pressure ratio shows an optimum rather than a monotonic trend. Among the given options, 'first decreases and then increases' best represents this non-monotonic behavior."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall that propulsive efficiency \\(\\eta_p\\) measures how effectively the engine converts jet power into useful thrust power. For a simple jet, \\(\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_0}{V_9 + V_0}\\), where \\(V_0\\) is flight speed and \\(V_9\\) is effective jet speed.",
          "Step 2: At fixed Mach number and altitude, \\(V_0\\) is fixed. Increasing compressor pressure ratio \\(\\pi_c\\) increases the total temperature and pressure available for expansion in the turbine and nozzle, tending to increase the core jet velocity.",
          "Step 3: As \\(\\pi_c\\) increases from low values, \\(V_9\\) rises above \\(V_0\\). The larger the difference \\(V_9 - V_0\\), the more kinetic energy is wasted in the exhaust, so propulsive efficiency tends to decrease.",
          "Step 4: In a turbofan, the bypass stream (low-speed jet) and real losses complicate this picture. With further increase in \\(\\pi_c\\), changes in turbine work split, fan operation, and nozzle pressure ratios can lead to a regime where the effective jet velocity (combined core + bypass) moves closer again to \\(V_0\\), improving \\(\\eta_p\\).",
          "Step 5: Parametric studies (as in Hill & Peterson, Ganesan, and the RAG video notes) show that propulsive efficiency vs compressor pressure ratio exhibits a non-monotonic curve with an optimum, not a simple always-increasing or always-decreasing trend.",
          "Step 6: Therefore, the best qualitative description among the options is that propulsive efficiency first decreases and then increases with increasing compressor pressure ratio."

These explicitly discussed how propulsive, thermal, and overall efficiencies vary with compressor pressure ratio and mentioned the presence of optima and non-monotonic behavior. This was directly relevant to answering the question qualitatively. No exact statement of 'first decreases then increases' was given, but the non-monotonic nature and optima were clear, and internal knowledge filled the remaining reasoning."
