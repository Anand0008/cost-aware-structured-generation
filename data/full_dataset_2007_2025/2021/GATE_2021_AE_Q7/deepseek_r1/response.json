        "reasoning": "The answer key states D, and the RAG context supports a non-monotonic trend. For a turbojet (Chunk 3), propulsive efficiency (η_p) shows a peak with compressor pressure ratio (π_c). For a turbofan (Chunk 5), η_p generally increases with π_c then slightly decreases or plateaus. This indicates an optimum point. However, the specific thrust (F_s) vs. π_c relationship is critical (Chunk 2 & 4): F_s first increases, reaches a maximum, then decreases. Since propulsion efficiency is strongly tied to exhaust velocity (V_e), which follows a similar non-monotonic trend due to the trade-off between pressure thrust and momentum thrust, η_p will first decrease as V_e increases, then increase as V_e decreases after the peak. Thus, the trend is first decreases then increases, matching option D."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the key terms. Propulsion efficiency (η_p) for an air-breathing engine is defined as the ratio of thrust power to the rate of addition of kinetic energy to the exhaust stream. For an ideal jet, η_p = 2 / (1 + V_e/V_0), where V_e is exhaust velocity and V_0 is flight speed.",
          "Step 2: Recognize the effect of compressor pressure ratio (π_c). Increasing π_c increases the compressor discharge temperature and pressure. For a fixed Turbine Inlet Temperature (T_t4), this reduces the temperature rise across the combustor, lowering fuel flow (improving thermal efficiency). However, the impact on exhaust velocity V_e is non-monotonic.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the specific thrust trend. From parametric studies (Chunks 2 & 4), specific thrust (F_s) vs. π_c initially increases due to higher expansion potential (pressure thrust), reaches a maximum, and then decreases because the increased compressor work consumes more energy, leaving less for accelerating the jet (lower V_e).",
          "Step 4: Relate exhaust velocity to propulsion efficiency. As π_c increases from a low value, V_e initially increases (causing V_e/V_0 to increase), which decreases η_p (since η_p ∝ 1/(1+V_e/V_0)). After the peak specific thrust point, further increase in π_c causes V_e to decrease, leading to an increase in η_p.",
          "Step 5: Synthesize the trend. Therefore, propulsion efficiency (η_p) first decreases and then increases with increasing compressor pressure ratio, exhibiting a minimum (not a maximum) because η_p is inversely related to V_e for a fixed V_0. This matches the typical trade-off curves observed in real cycle analysis."

        "notes": "RAG provided multiple chunks (1-5) on parametric analysis of turbojet and turbofan engines, discussing trends of specific thrust, TSFC, and efficiencies with compressor pressure ratio. However, no chunk explicitly stated 'propulsion efficiency first decreases then increases' for a turbofan. Chunk 5 mentioned η_p generally increases then slightly decreases, which is opposite to the correct answer. Chunks 2,3,4 provided the crucial insight that specific thrust peaks, leading to the inverse relationship for η_p. Thus, RAG was helpful but required synthesis and interpretation to arrive at the correct trend."
