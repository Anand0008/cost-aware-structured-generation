Chunk 4 and 5 contained a worked example with a formula for $C_{M,cg}$ that, if directly differentiated, could lead to an incorrect $C_{m_{\\alpha}}$ due to an ambiguous 'a' term. However, the components needed for the correct derivation were present across the RAG context, allowing for accurate problem-solving."
