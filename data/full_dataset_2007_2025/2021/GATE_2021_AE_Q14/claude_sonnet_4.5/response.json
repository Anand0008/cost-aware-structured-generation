Total pressure decreases: Across any shock wave, there is an irreversible increase in entropy, which manifests as a decrease in the total (stagnation) pressure. The stagnation pressure ratio `P02/P01` can be calculated using the normal component of the upstream Mach number, `M_n1 = M1 * sin(β)`, and the normal shock relations.\n\nB. Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock decreases: The tangential component of velocity, `w`, remains constant across the oblique shock. However, the total velocity `V` decreases, so the Mach number based on the tangential velocity component, `M_t = w/a`, must also decrease.\n\nC. Total temperature remains constant: For an adiabatic shock, the total (stagnation) temperature `T0` is conserved across the shock, as the tangential velocity component does not contribute to the change in total enthalpy."
