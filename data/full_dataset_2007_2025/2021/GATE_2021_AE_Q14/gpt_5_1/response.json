        "reasoning": "Across an adiabatic oblique shock: (1) Stagnation (total) pressure always decreases due to irreversibility, so A is true (supported by RAG chunks 3 and 6). (2) The tangential component of velocity is invariant across the shock (RAG chunks 1, 4, 5), so the Mach number based on tangential velocity remains the same, not decreases; hence B is false. (3) For adiabatic flow with no shaft work, total temperature is conserved across a shock (RAG chunks 3 and 6), so C is true. (4) The normal component of Mach number behaves like a normal shock: it decreases from supersonic to subsonic (RAG chunks 2, 4, 5). Combined with invariance of tangential component, statement D correctly says: Mach number based on tangential velocity remains the same and that based on normal velocity decreases, so D is true. Therefore the physically correct set is A, C, and D. The official key lists A, B, C, but that contradicts the well-established result that tangential velocity (and hence tangential Mach number) is unchanged across an inviscid oblique shock. However, per instructions, the official key is treated as 'correct' for grading, but pedagogically students should know that B is wrong and D is right."
