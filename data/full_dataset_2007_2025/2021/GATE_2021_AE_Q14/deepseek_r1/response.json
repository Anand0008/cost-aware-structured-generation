A: Total pressure (stagnation pressure) always decreases across any shock due to irreversibility (entropy increase). B: The Mach number based on the tangential velocity decreases because the tangential velocity component (V_t) remains constant, but the speed of sound (a = sqrt(\\gamma R T)) increases due to temperature rise across the shock, so M_t = V_t / a decreases. C: Total temperature (stagnation temperature) remains constant across an adiabatic shock as total enthalpy is conserved. D: The first part of statement D is false (tangential Mach number does not remain the same, it decreases), making the entire statement false."

          "Step 3: Analyze each statement using these principles.\n   - A. Total pressure decreases: True. Shock waves are irreversible processes, leading to entropy increase and a drop in stagnation pressure (P_0). This holds for both normal and oblique shocks.\n   - B. Tangential Mach number decreases: True. The tangential velocity component (w) is invariant across the shock (w1 = w2). However, static temperature increases (T2 > T1), increasing the speed of sound (a2 > a1). Therefore, the tangential Mach number M_t = w/a decreases.\n   - C. Total temperature remains constant: True. For adiabatic flow with no work or heat transfer, total enthalpy (h0) is constant. For a perfect gas, this implies constant stagnation temperature (T_0).\n   - D. Compound statement: The first part (tangential Mach remains same) is false as explained, so the entire statement is false.",

        "notes": "RAG context provided excellent coverage of oblique shock fundamentals, including tangential velocity invariance, property changes based on normal Mach number, and stagnation property behavior. However, one chunk (Chunk 2) contained a potential inaccuracy stating 'tangential component of ... Mach number remains constant', which is incorrect. This highlights the need for critical evaluation of sources. Overall, RAG was highly relevant and sufficient."
