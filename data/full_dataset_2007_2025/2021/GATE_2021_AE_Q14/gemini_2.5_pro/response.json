        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify true statement(s) across an oblique shock under adiabatic conditions. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Statement A: Total pressure decreases.** Across any shock wave (normal or oblique), the flow undergoes an irreversible process. This irreversibility leads to an increase in entropy, which is always accompanied by a decrease in total (stagnation) pressure ($P_{02} < P_{01}$). This is a fundamental principle of compressible flow with shocks. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 2, 3, 6).\n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n2.  **Statement B: Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock decreases.** The tangential component of *velocity* ($V_t$) is conserved across an oblique shock ($V_{t1} = V_{t2}$). However, the static temperature ($T$) of the flow increases across the shock ($T_2 > T_1$). Since the speed of sound is given by $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, an increase in $T$ means an increase in $a$ ($a_2 > a_1$). The tangential Mach number is defined as $M_t = V_t / a$. As $V_t$ is constant and $a$ increases, $M_t$ must decrease ($M_{t2} < M_{t1}$). (RAG Chunks 2, 4, 5 confirm $V_t$ is constant; RAG Chunks 2, 3 confirm $T$ increases).\n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n3.  **Statement C: Total temperature remains constant.** For an adiabatic flow (no heat addition or removal), the total (stagnation) enthalpy remains constant across the shock. Since total temperature is directly related to total enthalpy ($h_0 = C_p T_0$), the total temperature also remains constant across an adiabatic oblique shock. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 2, 3, 5, 6).\n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n4.  **Statement D: Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock remains the same and that based on velocity normal to the shock decreases.**\n    *   The first part, \"Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock remains the same,\" is **FALSE**, as explained for statement B (it decreases).\n    *   The second part, \"that based on velocity normal to the shock decreases,\" is **TRUE**, as the normal component of Mach number changes from supersonic ($M_{n1} > 1$) to subsonic ($M_{n2} < 1$) across the shock. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 2, 4).\n    Since the first part of the statement is false, the entire statement D is considered **FALSE**.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A, B, and C are true, which matches the provided answer key."

          "**Step 1: Understand Oblique Shock Fundamentals.** Recall the basic properties of flow across an oblique shock wave, specifically how velocity components and thermodynamic properties change. An oblique shock is an irreversible process occurring in adiabatic conditions.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze Tangential Velocity and Mach Number.** Recognize that the tangential component of *velocity* ($V_t$) is conserved across an oblique shock ($V_{t1} = V_{t2}$). However, the static temperature ($T$) increases across the shock ($T_2 > T_1$). Since the speed of sound ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$) is proportional to $\\sqrt{T}$, an increase in $T$ means an increase in $a$ ($a_2 > a_1$). The tangential Mach number is defined as $M_t = V_t / a$. With $V_t$ constant and $a$ increasing, $M_t$ must decrease. This makes statement B TRUE and the first part of statement D FALSE.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze Normal Velocity and Mach Number.** The normal component of Mach number ($M_n$) transitions from supersonic ($M_{n1} > 1$) to subsonic ($M_{n2} < 1$) across the shock, similar to a normal shock. Thus, $M_n$ decreases. This makes the second part of statement D TRUE.",
          "**Step 4: Analyze Total Pressure.** Understand that any shock wave is an irreversible process, leading to an increase in entropy. This increase in entropy is always accompanied by a decrease in total (stagnation) pressure ($P_{02} < P_{01}$). This makes statement A TRUE.",
          "**Step 5: Analyze Total Temperature.** For adiabatic conditions (no heat transfer), the total (stagnation) enthalpy remains constant across the shock. Since total temperature is directly related to total enthalpy ($h_0 = C_p T_0$), the total temperature also remains constant across an adiabatic oblique shock ($T_{02} = T_{01}$). This makes statement C TRUE.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent coverage of oblique shock fundamentals, including conservation of tangential velocity, total temperature, and decrease in total pressure. There was a slight ambiguity in CHUNK 1's statement 'M_t is invariant' which could lead to confusion if not cross-referenced with the more precise 'V_t is invariant' from other chunks and standard textbook knowledge. This required careful re-evaluation to align with the provided answer key and correct physical understanding. The rest of the RAG was very helpful and directly supported the analysis."
