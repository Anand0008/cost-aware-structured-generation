        "reasoning": "The question asks for the speed at which a jet aircraft achieves maximum endurance in steady, level flight. For a jet aircraft, maximum endurance is achieved when the aircraft flies at the velocity corresponding to the maximum lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) or $C_L/C_D$. The drag polar is given by $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$. To find the $C_L$ for maximum $L/D$, we differentiate $C_L/C_D$ with respect to $C_L$ and set it to zero, or recognize that this condition occurs when $C_{D_0} = K C_L^2$. This yields $C_L = \\sqrt{C_{D_0}/K}$.\n\nGiven:\n$C_D = 0.02 + 0.04 C_L^2 \\implies C_{D_0} = 0.02, K = 0.04$\nWing loading $W/S = 1800 \\text{ N/m}^2$\nDensity of air $\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n\n1.  **Calculate $C_L$ for maximum endurance:**\n    $C_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{D_0}}{K}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{0.04}} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.7071$\n    This value ($0.7071$) is less than $C_{L,max} = 1.6$, so it is achievable.\n\n2.  **Calculate the speed $V$ using the lift equation:**\n    For steady, level flight, Lift = Weight ($L=W$).\n    $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$\n    Dividing by wing area $S$:\n    $\\frac{W}{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_L$\n    Rearranging for $V$:\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (W/S)}{\\rho C_L}}$\n    Substitute the values:\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1800 \\text{ N/m}^2}{1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.7071}}$\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{3600}{0.8662975}} = \\sqrt{4155.51} \\approx 64.463 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the speed is $64.46 \\text{ m/s}$.
