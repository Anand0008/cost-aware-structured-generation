        "reasoning": "Based on Archimedes' principle and conservation of mass: For pure ice (P), melted water volume equals initially displaced water volume, so level remains same. For ice with embedded steel ball (Q), the steel is denser than water; after melting, the combined volume of melted water and submerged steel is less than the initial displaced volume, so level decreases. For ice with an air bubble (R), the air bubble has negligible mass but finite volume; after melting, if the air bubble escapes, the added water volume is less than the initial displaced volume (which included displacement due to the air bubble's weight), so level decreases."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the principle - For a floating object, weight of object = weight of displaced fluid (Archimedes' principle). After melting, compare the volume of water added (from melted ice plus any submerged object) with the initial displaced volume to determine level change.",
          "Step 2: Analyze case P (pure ice cube). Let mass of ice = m_i, density of water = \\rho_w. Initial displaced volume V_sub = m_i / \\rho_w. After melting, ice turns into water of volume V_water = m_i / \\rho_w. Since V_water = V_sub, water level remains same.",
          "Step 3: Analyze case Q (ice cube with steel ball). Let mass of ice = m_i, mass of steel = m_s, density of steel = \\rho_s > \\rho_w. Initial displaced volume V_sub = (m_i + m_s) / \\rho_w. After melting: water volume from ice = m_i / \\rho_w; steel ball sinks and occupies volume V_s = m_s / \\rho_s. Total final volume occupying space in water = m_i/\\rho_w + m_s/\\rho_s. Compare with V_sub: V_sub - (m_i/\\rho_w + m_s/\\rho_s) = m_s(1/\\rho_w - 1/\\rho_s) > 0 since \\rho_s > \\rho_w. So initial displaced volume is larger, hence water level decreases.",
          "Step 4: Analyze case R (ice cube with air bubble). Let mass of ice = m_i, mass of air bubble = m_a (negligible but finite), volume of air bubble = V_a. Initial displaced volume V_sub = (m_i + m_a) / \\rho_w ≈ m_i/\\rho_w (but slightly more due to m_a). After melting: ice turns into water volume = m_i/\\rho_w; the air bubble is released. If the air bubble escapes to atmosphere, it no longer displaces water. So final added volume is only m_i/\\rho_w, which is less than V_sub (since V_sub included m_a/\\rho_w). Therefore, water level decreases. (If air bubble remains trapped as a floating bubble, it would displace water equal to its weight, and level would remain same; but typically in such problems, escape is assumed leading to decrease.)"
