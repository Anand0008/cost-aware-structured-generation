        "reasoning": "Glass P: A floating pure ice cube displaces water whose weight equals its own. When it melts, it becomes exactly that displaced water volume (since density of ice is less than water but mass is conserved). Therefore water level remains unchanged.\nGlass Q: Ice cube contains a dense steel ball but the whole composite still floats (as shown). While floating, it displaces water whose weight equals the combined weight of ice + steel. After melting, the steel ball sinks to the bottom and only displaces water equal to its own volume (since submerged solid displaces volume, not weight). Because steel density is much greater than water, the volume of water displaced by the sunken ball is less than the volume of water that had been displaced due to its weight while floating. Hence the total displaced volume decreases and the water level falls.\nGlass R: Ice cube contains a trapped air bubble. While floating, the composite displaces water whose weight equals ice + air. Air has negligible weight but finite volume. After melting, the air bubble escapes to the atmosphere and no longer displaces water. The melted ice alone now displaces water equal to its own volume, which is the same as in glass P. Initially, however, the floating ice with bubble had to displace slightly more water (because it had to support the small weight of the air plus the reduced average density made the cube larger for the same ice mass). Once the bubble leaves, the displaced volume reduces to that corresponding only to the melted water, so the water level decreases. Thus levels: P same, Q decreases, R decreases."

          "Case Q (ice + steel ball): While floating, the composite displaces water whose weight equals (mass of ice + mass of steel) times g. After melting, the steel ball sinks and displaces water equal only to its own (small) volume, not its weight. Since steel density is much larger than water, this displaced volume is less than what was previously required to balance its weight. The melted ice contributes the same volume as before, so total displaced volume decreases and water level drops.",
          "Case R (ice + air bubble): The composite still floats, displacing water equal to weight of ice + air. Air has negligible weight but occupies volume inside the ice, making the average density of the cube lower and thus requiring a larger displaced volume to balance its (almost same as ice) weight. After melting, the air escapes and no longer displaces water; only the melted ice (now water) remains, which occupies the same volume as in case P. Therefore the displaced volume is less than before and the water level decreases.",
