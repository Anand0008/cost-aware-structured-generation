        "reasoning": "The problem requires ensuring dynamic similarity by matching inertial and viscous forces, which translates to matching the Reynolds number (Re) between the prototype (aircraft) and the model (wind tunnel). The Reynolds number is given by $Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}$.\n\nGiven conditions:\n1.  Prototype velocity, $V_p = 100$ km/h\n2.  Scale model, $L_m = \\frac{L_p}{5}$\n3.  Wind tunnel pressure, $p_m = 10 \\times p_p$\n4.  Same temperature, $T_m = T_p$\n5.  Ideal gas law holds: $p = \\rho R T \\implies \\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$\n6.  Matching inertial and viscous forces implies $Re_p = Re_m$.\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Reynolds Number Similarity:**\n    $\\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m}$\n\n2.  **Viscosity relationship:** For ideal gases, viscosity ($\\mu$) is primarily a function of temperature. Since $T_m = T_p$, it implies that the viscosity of the fluid in the model test is the same as in the prototype flight, i.e., $\\mu_m = \\mu_p$. (This is a crucial simplification. If temperatures were different, a relation like $\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}$ would be needed, as seen in RAG chunks 1 & 4).\n    Therefore, the Reynolds number similarity simplifies to:\n    $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$\n\n3.  **Density ratio from Ideal Gas Law:**\n    Since $p = \\rho R T$, the density $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$.\n    The ratio of densities is $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m / (R T_m)}{p_p / (R T_p)}$.\n    Given $T_m = T_p$ and assuming the same gas (or at least the same gas constant $R$), the $R$ and $T$ terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m}{p_p}$\n    Substitute $p_m = 10 \\times p_p$:\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{10 \\times p_p}{p_p} = 10$\n    So, $\\rho_m = 10 \\times \\rho_p$.\n\n4.  **Substitute ratios into simplified Reynolds number equation:**\n    $\\rho_p V_p L_p = (10 \\rho_p) V_m (\\frac{L_p}{5})$\n    Cancel out $\\rho_p$ and $L_p$ from both sides:\n    $V_p = 10 \\times V_m \\times \\frac{1}{5}$\n    $V_p = 2 \\times V_m$\n\n5.  **Solve for $V_m$:**\n    $V_m = \\frac{V_p}{2}$\n    $V_m = \\frac{100 \\text{ km/h}}{2} = 50 \\text{ km/h}$\n\nThus, the velocity needed in the wind tunnel test-section is 50 km/h, which corresponds to option B."

          "Step 1: Understand the principle of dynamic similarity. The problem states 'similarity of inertial and viscous forces', which directly implies that the Reynolds number ($Re$) must be matched between the prototype (aircraft) and the model (wind tunnel).",
          "Step 2: Write down the Reynolds number formula for both prototype and model: $Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}$. Equate them: $\\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m}$.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the given conditions for viscosity. The problem states 'same temperature conditions in model and prototype' ($T_m = T_p$). For ideal gases, viscosity ($\\mu$) is primarily a function of temperature. Therefore, if temperatures are the same, viscosities are also the same: $\\mu_m = \\mu_p$. This allows us to cancel $\\mu$ from both sides of the Reynolds number equation, simplifying it to $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$.",
          "Step 4: Determine the density ratio using the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is $p = \\rho R T$, which can be rearranged to $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$. Form the ratio of model density to prototype density: $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m / (R T_m)}{p_p / (R T_p)}$. Since $T_m = T_p$ and $R$ is the gas constant (assumed same for the gas used), this simplifies to $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m}{p_p}$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the given pressure ratio into the density ratio. We are given $p_m = 10 \\times p_p$. So, $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{10 p_p}{p_p} = 10$. This means the density in the wind tunnel is 10 times the density in flight.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the density ratio and length ratio into the simplified Reynolds number equation. We have $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$. Rearrange to solve for $V_m$: $V_m = V_p \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right)$. Substitute $\\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} = \\frac{1}{10}$ and $\\frac{L_p}{L_m} = 5$ (since $L_m = L_p/5$).",
          "Step 7: Calculate the final velocity. $V_m = 100 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{10} \\right) \\times 5 = 100 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{5}{10} = 100 \\text{ km/h} \\times 0.5 = 50 \\text{ km/h}$."

They provided definitions of dynamic similarity, Reynolds number, ideal gas law, and worked examples demonstrating the application of these principles in wind tunnel testing. Specifically, the worked examples in chunks 1, 2, and 4 showed how to match Reynolds numbers and use the ideal gas law for density, which was directly applicable to this problem. The only minor difference was the temperature condition (constant T in question vs. varying T in RAG example), but the principle of viscosity dependence on temperature was covered."
