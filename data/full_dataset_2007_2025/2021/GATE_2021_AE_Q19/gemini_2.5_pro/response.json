For a critically damped system, the damping ratio ($\\zeta$) is equal to 1, which means the actual damping coefficient (c) is equal to the critical damping coefficient (c_c). The formula for critical damping coefficient is $c_c = 2m\\omega_n$. Given the mass $m = 10$ kg and the natural frequency $\\omega_n = 13.2$ rad/s, we can calculate $c = c_c = 2 \\times 10 \\times 13.2 = 264$ Ns/m. It is important to note that the given spring stiffness $k = 17400$ N/m is inconsistent with the given mass and natural frequency ($ \\sqrt{k/m} = \\sqrt{17400/10} = \\sqrt{1740} \\approx 41.71$ rad/s $\\neq 13.2$ rad/s).
