        "reasoning": "The solution is derived by applying the principles of velocity triangles for an axial compressor rotor. We assume constant axial velocity ($V_f$) through the stage. First, the axial component of the relative velocity at the rotor exit is calculated using the given relative velocity magnitude ($W_2 = 140 \\text{ m/s}$) and the relative flow angle ($\beta_2 = 30^\\circ$). This calculated $V_f$ is then used with the given absolute velocity magnitude ($V_2 = 240 \\text{ m/s}$) to find the tangential component of the absolute velocity ($V_{w2}$) using the Pythagorean theorem. Similarly, the tangential component of the relative velocity ($W_{w2}$) is found using $W_2$ and $\beta_2$. Finally, based on the provided velocity triangle diagram, which clearly shows the tangential components of $W_2$ and $V_2$ on opposite sides of the axial line, the blade speed ($U$) is determined as the sum of the magnitudes of these two tangential components ($U = V_{w2} + W_{w2}$). All calculations are straightforward applications of trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem. The calculated value of $277.12 \\text{ m/s}$ falls within the specified GATE answer range of 274 to 282."
