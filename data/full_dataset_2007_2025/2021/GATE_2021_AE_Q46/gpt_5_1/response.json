The absolute velocities at the rotor inlet and exit are equal to 140 m/s and 240 m/s, respectively. The flow velocities relative to the rotor at inlet and exit of the rotor are equal to 240 m/s and 140 m/s, respectively. The blade speed (U) at the mean radius of the rotor is __________ m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
