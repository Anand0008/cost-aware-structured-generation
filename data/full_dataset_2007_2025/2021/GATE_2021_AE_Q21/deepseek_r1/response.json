        "reasoning": "A free vortex (irrotational vortex) has circulation Γ = 2πK for any closed loop that encloses the vortex, and Γ = 0 for any loop that does not enclose it. The vortex filament is at the origin (0,0). The loop ABCDEFA, as defined by the coordinates A(1,0), B(2,0), C(2,-2), D(0,-2), E(0,-1), F(1,-1) in that order, does NOT enclose the origin. This can be verified by ray-casting or noting the loop lies entirely in the region x≥0, y≤0 with the origin on its boundary but not inside. Since the flow is irrotational everywhere except at the origin, by Stokes' theorem, circulation around a loop not enclosing the singularity is zero. The strength K = 5 m²/s is irrelevant for non-enclosing loops."

          "Step 2: Recall the property of circulation. For an irrotational vortex, circulation Γ around a closed loop is zero if the loop does not enclose the vortex, and Γ = ±2πK (sign depends on direction) if it encloses the vortex.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the given loop ABCDEFA using the provided coordinates. The vertices in order: A(1,0)→B(2,0)→C(2,-2)→D(0,-2)→E(0,-1)→F(1,-1)→A(1,0). Plot or reason geometrically: the loop lies in the fourth quadrant and first quadrant negative y, with all x ≥ 0, y ≤ 0. The origin (0,0) is not inside the loop (e.g., using ray-casting with a slight upward ray yields zero intersections).",
          "Step 4: Apply Stokes' theorem. Since the loop does not enclose the origin, the entire area bounded by the loop is in a region where vorticity ∇ × V = 0. Thus, Γ = ∮ V·ds = ∬ (∇ × V)·dS = 0.",
