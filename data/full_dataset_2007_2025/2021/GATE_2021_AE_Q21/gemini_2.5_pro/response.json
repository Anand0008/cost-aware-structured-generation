The definition of circulation `$\\Gamma$` around a closed curve `C` is given by the line integral of the velocity vector `$\\mathbf{V}$` along the curve: `$\\Gamma = \\oint_C \\mathbf{V} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$`. \\n\\nAccording to Stokes' Theorem, this line integral can be transformed into a surface integral of the vorticity vector `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V})$` over any open surface `S` bounded by the curve `C`: `$\\Gamma = \\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$`. \\n\\nFor a free vortex, the flow is irrotational everywhere except at its core (the origin, `r=0`), where the vorticity is infinite (a singularity). This means that `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = 0$` for all points where `r > 0`. \\n\\nBy examining the provided figure and the coordinates of the loop ABCDEFA (A(1,0), B(2,0), C(2,-2), D(0,-2), E(0,-1), F(1,-1)), it is clear that the origin (0,0) is located *outside* the area enclosed by this closed loop. Since the loop does not enclose the singularity (the vortex core at the origin), the entire region `S` bounded by the loop `C` consists of irrotational flow where `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = 0$`. \\n\\nTherefore, the surface integral of vorticity over `S` is zero: `$\\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\iint_S 0 \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0$`. \\n\\nConsequently, the circulation around the closed loop ABCDEFA is 0 m²/s. The strength K = 5 m²/s is relevant if the loop enclosed the vortex, but in this case, it acts as a distractor."

          "Step 2: Recall the definition of circulation and Stokes' Theorem. Circulation `$\\Gamma$` around a closed curve `C` is `$\\oint_C \\mathbf{V} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$`. Stokes' Theorem states that `$\\Gamma = \\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$`, where `S` is any surface bounded by `C`.",
          "Step 3: Understand the properties of a free vortex. A free vortex is characterized by irrotational flow everywhere except at its core (the origin, `r=0`), where the vorticity `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V})$` is infinite (a singularity). Thus, `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = 0$` for `r > 0`.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the geometry of the closed loop ABCDEFA. Carefully examine the provided image and the coordinates of the points (A(1,0), B(2,0), C(2,-2), D(0,-2), E(0,-1), F(1,-1)). Determine if the origin (0,0), where the vortex filament is located, lies inside or outside the area enclosed by this loop.",
          "Step 5: Conclude based on enclosure. Visual inspection and coordinate analysis confirm that the origin (0,0) is outside the closed loop ABCDEFA. The loop starts at x=1, y=0 and extends into the first and fourth quadrants, but never encloses the origin.",
          "Step 6: Apply Stokes' Theorem. Since the loop does not enclose the vortex core (the singularity at the origin), the entire region `S` bounded by the loop `C` is a region of irrotational flow where `$(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = 0$`. Therefore, the surface integral of vorticity `$\\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$` over this region `S` is zero.",

This directly supported the conceptual understanding required to solve the problem using Stokes' theorem. Chunk 2 showed an example of calculating circulation when the vortex is enclosed, which helps contrast with this problem, and chunks 3 and 5 explicitly state the vorticity property of a free vortex."
