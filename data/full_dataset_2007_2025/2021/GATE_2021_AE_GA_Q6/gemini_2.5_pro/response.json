        "reasoning": "The problem can be solved by setting up a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Let point O be the origin $(0,0)$. East is defined as the positive x-direction and North as the positive y-direction.\n\n1.  **Initial Position (O):** $(0,0)$\n2.  **First Movement:** Travel 3 units East from O. The current position becomes $(0+3, 0) = (3,0)$.\n3.  **Second Movement:** Travel 4 units South from the current position to arrive at point P. Point P is $(3, 0-4) = (3, -4)$.\n4.  **Third Movement:** Travel from P in the North-East direction such that you arrive at a point R that is 6 units East of point O. This means the x-coordinate of R is 6. So, $R = (6, y_R)$. The description 'North-East direction' implies that the change in x-coordinate $(6-3=3)$ is positive (East) and the change in y-coordinate $(y_R - (-4) = y_R+4)$ is positive (North). This means $y_R > -4$. The exact value of $y_R$ is not explicitly given or needed for determining the final point Q.\n5.  **Fourth Movement:** Travel from R in the North-West direction, so that you arrive at point Q that is 8 units North of point P. Point P is $(3, -4)$. 8 units North of P means the x-coordinate remains the same as P (3), and the y-coordinate increases by 8. Thus, point Q is $(3, -4+8) = (3, 4)$. The description 'North-West direction' implies that the change in x-coordinate $(3-6=-3)$ is negative (West) and the change in y-coordinate $(4-y_R)$ is positive (North). This means $y_R < 4$. The conditions $y_R > -4$ and $y_R < 4$ are consistent, but $y_R$ itself is not uniquely determined or required to find Q.\n6.  **Distance of point Q to point O:** Point O is $(0,0)$ and point Q is $(3,4)$. Using the distance formula:\n    $d = \\sqrt{(x_Q - x_O)^2 + (y_Q - y_O)^2}$\n    $d = \\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2}$\n    $d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}$\n    $d = \\sqrt{9 + 16}$\n    $d = \\sqrt{25}$\n    $d = 5$ units.\n\nTherefore, the distance of point Q to point O is 5 units, which corresponds to option C."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Establish a Coordinate System.** Define point O as the origin $(0,0)$. Let East correspond to the positive x-axis and North to the positive y-axis. Consequently, West is negative x and South is negative y.",
          "**Step 2: Determine Coordinates of Point P.** The first movement is 3 units East from O, placing the traveler at $(3,0)$. The next movement is 4 units South from $(3,0)$, which leads to point P at $(3, 0-4) = (3, -4)$.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the Intermediate Point R.** The problem states travel from P in the North-East direction to a point R that is 6 units East of O. This directly gives the x-coordinate of R as 6. So, $R = (6, y_R)$. The 'North-East' description implies that the x-component of the vector $\\vec{PR}$ is positive ($6-3=3 > 0$) and the y-component is positive ($y_R - (-4) = y_R+4 > 0$, so $y_R > -4$). The exact value of $y_R$ is not determined by this statement alone, nor is it needed for the final answer.",
          "**Step 4: Determine Coordinates of the Final Point Q.** The problem states travel from R in the North-West direction to point Q, which is 8 units North of point P. Since $P = (3, -4)$, 8 units North of P means the x-coordinate of Q is the same as P's (3), and the y-coordinate is $P_y + 8$. Thus, $Q = (3, -4+8) = (3, 4)$. The 'North-West' description implies that the x-component of the vector $\\vec{RQ}$ is negative ($3-6=-3 < 0$) and the y-component is positive ($4-y_R > 0$, so $y_R < 4$). These conditions on $y_R$ are consistent with Step 3.",
          "**Step 5: Calculate the Distance from Q to O.** With point O at $(0,0)$ and point Q at $(3,4)$, use the 2D distance formula: $d = \\sqrt{(x_Q - x_O)^2 + (y_Q - y_O)^2}$. Substitute the coordinates: $d = \\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$ units."
