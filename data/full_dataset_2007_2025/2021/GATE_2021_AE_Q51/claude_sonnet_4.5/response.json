Uniformly distributed load of 20 kN/m over the length L/2 = 200 mm\n  2. A concentrated downward force at the free end equal to the reaction force at the support (R_B)\n- Using the formulas for deflection of a cantilever beam under a UDL and a concentrated load, we can set the total deflection at the free end to zero (since the roller provides a frictionless support).\n- Solving the equations, we get the reaction force R_B = 2.4 kN.\n- Since the reaction force is directed upwards, the compressive force on the roller is also 2.4 kN.\n\nTherefore, the compressive force experienced by the roller is 2.4 kN, which rounds off to 2.4 kN (to one decimal place)."
