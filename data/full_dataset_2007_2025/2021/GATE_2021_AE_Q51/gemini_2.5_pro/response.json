Beam AB deflects downwards due to the uniformly distributed load (UDL) and upwards due to the roller force. Beam DC deflects downwards due to the roller force. By equating the net downward deflection of beam AB at point B to the downward deflection of beam DC at point C, the unknown roller force can be determined. The calculation yields approximately 2.41 kN, which rounds to 2.4 kN, falling within the specified range of 2.2 to 2.6 kN."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the system and given data. Two cantilever beams, AB and DC, are connected by a roller at their free ends. Beam AB (length $L_{AB} = 400 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.4 \\, \\text{m}$) is subjected to a uniformly distributed load ($w = 20 \\, \\text{kN/m} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N/m}$). Beam DC (length $L_{DC} = 250 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}$) is initially unloaded. Both beams have a square cross-section ($50 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 50 \\, \\text{mm}$) and an elastic modulus ($E = 70 \\, \\text{GPa} = 70 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N/m}^2$).",
          "Step 2: Calculate the area moment of inertia ($I$) for the square cross-section. For a square section with side $b$, $I = \\frac{b^4}{12}$. Convert dimensions to meters: $b = 50 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.05 \\, \\text{m}$. So, $I = \\frac{(0.05 \\, \\text{m})^4}{12} = 5.20833 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}^4$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the principle of superposition. The roller at B/C introduces an unknown reaction force, $R$, making the problem statically indeterminate. We consider the deflections caused by the UDL and the roller force separately.",
          "Step 4: Formulate the compatibility equation. The roller ensures that the net vertical deflection at point B (of beam AB) is equal to the vertical deflection at point C (of beam DC). Let $R$ be the compressive force exerted by the roller. This force acts upwards on beam AB at B and downwards on beam DC at C. The net downward deflection of B is $\\Delta_B = \\delta_{AB,w} - \\delta_{AB,R}$, where $\\delta_{AB,w}$ is the downward deflection due to UDL and $\\delta_{AB,R}$ is the upward deflection due to $R$. The downward deflection of C is $\\Delta_C = \\delta_{DC,R}$. The compatibility condition is $\\Delta_B = \\Delta_C$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute standard cantilever beam deflection formulas into the compatibility equation. The deflection of a cantilever beam at its free end due to a UDL $w$ over its entire length $L$ is $\\delta_{UDL} = \\frac{wL^4}{8EI}$. The deflection of a cantilever beam at its free end due to a point load $P$ at the free end is $\\delta_{PL} = \\frac{PL^3}{3EI}$.",
          "Step 6: Set up the compatibility equation: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8EI} - \\frac{RL_{AB}^3}{3EI} = \\frac{RL_{DC}^3}{3EI}$. Since $E$ and $I$ are the same for both beams, they can be cancelled out: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8} - \\frac{RL_{AB}^3}{3} = \\frac{RL_{DC}^3}{3}$.",
          "Step 7: Solve for the unknown roller force $R$. Rearrange the equation: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8} = R \\left( \\frac{L_{AB}^3}{3} + \\frac{L_{DC}^3}{3} \\right) \\implies R = \\frac{3wL_{AB}^4}{8(L_{AB}^3 + L_{DC}^3)}$.",
          "Step 8: Substitute numerical values and calculate $R$. $R = \\frac{3 \\times (20 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N/m}) \\times (0.4 \\, \\text{m})^4}{8 \\times ((0.4 \\, \\text{m})^3 + (0.25 \\, \\text{m})^3)} = \\frac{3 \\times 20000 \\times 0.0256}{8 \\times (0.064 + 0.015625)} = \\frac{1536}{8 \\times 0.079625} = \\frac{1536}{0.637} \\approx 2411.30 \\, \\text{N}$.",
          "Step 9: Convert to kN and round off. $R \\approx 2.4113 \\, \\text{kN}$. Rounding to one decimal place, the compressive force experienced by the roller is $2.4 \\, \\text{kN}$."
