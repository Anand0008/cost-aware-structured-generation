        "reasoning": "In the ideal Brayton cycle, which serves as the theoretical model for gas turbine engines like the turbo-shaft engine, the combustion process is idealized as a constant pressure (isobaric) heat addition process. This assumption simplifies the thermodynamic analysis, allowing for the calculation of theoretical performance benchmarks. While real combustors experience some pressure drop due to friction and flow dynamics, this is neglected in the ideal cycle analysis. The retrieved knowledge explicitly states this: 'Combustion (02-03): Heat is added to the air at constant stagnation pressure' (Chunk 2) and 'In an ideal cycle, flow through the combustor and heat exchangers is assumed to be an isobaric (constant pressure) process' (Chunk 3)."
