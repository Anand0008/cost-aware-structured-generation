This is because the lift force acts downwards, adding to the weight of the aircraft, resulting in a net downward force. The load factor 'n' is defined as the ratio of the lift force to the weight of the aircraft. Since the lift force is acting downwards, the load factor 'n' will be negative. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: n > -1."
