        "reasoning": "At the top of an inverted vertical loop, the aircraft is upside down. For steady curved flight, the net centripetal force must act downward towards the center of the loop. Weight (W) always acts downward. For an inverted aircraft, the lift force (L) generated by the wings is also directed downward (negative relative to the aircraft's usual upright orientation). The load factor is defined as n = L/W. At the top of the inverted loop, both L and W are downward, so L is negative (if we maintain the standard sign convention where upward lift is positive). Therefore, n is negative. For the aircraft to maintain the curved path, the magnitude of the downward lift must be less than the weight (|L| < W) to provide the correct net centripetal force (W + L_down = mV^2/R, requiring L_down > -W). This implies n = L/W > -1. Hence, n is negative but greater than -1. Options A and B (n=1, n<1) are for upright flight. Option C (n=-1) is a special case where lift exactly equals weight in the downward direction, which is not generally required for a steady turn."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Visualize the maneuver. A 360° inverted vertical loop means the aircraft flies a complete circle in the vertical plane while upside down at the top.",
          "Step 2: Identify force directions at the topmost point. The aircraft is inverted. Weight (W) acts downward toward the center of the Earth. For the aircraft to follow a curved path, a centripetal force must act downward toward the center of the loop's curvature (which is below the aircraft).",
          "Step 3: Determine lift direction. In an inverted maneuver, the pilot typically commands negative lift (downward relative to the aircraft's top) to help pull the aircraft downward. Thus, the aerodynamic lift force (L) is also directed downward at the top of the loop.",
          "Step 4: Apply force balance perpendicular to the flight path (radial direction). For steady circular motion at constant speed, net radial force = centripetal force = m*V^2/R. Taking downward as positive toward the center: W + L_down = m * V^2 / R, where L_down is the magnitude of the downward lift (a positive number).",
          "Step 5: Define load factor. Load factor n = L / W, where L is the lift force in the aircraft's body-fixed vertical direction (usually positive upward). For downward lift, L is negative. Let L = -L_down. Substitute into the force equation: W + (-L) = m*V^2/R => W - L = m*V^2/R.",
          "Step 6: Express in terms of n. Since n = L/W, then L = nW. Substitute: W - nW = (W/g) * (V^2/R) => (1 - n)W = (W/g)*(V^2/R).",
          "Step 7: Analyze the inequality. For a real, finite turn radius R, V^2/(gR) > 0. Therefore, (1 - n) > 0 => 1 > n => n < 1. Also, since lift is downward, n is negative. Combining: -1 < n < 0? Not necessarily; n could be less than -1 if the downward lift magnitude exceeds weight. However, from the force equation: W - nW = positive => if n is very negative (e.g., n < -1), then W - nW = W(1 - n) becomes > 2W, implying a very high centripetal force. This is possible but not required for a steady turn. The key is that the equation W - nW = m*V^2/R does not forbid n < -1. But let's reconsider the physical setup: In an inverted loop, the pilot can control the load factor. For a conventional aircraft not designed for high negative g, the limiting negative load factor is often greater than -1 (e.g., -0.5 to -1). More fundamentally, for the aircraft to be in a sustained, steady inverted loop (not just a transient dive), the wing must generate downward lift, but the net downward force (W + L_down) must be positive and finite. There's no lower bound from the equation alone except structural limits. However, the question asks for the load factor at the topmost point, assuming steady flight. If n ≤ -1, then L_down ≥ W, meaning the downward lift is at least equal to weight. Then the net downward force is ≥ 2W, leading to a very small turn radius. This is possible but extreme. The more typical and stable condition for a conventional aircraft is to have downward lift less than weight (|L| < W) to avoid overstressing and maintain control, implying n > -1. Given the options and standard interpretation, n > -1 is the correct choice."

Chunk 1 explicitly discusses pull-down maneuver and gives formula R = V^2/(g*(n+1)) where n is magnitude of load factor, which directly informs the force balance. Chunk 4 and 5 provide textbook context. However, the RAG does not explicitly state the inequality n > -1 for inverted loop tops, requiring derivation and interpretation. Overall, RAG context is very helpful for building the explanation."
