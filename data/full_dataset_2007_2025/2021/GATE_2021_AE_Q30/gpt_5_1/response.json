        "reasoning": "At the top of a 360\\u00b0 inverted vertical loop, the aircraft is upside down and the flight is assumed steady (no normal acceleration other than centripetal). For a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, lift always acts approximately normal to the wing and toward its pressure (low-pressure) side. In an inverted attitude, this direction is downward in the Earth frame, same as weight. Thus at the top of the loop, both lift L and weight W point toward the center of curvature (downwards). The centripetal force requirement is \\(m V^2 / R\\), so the force balance normal to the flight path is \\(L + W = m V^2 / R\\). The load factor is defined as \\(n = L/W\\). Since L is downward like W, its magnitude is positive and must be nonzero to sustain the loop. Therefore \\(L > 0\\) and hence \\(n = L/W > 0\\). However, because the aircraft is inverted, the pilot and structure experience a negative g (apparent weight upwards), often denoted as a negative load factor in flight mechanics sign convention. In that convention, the load factor at the top is negative, but its magnitude is less than 1 in a typical steady top-of-loop condition if the speed and radius are such that gravity contributes significantly to centripetal force. The key point for this question is that the load factor cannot be exactly -1 (that would mean L = -W, i.e., lift equal in magnitude to weight but opposite direction, which would not match the requirement L and W both pointing to the center). In a steady inverted top-of-loop, the centripetal force is \\(L + W\\), so \\(L\\) must be less than W for moderate-g loops, giving a negative load factor whose magnitude is less than 1: \\(-1 < n < 0\\). Among the options, this corresponds to 'n > -1' when n is negative. Hence option D is correct and consistent with standard pull-down analysis (Anderson, Accelerated Flight notes: pull-down maneuver with \\(R = V^2 / (g (n + 1))\\) where lift and weight both contribute to centripetal force)."

          "Step 1: Recognize the maneuver: a 360\\u00b0 inverted vertical loop. At the topmost point, the aircraft is upside down and moving horizontally, with the center of the loop below it.",
          "Step 2: Identify force directions at the top. For a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, lift is approximately normal to the wing and toward the low-pressure side. In inverted flight, this is downward in the Earth frame. Weight always acts downward. So both L and W point toward the center of curvature.",
          "Step 3: Write the centripetal force balance normal to the flight path: the net force toward the center equals \\(m V^2 / R\\). Thus, at the top, \\(L + W = m V^2 / R\\).",
          "Step 4: Define load factor. In flight mechanics, load factor is \\(n = L/W\\). Here, L is nonzero and acts in the same direction as W, so its magnitude is positive and less than W for a moderate-g loop.",
          "Step 5: Consider sign convention. In many texts, positive n corresponds to lift acting upward (pilot pushed into seat). At the top of an inverted loop, lift is downward, so n is negative. But since |L| < W typically, we have \\(-1 < n < 0\\).",
          "Step 6: Evaluate options: (A) n = 1 (wrong: that would be upright 1g level flight), (B) n < 1 (too broad; includes positive n < 1, which is not the case here), (C) n = -1 (would imply |L| = W downward, which does not match the general steady top-of-loop relation), (D) n > -1 (true for the negative n we have, since -1 < n < 0). Therefore, D is the best and correct choice."
