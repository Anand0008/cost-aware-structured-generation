    "question_text": "An airplane weighing 5500 kg is in a steady level flight with a speed of 225 m/s. The pilot initiates a steady pull-up maneuver with a radius of curvature of 775 m. The location of center of gravity (CG), center of pressure on wing (CP) and point of action (T) of tail force are marked in the figure. Use g = 9.81 m/s². Neglect drag on the tail and assume that tail force is vertical. Assuming the engine thrust and drag to be equal, opposite and collinear, the tail force is_____________ kN (round off to one decimal place)."
