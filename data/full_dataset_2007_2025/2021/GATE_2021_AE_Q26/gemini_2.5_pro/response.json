        "reasoning": "The system is a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rotational system. To find its natural frequency, we need to determine the equivalent mass moment of inertia ($I_{eq}$) and the equivalent rotational stiffness ($K_{eq}$) about the pivot point.\n\n1.  **Equivalent Mass Moment of Inertia ($I_{eq}$):**\n    The rod is massless. The mass $m$ is attached at a point that is horizontally $L$ from the pivot and vertically $H$ from the end of the horizontal segment. The distance $r$ from the pivot to the mass $m$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides $L$ and $H$. Therefore, $r = \\sqrt{L^2 + H^2}$.\n    The mass moment of inertia of a point mass $m$ about a pivot at distance $r$ is $I_{eq} = mr^2$.\n    $I_{eq} = m (\\sqrt{L^2 + H^2})^2 = m(L^2 + H^2)$.\n\n2.  **Equivalent Rotational Stiffness ($K_{eq}$):**\n    The linear spring of stiffness $k$ is attached at a horizontal distance $L/2$ from the pivot. Let the rod undergo a small angular displacement $\\theta$ from its equilibrium position. The linear deflection of the spring, $\\delta_s$, at its attachment point is $\\delta_s = (L/2) \\theta$ (using the small angle approximation).\n    The restoring force exerted by the spring is $F_s = k \\delta_s = k (L/2) \\theta$.\n    The restoring moment $M_s$ about the pivot due to this spring force is $M_s = F_s \\times (L/2)$.\n    $M_s = (k (L/2) \\theta) \\times (L/2) = k \\frac{L^2}{4} \\theta$.\n    The equivalent rotational stiffness $K_{eq}$ is the coefficient of $\\theta$ in the restoring moment equation: $K_{eq} = k \\frac{L^2}{4}$.\n\n3.  **Natural Angular Frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    For an SDOF rotational system, the natural angular frequency is $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eq}}{I_{eq}}}$.\n    Substituting the expressions for $K_{eq}$ and $I_{eq}$:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k \\frac{L^2}{4}}{m(L^2 + H^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k L^2}{4m(L^2 + H^2)}}$ (rad/s).\n\n4.  **Natural Frequency ($f_n$):**\n    The natural frequency in Hertz is $f_n = \\frac{\\omega_n}{2\\pi}$.\n    $f_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k L^2}{4m(L^2 + H^2)}}$ (Hz).\n\nThis derived formula matches option A."

          "description": "Instead of using Newton's second law, this method involves formulating the kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V) of the system. For free vibration, the equation of motion is derived from Lagrange's equation: $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. This typically leads to an equation of the form $I_{eq}\\ddot{\\theta} + K_{eq}\\theta = 0$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Often more systematic for complex systems, handles conservative forces easily. Cons: Requires careful calculation of kinetic and potential energy terms, can be more involved for simple systems.",
          "when_to_use": "Recommended for systems with multiple masses, springs, or gravitational potential energy effects, or when the direct force/moment approach becomes cumbersome."
