Analysis of the system using small-angle approximation and rotational dynamics leads to the natural frequency formula $f_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{kL^2}{4m(L^2+H^2)}}$. This matches option A. The derivation involves finding the equivalent torsional stiffness contributed by the spring and the mass moment of inertia of the point mass about the pivot."
