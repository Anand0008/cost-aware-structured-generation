The mass \\(m\\) is at coordinates \\((L, H)\\) from the pivot, so its distance from the pivot is \\(r = \\sqrt{L^2 + H^2}\\). For small rotation, its vertical displacement is \\(y_m = r\\,\\theta\\) (arc length approximation). The spring is attached at the mid-point of the horizontal segment, at distance \\(L/2\\) from the pivot. Its vertical displacement is therefore \\(y_s = (L/2)\\,\\theta\\). The spring force is \\(F_s = k y_s = k (L/2)\\theta\\). This force produces a restoring moment about the pivot: \\(M_s = F_s (L/2) = k (L/2)^2 \\theta = k L^2 \\theta /4\\). The only inertia is due to the point mass: its mass moment of inertia about the pivot is \\(I = m r^2 = m(L^2 + H^2)\\). Applying rotational equation of motion about the pivot, \\(I\\,\\ddot{\\theta} + M_s = 0\\) gives \\(m(L^2 + H^2)\\ddot{\\theta} + (k L^2/4)\\theta = 0\\). Comparing with standard SDOF form \\(I\\ddot{\\theta} + K_{\\text{eq}}\\theta = 0\\), the natural circular frequency is \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{eq}}/I} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k L^2}{4 m (L^2 + H^2)}}\\).

        "notes": "RAG provided related material on SDOF torsional systems, rigid members with springs, and rotor-shaft systems. While not exactly the same geometry, they reinforced the core idea: equation of motion for rotational SDOF systems with equivalent stiffness K_eq and inertia I. The specific L-shaped geometry and use of L/2 came from internal reasoning."
