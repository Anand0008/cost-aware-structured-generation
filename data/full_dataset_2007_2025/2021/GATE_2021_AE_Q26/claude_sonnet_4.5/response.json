The key steps are:\n\n1. The system consists of a rigid massless rod pinned at one end, with a mass m attached to the other end. The rod is supported by a linear spring of stiffness k.\n2. The rotational inertia of the system is given by I_p = m*L^2, where L is the length of the rod.\n3. The restoring moment provided by the spring is K_eq_rot = k*L^2.\n4. Applying Newton's second law for rotational motion, the equation of motion is: I_p*theta'' + K_eq_rot*theta = 0\n5. Substituting the expressions for I_p and K_eq_rot, the natural angular frequency is:\n   omega_n = sqrt(K_eq_rot / I_p) = sqrt((k*L^2) / (m*L^2)) = sqrt(k/m)\n6. The natural frequency in Hz is f_n = omega_n / (2*pi) = (1/2*pi) * sqrt(k/m)\n7. This matches the expression given in option A, which is the correct answer."
