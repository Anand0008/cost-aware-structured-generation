        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the total propellant mass burned. This can be achieved by first determining the mass flow rate using the thrust equation and then multiplying by the burn duration. The specific impulse is given in Ns/kg, which is equivalent to m/s (effective exhaust velocity). The fundamental thrust equation is $F = \\dot{m} I_{sp}$, where $I_{sp}$ is in Ns/kg (or m/s). Given $F = 25 \\times 10^6$ N and $I_{sp} = 2980$ Ns/kg, the mass flow rate is $\\dot{m} = F / I_{sp} = (25 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N}) / (2980 \\text{ Ns/kg}) \\approx 8389.26 \\text{ kg/s}$. The total propellant mass burned is then $m_p = \\dot{m} \\times t_b = (8389.26 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (150 \\text{ s}) \\approx 1,258,389 \\text{ kg}$, which is approximately $1.26 \\times 10^6 \\text{ kg}$.
