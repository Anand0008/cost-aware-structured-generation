The conditions state that side PQ is divided into 4 equal parts, QR into 6, and PR into 8. The length of each subdivided part is an integer. This implies that $L$ must be an integer multiple of 4, 6, and 8 simultaneously. To find the minimum possible length $L$, we need to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 4, 6, and 8.\n\n1.  Prime factorization of the numbers:\n    *   $4 = 2^2$\n    *   $6 = 2 \\times 3$\n    *   $8 = 2^3$\n\n2.  LCM(4, 6, 8) is found by taking the highest power of all prime factors present:\n    *   $LCM = 2^3 \\times 3^1 = 8 \\times 3 = 24$.\n\n3.  Therefore, the minimum possible side length of the equilateral triangle PQR is $L = 24$ cm.\n\n4.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $L$ is given by the formula $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} L^2$.\n\n5.  Substitute the minimum side length $L=24$ cm into the area formula:\n    *   $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (24)^2$\n    *   $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 576$\n    *   $A = 144\\sqrt{3}$ cm$^2$.\n\nThis matches option D."
