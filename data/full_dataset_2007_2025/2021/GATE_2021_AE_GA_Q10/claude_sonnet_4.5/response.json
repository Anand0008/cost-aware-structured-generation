The length of each subdivided part is an integer in cm.\n\nTo solve this:\n1. Let the length of each subdivided part be 'x' cm.\n2. The length of side PQ = 4x cm, side QR = 6x cm, and side PR = 8x cm.\n3. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides must be equal. Therefore, 4x = 6x = 8x, which implies x = 3 cm.\n4. The length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 4 * 3 = 12 cm.\n5. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by (√3/4) * a^2, where 'a' is the length of one side.\n6. Substituting a = 12 cm, the area of the triangle PQR is (√3/4) * (12)^2 = 144√3 cm²."
