The crucial sentence is, 'In my opinion, it is no less important for public speakers to rehearse their talks.' The phrase 'no less important' means that rehearsing is at least as important for public speakers as it is for musicians and actors. Therefore, the author's opinion is that rehearsing is important for all three groups: musicians, actors, and public speakers. Option A accurately reflects this comprehensive view."
