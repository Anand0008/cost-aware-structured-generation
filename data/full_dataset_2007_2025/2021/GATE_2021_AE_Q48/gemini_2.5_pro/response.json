The energy balance accounts for the enthalpy of the incoming air, the chemical energy released by the fuel (modified by burner efficiency), and the enthalpy of the outgoing combustion gases. Crucially, the problem statement explicitly instructs not to neglect the fuel flow rate in the total mass flow rate of the combustion products. By setting up the energy balance equation: $\\dot{m}_a C_{p,air} T_{T3} + \\dot{m}_f Q_{HV} \\eta_b = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_{p,gas} T_{T4}$, and substituting the given values ($\\dot{m}_a = 100$ kg/s, $T_{T3} = 600$ K, $T_{T4} = 1200$ K, $\\eta_b = 0.90$, $Q_{HV} = 40 \\times 10^6$ J/kg, $C_{p,air} = 1000$ J/kg-K, $C_{p,gas} = 1200$ J/kg-K), we can solve for $\\dot{m}_f$.

    "question_text": "The air flow rate through the gas generator of a turboprop engine is 100 kg/s. The stagnation temperatures at inlet and exit of the combustor are 600 K and 1200 K, respectively. The burner efficiency is 90% and the heating value of the fuel is 40 MJ/kg. The specific heats at constant pressure (C_p) for air and burned gases are 1000 J/kg-K and 1200 J/kg-K, respectively. The flow rate of the fuel being used is _____________ kg/s (round off to two decimal places).\n(Note: Do not neglect the fuel flow rate with respect to the air flow rate)"
