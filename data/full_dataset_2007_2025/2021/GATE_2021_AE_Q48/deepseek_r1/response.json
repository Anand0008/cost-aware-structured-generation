This directly matches the problem's requirements. Other chunks (1,4,5) are about rocket gas generators and ideal cycles, less relevant but show similar thermodynamic principles. The RAG was sufficient to solve the problem."

The burner efficiency is 90% and the heating value of the fuel is 40 MJ/kg. The specific heats at constant pressure (C_p) for air and burned gases are 1000 J/kg-K and 1200 J/kg-K, respectively. The flow rate of the fuel being used is _____________ kg/s (round off to two decimal places).\n(Note: Do not neglect the fuel flow rate with respect to the air flow rate)"
