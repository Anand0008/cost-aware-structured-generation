First, the stress components $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\tau_{xy}$ must be correctly identified from the provided figure, paying close attention to sign conventions.\n\nFrom the figure:\n*   Normal stress in x-direction, $\\sigma_x$: The arrows on the left and right faces point inwards, indicating compression. So, $\\sigma_x = -80 \\text{ MPa}$.\n*   Normal stress in y-direction, $\\sigma_y$: The arrows on the top and bottom faces point inwards, indicating compression. So, $\\sigma_y = -20 \\text{ MPa}$.\n*   Shear stress, $\\tau_{xy}$: On the positive x-face (right face), the shear stress arrow points downwards (negative y-direction). On the positive y-face (top face), the shear stress arrow points left (negative x-direction). According to the standard sign convention (positive $\\tau_{xy}$ causes counter-clockwise rotation), this configuration indicates a negative shear stress. So, $\\tau_{xy} = -30 \\text{ MPa}$.\n\nThe formula for the orientation of the planes of maximum shear stress $(\\theta_S)$ is given by:\n$\\tan(2\\theta_S) = -\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2\\tau_{xy}}$\n\nSubstitute the identified stress values into the formula:\n$\\tan(2\\theta_S) = -\\frac{(-80) - (-20)}{2 \\times (-30)}$\n$\\tan(2\\theta_S) = -\\frac{-80 + 20}{-60}$\n$\\tan(2\\theta_S) = -\\frac{-60}{-60}$\n$\\tan(2\\theta_S) = -1$\n\nNow, solve for $\\theta_S$:\n$2\\theta_S = \\arctan(-1)$\nThe principal value for $\\arctan(-1)$ is $-45^\\circ$.\nTherefore, $\\theta_S = \\frac{-45^\\circ}{2} = -22.5^\\circ$.\n\nThe other plane of maximum shear stress is $-22.5^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 67.5^\\circ$.\nComparing with the given options, $-22.5^\\circ$ matches option D."

Chunk 5 was a relevant worked example for principal stresses, reinforcing the overall context. Chunk 6 was less relevant as it focused on 3D stress, while the question was 2D."
