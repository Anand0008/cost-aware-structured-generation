          "Step 1: Identify the system parameters. We have two cantilever beams made of the same homogenous material (constant Young's modulus $E$ and density $\\rho$) and identical cross-sections (constant area moment of inertia $I$ and cross-sectional area $A$). They differ only in length: Beam 1 has length $l$, and Beam 2 has length $2l$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for the fundamental (first) natural frequency of a uniform cantilever beam with distributed mass. The angular natural frequency $\\omega_n$ for the $n$-th mode is given by $\\omega_n = (\\beta_n L)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A L^4}}$, where $\\beta_n L$ is a constant for each mode and boundary condition. For the first mode of a cantilever beam, $\\beta_1 L = 1.875$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the proportionality of the natural frequency with respect to length. Since $E$, $I$, $\\rho$, and $A$ are constant for both beams, the formula simplifies to $\\omega_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$.",
          "Step 4: Set up the ratio of the natural frequencies. Let $\\omega_1$ be the natural frequency of Beam 1 and $\\omega_2$ be the natural frequency of Beam 2. We can write $\\omega_1 = C/L_1^2$ and $\\omega_2 = C/L_2^2$, where $C$ is a constant incorporating $E$, $I$, $\\rho$, $A$, and the mode constant.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the given lengths into the ratio. For Beam 1, $L_1 = l$. For Beam 2, $L_2 = 2l$. The ratio is $\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega_2} = \\frac{C/L_1^2}{C/L_2^2} = \\frac{L_2^2}{L_1^2}$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the ratio. $\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega_2} = \\frac{(2l)^2}{l^2} = \\frac{4l^2}{l^2} = 4$.",
          "Step 7: Round off to the nearest integer. The calculated ratio is exactly 4, so rounding to the nearest integer gives 4."
