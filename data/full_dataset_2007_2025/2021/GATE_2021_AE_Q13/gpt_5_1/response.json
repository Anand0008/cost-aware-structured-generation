        "reasoning": "Trim occurs where the pitching moment coefficient about CG is zero, i.e., where the Cm-\\alpha curve crosses the Cm = 0 axis. From the figure, the curve passes through the origin and has positive slope there. The origin corresponds to \\alpha = 0, Cm = 0, so one trim point is at \\alpha = 0. The straight portion of the curve clearly crosses Cm = 0 again at a positive \\alpha (to the right of the origin), so the aircraft can trim at a positive angle of attack. Static longitudinal stability requires \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0 at the trim point. However, the plotted curve has a positive slope (Cm increases with \\alpha) in the region where it crosses Cm = 0. Hence \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} > 0, which corresponds to static instability. Therefore, the aircraft can trim at a positive \\alpha but is statically unstable, matching option B."

          "Step 4: Inspect the slope of the Cm-\\alpha curve in the region where it crosses Cm = 0 at positive \\alpha. The curve is increasing with \\alpha (positive slope), so C_{m_\\alpha} > 0 there.",
