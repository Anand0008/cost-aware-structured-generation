Mathematically, $F \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset$. Let's call this intersecting group 'X'. So, X is a subset of F and X is a subset of C. ($X \\subseteq F$ and $X \\subseteq C$)\n\nStatement 2: 'All cricket players play hockey.'\nThis means the set C is a subset of the set H. Mathematically, $C \\subseteq H$.\n\nNow, we need to find a logical conclusion from these two statements.\nSince 'Some football players play cricket' (i.e., set X exists and is part of F and C), and 'All cricket players play hockey' (i.e., C is entirely contained within H), it logically follows that the group X (which consists of football players who also play cricket) must also play hockey because all cricket players play hockey.\n\nTherefore, 'Some football players play hockey' is the correct deduction.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA. 'No football player plays hockey.' - This contradicts our deduction.\nB. 'Some football players play hockey.' - This matches our deduction.\nC. 'All football players play hockey.' - We only know that *some* football players (those who play cricket) play hockey. We don't have information about *all* football players.\nD. 'All hockey players play football.' - This is an inverse statement and cannot be deduced. Just because all cricket players play hockey doesn't mean all hockey players play cricket, nor does it mean all hockey players play football."
