        "reasoning": "In the lab (moving-shock) frame, the upstream gas is stationary: V1 = 0, so its stagnation state equals its static state: T01 = T1 and p01 = p1. When we shift to the shock-fixed frame, the shock is stationary and the gas ahead moves toward it with speed Vs, so the upstream stagnation temperature and pressure increase: T01' > T01 and p01' > p01. However, static properties (p, T, \\rho) are frame-invariant because they depend only on the thermodynamic state, not on the observer’s velocity. Therefore T1' = T1 and p1' = p1, and similarly \\rho2' = \\rho2. Across a normal shock, static pressure always increases: p2 > p1 = p01 (since upstream gas was at rest). Also, in the shock-fixed frame, the upstream Mach number is supersonic and the downstream Mach number is subsonic, so T2' < T01 (the upstream stagnation temperature in the lab frame). Putting these facts together: (i) T1' = T1 (static temperature invariant), (ii) p2 > p01 (static pressure behind the shock exceeds the initial stagnation pressure of the still gas), (iii) T01' > T01 (stagnation temperature increases when we add kinetic energy by changing frame), and (iv) p01' > p01 (stagnation pressure also increases when viewed in the moving frame). Option D matches all these correct relations; the other options contradict either frame invariance of static properties or basic normal-shock behavior."
