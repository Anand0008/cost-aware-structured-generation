        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements relating flow properties between a 'Moving Shock Problem' (lab frame) and a 'Stationary Shock Problem' (shock-fixed frame), where the shock moves into a stationary gas in the lab frame.\n\nLet's denote properties in the lab frame as $P_1, T_1, \\rho_1, P_{01}, T_{01}$ (upstream) and $P_2, T_2, \\rho_2, P_{02}, T_{02}$ (downstream). In the shock-fixed frame, these are $P_1', T_1', \\rho_1', P_{01}', T_{01}'$ (upstream) and $P_2', T_2', \\rho_2', P_{02}', T_{02}'$ (downstream).\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1.  **Static Properties:** Static pressure ($P$), temperature ($T$), and density ($\\rho$) are independent of the frame of reference. Therefore, $P_1' = P_1$, $T_1' = T_1$, $\\rho_1' = \\rho_1$, and $P_2' = P_2$, $T_2' = T_2$, $\\rho_2' = \\rho_2$.\n2.  **Upstream Velocity:** In the lab frame, the gas ahead of the shock is stationary, so $V_1 = 0$. In the shock-fixed frame, the gas approaches the stationary shock with a velocity equal to the shock speed, $V_1' = V_s$.\n3.  **Stagnation Properties:** Stagnation properties ($P_0, T_0$) depend on the velocity relative to the observer. They are defined as the properties if the flow were brought isentropically to rest.\n    *   For the stationary gas in the lab frame ($V_1=0$): $P_{01} = P_1$ and $T_{01} = T_1$.\n    *   For the gas approaching the stationary shock in the shock-fixed frame ($V_1' = V_s > 0$): $P_{01}' = P_1' (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$ and $T_{01}' = T_1' (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)$. Since $M_1' = V_s/a_1 > 1$ (for a shock), it implies $P_{01}' > P_1'$ and $T_{01}' > T_1'$.\n    *   Comparing stagnation properties between frames: Since $P_1' = P_1$ and $T_1' = T_1$, it follows that $P_{01}' > P_{01}$ and $T_{01}' > T_{01}$.\n4.  **Across a Normal Shock:** Pressure, temperature, and density always increase across a normal shock. So, $P_2 > P_1$, $T_2 > T_1$, $\\rho_2 > \\rho_1$.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. $T_1' > T_1$, $T_{01}' > T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' > \\rho_1'$**\n    *   $T_1' > T_1$: False. Static temperature is frame-independent, so $T_1' = T_1$.\n    *   (The rest of the statements are true, but the first one makes the option incorrect).\n\n*   **B. $T_1' = T_1$, $T_2' < T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' = \\rho_2$**\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True.\n    *   $T_2' < T_{01}$: False. We know $T_2' = T_2$ and $T_{01} = T_1$. Across a shock, $T_2 > T_1$. So $T_2' > T_{01}$.\n    *   (The rest of the statements are true, but the second one makes the option incorrect).\n\n*   **C. $T_1' < T_1$, $p_1' > p_1$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' > \\rho_1$**\n    *   $T_1' < T_1$: False. Static temperature is frame-independent, so $T_1' = T_1$.\n    *   $p_1' > p_1$: False. Static pressure is frame-independent, so $p_1' = p_1$.\n    *   (The rest of the statements are true, but the first two make the option incorrect).\n\n*   **D. $T_1' = T_1$, $p_2 > p_{01}$, $T_{01}' > T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$**\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True. Static temperature is frame-independent.\n    *   $p_2 > p_{01}$: True. Since $V_1=0$, $p_{01} = p_1$. Across a normal shock, static pressure always increases, so $p_2 > p_1$. Thus, $p_2 > p_{01}$.\n    *   $T_{01}' > T_{01}$: True. As derived above, since $V_1' = V_s > 0$ and $V_1 = 0$, the stagnation temperature in the shock-fixed frame upstream ($T_{01}'$) will be greater than the stagnation temperature in the lab frame upstream ($T_{01}$). Specifically, $T_{01}' = T_1 + \\frac{V_s^2}{2C_p}$ while $T_{01} = T_1$.\n    *   $p_{01}' > p_{01}$: True. As derived above, since $V_1' = V_s > 0$ and $V_1 = 0$, the stagnation pressure in the shock-fixed frame upstream ($P_{01}'$) will be greater than the stagnation pressure in the lab frame upstream ($P_{01}$). Specifically, $P_{01}' = P_1 (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$ while $P_{01} = P_1$.\n\nAll statements in option D are true."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the problem setup. The question describes a transformation from a 'Moving Shock Problem' (lab frame, where the shock moves into stationary gas) to a 'Stationary Shock Problem' (shock-fixed frame, where the shock is stationary and the gas approaches it). The image provides the notation for properties in both frames (unprimed for lab frame, primed for shock-fixed frame).",
          "Step 2: Recall the behavior of static properties (pressure $P$, temperature $T$, density $\\rho$) during a frame of reference transformation. Static properties are independent of the observer's frame of reference. Therefore, $P_1' = P_1$, $T_1' = T_1$, $\\rho_1' = \\rho_1$, and similarly for downstream properties $P_2' = P_2$, $T_2' = T_2$, $\\rho_2' = \\rho_2$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the behavior of stagnation properties ($P_0, T_0$) during a frame of reference transformation. Stagnation properties depend on the kinetic energy of the flow, and thus on the velocity relative to the observer. In the lab frame, the upstream gas is stationary ($V_1=0$), so its stagnation properties are equal to its static properties: $P_{01} = P_1$ and $T_{01} = T_1$. In the shock-fixed frame, the upstream gas approaches the shock with a velocity $V_1' = V_s$ (the shock speed). Since $V_s > 0$, the stagnation properties in this frame will be greater than the static properties: $P_{01}' > P_1'$ and $T_{01}' > T_1'$.",
          "Step 4: Compare the upstream stagnation properties between the two frames. Since $P_1' = P_1$ and $T_1' = T_1$, and $P_{01}' > P_1'$ and $T_{01}' > T_1'$, it directly follows that $P_{01}' > P_{01}$ and $T_{01}' > T_{01}$.",
          "Step 5: Recall the property changes across a normal shock. Across a normal shock, static pressure, temperature, and density always increase. So, $P_2 > P_1$, $T_2 > T_1$, $\\rho_2 > \\rho_1$.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate each statement in the given options based on the principles established in Steps 2-5. Identify which option contains only true statements. For example, for option D:\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True (static temperature is frame-independent).\n    *   $p_2 > p_{01}$: True ($p_{01} = p_1$ since $V_1=0$. Across a shock, $p_2 > p_1$).\n    *   $T_{01}' > T_{01}$: True (stagnation temperature increases due to relative velocity in the shock-fixed frame).\n    *   $p_{01}' > p_{01}$: True (stagnation pressure increases due to relative velocity in the shock-fixed frame)."
