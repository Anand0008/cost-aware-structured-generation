        "reasoning": "The image shows that in the stationary shock frame (right side), the upstream stagnation temperature (T'₀₁) and upstream stagnation pressure (p'₀₁) are higher than in the moving shock frame (left side). This is because the shock is stationary in the right frame, so the upstream flow velocity (V's) is lower than the shock speed (Vs) in the left frame. The lower upstream velocity in the stationary frame results in higher stagnation properties. Additionally, the downstream static temperature (T'₂) is lower than the upstream stagnation temperature (T'₀₁) in the stationary frame, as expected for a normal shock. Therefore, option D correctly describes the relationships between the flow properties in the two reference frames."
