They provided context on solving second-order ODEs with constant coefficients, forming characteristic equations, finding general solutions, and applying conditions (though the RAG focused on Boundary Value Problems, the underlying ODE solution method and application of conditions is identical for Initial Value Problems). The provided examples of characteristic equations and general solutions for different root types were directly applicable. Chunks 2 and 5 were not relevant."
