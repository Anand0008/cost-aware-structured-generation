        "reasoning": "For a convergent-divergent nozzle: if exit pressure $P_e$ is lower than ambient/back pressure $P_b$, the jet is over-expanded and compression via oblique shocks occurs at/just outside the exit. If $P_e$ is higher than $P_b$, the jet is under-expanded and Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans form at the exit to further expand the flow. In the figure, Nozzle A shows an oblique shock at the exit followed by an expansion fan, which is characteristic of an over-expanded jet adjusting to higher ambient pressure. Nozzle B shows only expansion fans at the exit, typical of an under-expanded jet adjusting to lower ambient pressure. Therefore, Nozzle A is over-expanded and Nozzle B is under-expanded, corresponding to option A."

          "Step 1: Recall nozzle exit classifications. If $P_e < P_b$, the nozzle is over-expanded and the jet must be compressed by oblique shocks. If $P_e > P_b$, the nozzle is under-expanded and the jet must be expanded by Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans. If $P_e = P_b$, it is perfectly expanded and no strong external waves appear.",
          "Step 2: Examine Nozzle A in the schematic. At the exit, an oblique shock is drawn, followed downstream by an expansion fan. The presence of an oblique shock right at the exit indicates that the jet static pressure is too low compared to ambient and must be increased via compression.",
          "Step 3: Therefore, Nozzle A corresponds to an over-expanded jet: $P_e < P_b$.",
          "Step 4: Examine Nozzle B. At the exit, only expansion fans are drawn, turning the flow outward. Expansion fans occur when the jet pressure is higher than ambient and needs to decrease via isentropic expansion.",
          "Step 5: Therefore, Nozzle B corresponds to an under-expanded jet: $P_e > P_b$.",
          "Step 6: Match this interpretation with the options: A states 'over-expanded mode and under-expanded mode' for nozzles A and B, respectively, which matches our conclusion."
