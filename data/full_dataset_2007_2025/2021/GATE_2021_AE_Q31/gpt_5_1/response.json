Hence their product is continuous for all $x>0$, including $x=2\\pi$. So option D is true.\\n\\n2) Differentiability: Away from zeros of $\\cos x$, $\\lvert\\cos x\\rvert$ equals either $\\cos x$ or $-\\cos x$, both smooth, so $f$ is differentiable. At points where $\\cos x=0$, i.e. $x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2},\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2},\\dots$, $\\lvert\\cos x\\rvert$ has a cusp and is not differentiable. More formally, near $x_0$ with $\\cos x_0=0$ and $\\sin x_0=\\pm1$, we have $\\lvert\\cos x\\rvert=\\lvert\\sin x_0\\rvert\\,\\lvert x-x_0\\rvert+o(\\lvert x-x_0\\rvert)$, so left and right derivatives differ in sign. Thus $\\lvert\\cos x\\rvert$ is not differentiable at $x=\\pi/2$ and $x=3\\pi/2$, and multiplying by smooth $e^{-x}$ cannot fix this; $f$ is not differentiable at those points. So A and C are false.\\n\\nAt $x=\\pi$, $\\cos\\pi=-1\\neq0$, so $\\lvert\\cos x\\rvert=-\\cos x$ in a neighborhood of $\\pi$, which is smooth. Product with $e^{-x}$ is differentiable there, so B is true. Hence the correct options are B and D."
