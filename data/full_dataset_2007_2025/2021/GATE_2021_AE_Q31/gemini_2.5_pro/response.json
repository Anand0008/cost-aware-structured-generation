        "reasoning": "The function $f(x) = e^{-x} |\\cos x|$ needs to be analyzed for continuity and differentiability at specific points. The critical points for differentiability of functions involving absolute values are where the argument of the absolute value becomes zero. In this case, $|\\cos x|$ changes its definition where $\\cos x = 0$, i.e., at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$. \n\n**1. Continuity Check:**\nBoth $e^{-x}$ and $|\\cos x|$ are continuous functions for all $x > 0$. The product of two continuous functions is always continuous. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous for all $x > 0$. This immediately confirms that Option D (Continuous at $x = 2\\pi$) is true, as $2\\pi$ is a point where $\\cos x = 1 \\neq 0$, and thus $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$ in a neighborhood of $2\\pi$, which is clearly continuous.\n\n**2. Differentiability Check:**\nA function $f(x)$ is differentiable at a point $x_0$ if the left-hand derivative (LHD) and right-hand derivative (RHD) exist and are equal at $x_0$. The derivative of $f(x) = e^{-x} |\\cos x|$ can be found using the product rule, but special care must be taken at points where $|\\cos x|$ changes its definition (i.e., where $\\cos x = 0$).\nLet $g(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$. Then $g'(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x - e^{-x} \\sin x = -e^{-x}(\\cos x + \\sin x)$.\n\n*   **Option A: Differentiable at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?**\n    At $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, so $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = e^{-\\pi/2} |0| = 0$.\n    For $x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (but $x > 0$), $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    For $x > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (but $x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    LHD at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}^-) = g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = -e^{-\\pi/2}$.\n    RHD at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}^+) = -g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -(-e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}))) = e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = e^{-\\pi/2}$.\n    Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD ($-e^{-\\pi/2} \\neq e^{-\\pi/2}$), $f(x)$ is NOT differentiable at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So, Option A is false.\n\n*   **Option B: Differentiable at $x = \\pi$?**\n    At $x = \\pi$, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1 \\neq 0$. In a neighborhood of $x = \\pi$, $\\cos x$ is negative. Therefore, $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$ for $x$ near $\\pi$. Since $-e^{-x} \\cos x$ is a product of elementary differentiable functions, $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = \\pi$. So, Option B is true.\n\n*   **Option C: Differentiable at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$?**\n    At $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0$, so $f(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = e^{-3\\pi/2} |0| = 0$.\n    For $x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ (but $x > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    For $x > \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ (but $x < \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    LHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^-) = -g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -(-e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}))) = e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}$.\n    RHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^+) = g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = e^{-3\\pi/2}$.\n    Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD ($-e^{-3\\pi/2} \\neq e^{-3\\pi/2}$), $f(x)$ is NOT differentiable at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. So, Option C is false.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are B and D."
