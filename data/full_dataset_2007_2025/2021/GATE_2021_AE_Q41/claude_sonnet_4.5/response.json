The key steps are:\n\n1. The induced angle of attack for an elliptic wing is given by $\\alpha_i = C_L / (\\pi \\cdot AR)$. With $C_L$ at 5 degrees angle of attack and $AR=10$, this evaluates to around 0.0159 radians or 0.91 degrees.\n\n2. The induced drag coefficient is then calculated as $C_{D,i} = C_L^2 / (\\pi \\cdot AR)$. Plugging in the lift coefficient and aspect ratio, this gives a $C_{D,i}$ between 0.005 and 0.009, which matches the provided correct answer range."
