          "Step 3: Determine the effective length factor ($K$) for each column based on its end conditions. For column BD (pinned-fixed), $K_{BD} = 0.7$. For column CE (pinned-pinned), $K_{CE} = 1.0$. Calculate the effective length ($L_e = K L$) for each column.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the Euler critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$) for each column using the formula $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L_e^2}$. These loads represent the maximum axial force each column can withstand before buckling.",
          "Step 5: For 'simultaneous buckling', the axial force in each column must be equal to its respective critical buckling load. So, $F_{BD} = P_{cr,BD}$ and $F_{CE} = P_{cr,CE}$.",
          "Step 6: Apply static equilibrium to the rigid horizontal bar ABC. Assume that at the point of simultaneous buckling, the roller support at A provides zero vertical reaction ($R_A = 0$). This simplifies the problem, making it statically determinate with respect to the forces in columns BD and CE.",
          "Step 7: Use the moment equilibrium equation about point B for the rigid bar: $\\Sigma M_B = 0$. This gives $P \\times a = F_{CE} \\times 100 \\text{ cm}$.",
