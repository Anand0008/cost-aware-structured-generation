Using the Euler buckling formula for pinned-pinned columns, $P_cr = \\pi^2 EI / L^2$, and the given cross-section and material properties, we can calculate the critical loads for each column. By setting the critical loads equal, we can solve for the distance 'a' where the loads are equal, which is the value in the range of 14.0 to 16.0 cm."
