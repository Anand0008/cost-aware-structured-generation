This probability is the ratio of the shaded area to the total area of the square.\n\n1.  **Define Geometry and Total Area:** Let the side length of the square PQRS be $a$. The area of the square is $A_{square} = a^2$.\n\n2.  **Identify Circular Sectors:** The shaded portion is formed by the intersection of two circular sectors:\n    *   **Sector 1 (centered at S):** This is a quarter circle with radius $a$ (arc PR). Its area is $A_{sector\\_S} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$.\n    *   **Sector 2 (centered at Q):** This is also a quarter circle with radius $a$ (arc PR). Its area is $A_{sector\\_Q} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Shaded Area ($A_{shaded}$):** The shaded area is the intersection of these two sectors. A common method for finding the intersection area of two overlapping shapes within a bounding box (the square, in this case) is to use a modified inclusion-exclusion principle. Let $A_{unshaded\\_P}$ be the unshaded region near corner P (outside the shaded area) and $A_{unshaded\\_R}$ be the unshaded region near corner R (outside the shaded area). By symmetry, $A_{unshaded\\_P} = A_{unshaded\\_R}$.\n    *   The area of Sector 1 ($A_{sector\\_S}$) covers the shaded area and the unshaded region near R: $A_{sector\\_S} = A_{shaded} + A_{unshaded\\_R}$.\n    *   The area of Sector 2 ($A_{sector\\_Q}$) covers the shaded area and the unshaded region near P: $A_{sector\\_Q} = A_{shaded} + A_{unshaded\\_P}$.\n    *   Summing these two equations: $A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} = 2 A_{shaded} + A_{unshaded\\_P} + A_{unshaded\\_R}$.\n    *   The total area of the square is composed of the shaded area and the two unshaded regions: $A_{square} = A_{shaded} + A_{unshaded\\_P} + A_{unshaded\\_R}$.\n    *   Substitute $A_{unshaded\\_P} + A_{unshaded\\_R} = A_{square} - A_{shaded}$ into the summed equation:\n        $A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} = 2 A_{shaded} + (A_{square} - A_{shaded})$\n        $A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} = A_{shaded} + A_{square}$\n    *   Rearranging to find the shaded area:\n        $A_{shaded} = A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} - A_{square}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values:**\n    $A_{shaded} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 - a^2$\n    $A_{shaded} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi a^2 - a^2$\n    $A_{shaded} = a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Probability:** The probability $P$ is the ratio of the shaded area to the square's area:\n    $P = \\frac{A_{shaded}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)}{a^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$.\n\nThis result matches option C."

          "**Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Identify Total Area.** The problem involves a square PQRS. Let its side length be $a$. The total area within which a point is picked is the area of the square, $A_{square} = a^2$.",
          "**Step 2: Identify the Contributing Shapes.** The shaded region is formed by the intersection of two circular sectors. One sector is centered at S with radius $a$ (covering the region SPR), and the other is centered at Q with radius $a$ (covering the region QRP). Both are quarter circles, as the angle at the corner of a square is $90^\\circ$ or $\\pi/2$ radians.",
          "**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Each Sector.** The area of a quarter circle with radius $r$ is $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2$. For this problem, $r=a$. So, the area of each sector is $A_{sector\\_S} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$ and $A_{sector\\_Q} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$.",
          "**Step 4: Determine the Shaded Area using Geometric Principle.** The shaded area is the intersection of the two sectors. For this specific configuration (two quarter circles overlapping within a square, with their union covering the entire square except for the two unshaded corners), the area of the intersection ($A_{shaded}$) can be found using the formula: $A_{shaded} = A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} - A_{square}$. This formula arises from the fact that when you sum the areas of the two sectors, the shaded (overlapping) region is counted twice, and the square's area is the sum of the shaded area and the two unshaded corner regions.",
          "**Step 5: Substitute and Calculate the Shaded Area.** Substitute the areas from Step 1 and Step 3 into the formula from Step 4: $A_{shaded} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 - a^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi a^2 - a^2 = a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)$.",
          "**Step 6: Calculate the Probability.** The probability that a randomly picked point falls in the shaded area is the ratio of the shaded area to the total area of the square: $P = \\frac{A_{shaded}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)}{a^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$.
