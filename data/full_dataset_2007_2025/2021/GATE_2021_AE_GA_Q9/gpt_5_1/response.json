        "reasoning": "Let the side of the square PQRS be $r$. Place the square with S at $(0,0)$, R at $(r,0)$, Q at $(r,r)$, and P at $(0,r)$. Two quarter-circles of radius $r$ are drawn: one centered at S, another at Q. Their equations are $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ (center S) and $(x - r)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2$ (center Q). The shaded region is the intersection of these two quarter-disks inside the square. The probability is the ratio of the intersection area to the square area $r^2$. It is easier to compute the complement: area inside the square but outside at least one of the quarter-circles. Each quarter-circle has area $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{4}$. The union of the two quarter-circles inside the square is a half-disk of radius $r$ (because the two quarter-circles are opposite quadrants of the same circle of radius $r$ whose center is at the square\\'s center). Thus the union area is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}$. By inclusion-exclusion, $A_1 + A_2 - A_{\\text{intersection}} = A_{\\text{union}}$, so $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4} - A_{\\text{intersection}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2} - A_{\\text{intersection}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}$, giving $A_{\\text{intersection}} = 0$. This shows the union reasoning above is incorrect: the two quarter-circles are not disjoint quadrants of the same circle. Instead, compute directly. The square\\'s center is at $(\\frac{r}{2}, \\frac{r}{2})$. The distance from this center to S is $\\sqrt{(\\frac{r}{2})^2 + (\\frac{r}{2})^2} = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}} < r$, so the square\\'s center lies inside both circles; hence the intersection is a lens-shaped region symmetric about the line $y = x$. A simpler method is to compute the area of one quarter-circle and subtract the two corner segments that are outside the other circle but inside the first. However, there is a standard result for this configuration: the intersection area of two circles of radius $r$ whose centers are separated by $r\\sqrt{2}$ and restricted to the square is $r^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1\\right)$. Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{A_{\\text{shaded}}}{A_{\\text{square}}} = \\dfrac{r^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1\\right)}{r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$, which matches option C."

          "Step 2: Inside the square, draw two quarter-circles of radius $r$: one centered at S (bottom-left corner) and one centered at Q (top-right corner). The shaded region is their intersection inside the square.",
          "Step 3: Observe that the full circles (if extended) both have radius $r$ and their centers S and Q are at opposite corners of the square. The distance between S and Q is the diagonal of the square, $d = r\\sqrt{2}$. Thus we have two equal circles of radius $r$ with center separation $d = r\\sqrt{2} < 2r$, so they intersect in a symmetric lens.",
          "Step 4: The intersection area of two equal circles of radius $r$ whose centers are separated by distance $d$ is given by $A_{\\cap} = 2r^2\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{d}{2r}\\right) - \\frac{d}{2}\\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}$. Substitute $d = r\\sqrt{2}$ to get $A_{\\cap} = 2r^2\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) - \\frac{r\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{4r^2 - 2r^2}$. ",
          "Step 5: Simplify: $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\sqrt{4r^2 - 2r^2} = \\sqrt{2}r$. Hence $A_{\\cap} = 2r^2\\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{r\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}r = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2} - r^2 = r^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1\\right)$. This lens lies entirely within the square and coincides with the intersection of the two quarter-disks there.",
          "Step 6: Therefore the shaded area is $A_{\\text{shaded}} = r^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1\\right)$.
