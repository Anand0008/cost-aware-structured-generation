With $\\gamma=1.4$, exponent is $0.2857$, so $T_{03f}=288\\times 1.6^{0.2857}\\approx 331.5\\,\\text{K}$. 3) For the cold (bypass) nozzle, stagnation pressure ratio is $P_{03f}/P_a=1.6<1.893$ (critical ratio for $\\gamma=1.4$), so the nozzle is unchoked and expands isentropically to $P_e=P_a$. Exit static temperature is $T_e=T_{03f}\\left(\\dfrac{P_e}{P_{03f}}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}=331.5\\times(1/1.6)^{0.2857}\\approx 294\\,\\text{K}$. 4) Ideal nozzle energy equation: $V_e=\\sqrt{2C_p(T_{03f}-T_e)}$.
