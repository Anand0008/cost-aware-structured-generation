    "question_text": "A twin-spool turbofan engine is operated at sea level (P_a = 1 bar, T_a = 288 K). The engine has separate cold and hot nozzles. During static thrust test at sea level, the overall mass flow rate of air through the engine and the cold exhaust temperature are measured to be 100 kg/s and 288 K, respectively. The parameters for the engine are:\nFan pressure ratio = 1.6\nOverall pressure ratio = 20\nBypass ratio = 3.0\nTurbine entry temperature = 1800 K.\nThe specific heat at constant pressure (C_p) is 1.005 kJ/kg-K and the ratio of specific heats (γ) is 1.4 for air.\nAssuming ideal fan and ideal expansion in the nozzle, the sea-level static thrust from the cold nozzle is _____________ kN (round off to two decimal places)."
