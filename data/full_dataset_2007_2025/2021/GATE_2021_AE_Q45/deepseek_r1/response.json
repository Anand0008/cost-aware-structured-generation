Step-by-step: Given overall mass flow rate m_dot_a = 100 kg/s and bypass ratio α = 3, cold mass flow rate m_dot_cold = α/(1+α) * m_dot_a = 75 kg/s. For sea-level static, intake stagnation conditions equal ambient: T02 = 288 K, P02 = 1 bar. Fan pressure ratio π_f = 1.6, so fan exit stagnation temperature T03_cold = T02 * (π_f)^((γ-1)/γ) ≈ 329.4 K. Given cold exhaust static temperature T_e_cold = 288 K, ideal expansion gives exit velocity U_e_cold = sqrt(2 * Cp * (T03_cold - T_e_cold)) ≈ 288.5 m/s. Thrust F_cold = m_dot_cold * U_e_cold ≈ 75 * 288.5 = 21637.5 N = 21.64 kN."

However, the specific parameters in the question (e.g., T04=1800K) were not in RAG, so internal knowledge was used for energy balance assumption that core stream doesn't affect cold nozzle thrust here."

During static thrust test at sea level, the overall mass flow rate of air through the engine and the cold exhaust temperature are measured to be 100 kg/s and 288 K, respectively. The parameters for the engine are:\nFan pressure ratio = 1.6\nOverall pressure ratio = 20\nBypass ratio = 3.0\nTurbine entry temperature = 1800 K.\nThe specific heat at constant pressure (C_p) is 1.005 kJ/kg-K and the ratio of specific heats (γ) is 1.4 for air.\nAssuming ideal fan and ideal expansion in the nozzle, the sea-level static thrust from the cold nozzle is _____________ kN (round off to two decimal places)."
