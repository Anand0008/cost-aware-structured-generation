        "reasoning": "Based on thin airfoil theory:\n1.  **Option A:** The lift coefficient ($c_l$) for a thin airfoil is given by $c_l = 2\\pi (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle of attack and $\\alpha_{L=0}$ is the zero-lift angle of attack. The term $(\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$ is often referred to as the absolute angle of attack. Thus, $c_l$ is directly proportional to the absolute angle of attack. The RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly states the universal lift slope $dc_l/d\\alpha = 2\\pi$ per radian for any thin airfoil, confirming this linear relationship.\n2.  **Option B:** The RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) consistently states that for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the aerodynamic center (AC) is located at the quarter-chord point ($c/4$). This is because the pitching moment coefficient about this point ($c_{m,ac}$) is constant and independent of the angle of attack.\n3.  **Option C:** The RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) clearly states that for a *cambered* airfoil, the center of pressure (CP) is *not* fixed at the quarter-chord point; it moves with the lift coefficient (and thus with the angle of attack). For a symmetric airfoil, it is at $c/4$, but not for a cambered one in general. As lift approaches zero, the CP moves towards infinity.\n4.  **Option D:** Thin airfoil theory is an inviscid theory and, by definition, predicts zero drag (d'Alembert's paradox). Therefore, it does not provide any relationship for the drag coefficient, let alone one proportional to the square of the lift coefficient. The relationship $C_D = C_{D,0} + K C_L^2$ is for finite wings (induced drag) or includes viscous effects (profile drag), which are beyond the scope of thin airfoil theory."

          "Step 1: Understand the scope of the question, which is 'thin airfoil theory' and specifically for a 'cambered airfoil'. This limits the applicable principles to inviscid, incompressible flow assumptions.",

Recall the fundamental equation for lift coefficient from thin airfoil theory: $c_l = a_0 (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$, where $a_0 = 2\\pi$. This shows a direct proportionality to the absolute angle of attack $(\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option B regarding the aerodynamic center (AC). Recall that for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the AC is theoretically located at the quarter-chord point ($c/4$) because the pitching moment about this point is constant with angle of attack. This is a key result of thin airfoil theory.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C regarding the center of pressure (CP). Remember that for a *cambered* airfoil, the CP is generally not fixed and moves with the angle of attack. It only coincides with the AC at a specific lift coefficient. For a symmetric airfoil, it is fixed at $c/4$.",
