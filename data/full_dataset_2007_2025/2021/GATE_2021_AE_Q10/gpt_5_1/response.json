        "reasoning": "In a uniaxial tension test, the applied normal stress acts along the axis of the specimen. On a plane normal to the loading direction (plane x-x), the stress is purely normal tensile stress. On a plane inclined at 45\\degree\\ (plane y-y in the figure), the resolved normal and shear stresses are both non-zero; at 45\\degree\\ the shear stress is maximized and equals half the axial stress, while the normal stress is also tensile but smaller than the axial stress. \nBrittle materials fail when the maximum principal (normal) tensile stress reaches their tensile strength (Rankine/maximum principal stress theory). The maximum principal stress occurs on the plane perpendicular to the loading direction, i.e., plane x-x. Hence brittle specimens crack across a section normal to the axis. \nDuctile materials, however, are governed by shear-yield criteria (Tresca or von Mises). They begin to yield and eventually fail along planes of maximum shear stress, which for uniaxial tension are at 45\\degree\\ to the loading axis. Therefore, failure in ductile materials initiates along the 45\\degree\\ plane y-y. \nThus, failure initiates along x-x in brittle material and along y-y in ductile material, matching option B."

Specific uniaxial stress transformation formulas were supplied from internal knowledge."
