        "reasoning": "In a uniaxial tension test, a pulling force is applied along the longitudinal axis of the specimen. We need to determine the planes where maximum normal (tensile) stress and maximum shear stress occur, and then relate these to the failure characteristics of brittle and ductile materials.\n\n1.  **Stress State in Uniaxial Tension:** When a material is subjected to uniaxial tension (say, along the horizontal axis as implied by the arrows in the figure):\n    *   The maximum normal (tensile) stress occurs on planes perpendicular to the loading axis. In the given figure, the `x-x` plane is shown as perpendicular to the horizontal loading direction.\n    *   The maximum shear stress occurs on planes oriented at 45 degrees to the loading axis. In the given figure, the `y-y` plane is shown at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal loading direction.\n\n2.  **Failure of Brittle Materials:** Brittle materials (e.g., cast iron, ceramics) are inherently weak in tension and tend to fail by fracture when the maximum principal tensile stress reaches their ultimate tensile strength (as per Rankine's Maximum Principal Stress Theory, Chunk 2). Therefore, a brittle material under uniaxial tension will fail along the plane where the maximum normal tensile stress is acting, which is the `x-x` plane.\n\n3.  **Failure of Ductile Materials:** Ductile materials (e.g., mild steel, aluminum) are generally weaker in shear than in tension/compression. They tend to fail by yielding (plastic deformation) and then fracture when the maximum shear stress reaches their shear yield strength (Chunk 1, 4, 5). Therefore, a ductile material under uniaxial tension will fail along the plane where the maximum shear stress is acting, which is the `y-y` plane.\n\nCombining these points, failure would initiate along `x-x` in brittle material and along `y-y` in ductile material, which corresponds to option B."

For a uniaxial tensile stress `$\\sigma$`, the maximum normal stress is `$\\sigma$` itself, occurring on planes perpendicular to the loading axis. The maximum shear stress is `$\\sigma/2$`, occurring on planes oriented at 45 degrees to the loading axis.",
          "Step 3: Relate these planes to the figure. The `x-x` plane is shown perpendicular to the horizontal loading direction, thus it is the plane of maximum normal stress. The `y-y` plane is shown at 45 degrees to the horizontal loading direction, thus it is the plane of maximum shear stress.",
          "Step 4: Recall the failure characteristics of brittle materials. Brittle materials are weak in tension and fail by fracturing along planes subjected to maximum normal (tensile) stress (Chunk 2, 3).",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent context on the failure mechanisms of brittle and ductile materials, particularly highlighting their weakness in tension vs. shear. While some chunks focused on torsional loading, the underlying principles of material behavior (brittle = weak in tension, ductile = weak in shear) are universally applicable and directly helped answer this uniaxial tension problem. The definitions of brittle/ductile and theories of failure were also very helpful."
