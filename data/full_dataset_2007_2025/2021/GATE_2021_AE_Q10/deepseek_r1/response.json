If the tensile load is applied horizontally (perpendicular to x-x), then x-x represents a vertical plane. Brittle materials fail on the plane perpendicular to the maximum tensile stress. Since the load is horizontal, the maximum tensile stress is horizontal, so the failure plane is vertical, i.e., along x-x. Ductile materials fail due to shear, with maximum shear stress on planes at 45° to the load. However, in ductile materials, necking leads to triaxial stress, and failure often initiates internally along the specimen axis (horizontal). If y-y is the horizontal axis, then ductile failure initiates along y-y. This interpretation yields option B: brittle along x-x, ductile along y-y."
