          "Step 1: Identify the indeterminate form. As `x \\to 0`, `$\\frac{1}{\\sin x} \\to \\infty$` and `$\\frac{1}{x} \\to \\infty$`. Thus, the expression is of the `$\\infty - \\infty$` indeterminate form.",
          "Step 2: Convert the `$\\infty - \\infty$` form into a `$\\frac{0}{0}$` or `$\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$` form by combining the fractions. `$\\frac{1}{\\sin x} - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x - \\sin x}{x \\sin x}$`.",
          "Step 3: Re-evaluate the limit for the new expression. As `x \\to 0`, the numerator `$(x - \\sin x) \\to (0 - 0) = 0$` and the denominator `$(x \\sin x) \\to (0 \\cdot 0) = 0$`. This is a `$\\frac{0}{0}$` indeterminate form, so L'Hopital's Rule can be applied.",
          "Step 4: Apply L'Hopital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and the denominator with respect to `x`. \\ `$\\frac{d}{dx}(x - \\sin x) = 1 - \\cos x$` \\ `$\\frac{d}{dx}(x \\sin x) = 1 \\cdot \\sin x + x \\cdot \\cos x = \\sin x + x \\cos x$` \\ The limit becomes `$\\lim_{x\\to0} \\frac{1 - \\cos x}{\\sin x + x \\cos x}$`.",
          "Step 5: Re-evaluate the limit after the first application of L'Hopital's Rule. As `x \\to 0`, the new numerator `$(1 - \\cos x) \\to (1 - 1) = 0$` and the new denominator `$(\\sin x + x \\cos x) \\to (0 + 0 \\cdot 1) = 0$`. This is still a `$\\frac{0}{0}$` indeterminate form, so L'Hopital's Rule must be applied again.",
          "Step 6: Apply L'Hopital's Rule a second time. \\ `$\\frac{d}{dx}(1 - \\cos x) = 0 - (-\\sin x) = \\sin x$` \\ `$\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin x + x \\cos x) = \\cos x + (1 \\cdot \\cos x + x \\cdot (-\\sin x)) = \\cos x + \\cos x - x \\sin x = 2 \\cos x - x \\sin x$` \\ The limit becomes `$\\lim_{x\\to0} \\frac{\\sin x}{2 \\cos x - x \\sin x}$`.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate the final limit. Substitute `x = 0` into the expression: \\ `$\\frac{\\sin 0}{2 \\cos 0 - 0 \\cdot \\sin 0} = \\frac{0}{2 \\cdot 1 - 0} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$`.",

Other chunks were less directly relevant but covered related topics within limits and differentiation."
