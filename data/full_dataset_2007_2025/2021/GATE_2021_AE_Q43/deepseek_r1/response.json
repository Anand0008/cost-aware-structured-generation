        "notes": "RAG chunks (3, 4, 5) provided relevant background on fuel-air ratio calculation and combustor energy balance, which are key components of the overall energy balance. However, none of the chunks explicitly cover the overall engine energy balance with heat loss, nor the inclusion of kinetic energy terms. Thus, internal knowledge was primarily used to construct the solution, with RAG providing supportive context on fuel-air ratio."

The enthalpy of the incoming air at the intake is 260 kJ/kg and the enthalpy of the exhaust gases at the nozzle exit is 912 kJ/kg. The ratio of mass flow rates of fuel and air is equal to 0.019. The chemical energy (heating value) of fuel is 44.5 MJ/kg and the combustion process is ideal. The total loss of heat from the engine to the ambient is 25 kJ per kg of air. The velocity of the exhaust jet is __________m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
