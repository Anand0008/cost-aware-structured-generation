However, the critical overall engine Steady Flow Energy Equation, which is the direct method to solve this problem, was not explicitly provided in the RAG context. Therefore, the core formula application relied on internal knowledge, supplemented by RAG for contextual definitions."

The enthalpy of the incoming air at the intake is 260 kJ/kg and the enthalpy of the exhaust gases at the nozzle exit is 912 kJ/kg. The ratio of mass flow rates of fuel and air is equal to 0.019. The chemical energy (heating value) of fuel is 44.5 MJ/kg and the combustion process is ideal. The total loss of heat from the engine to the ambient is 25 kJ per kg of air. The velocity of the exhaust jet is __________m/s (round off to two decimal places)."
