        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the maximum thrust developed by the engine at sea level, given the maximum speed of the aircraft in steady and level flight. In steady, level flight, thrust available (T) must equal drag (D). At the maximum speed, the thrust available is at its maximum, and it balances the drag required at that speed. Therefore, the maximum thrust is equal to the drag experienced by the aircraft at its maximum speed.\n\n1.  **Calculate Weight (W):** $W = m \\times g = 10,000 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 100,000 \\text{ N}$.\n2.  **Calculate Aspect Ratio (AR):** For an elliptic wing, $AR = \\frac{b^2}{S} = \\frac{(10 \\text{ m})^2}{30 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{100}{30} = 3.333$.\n3.  **Calculate Dynamic Pressure ($q_{\\infty}$):** $q_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (100 \\text{ m/s})^2 = 6125 \\text{ N/m}^2$.\n4.  **Calculate Lift Coefficient ($C_L$):** In steady, level flight, Lift (L) = Weight (W). $C_L = \\frac{L}{q_{\\infty} S} = \\frac{100,000 \\text{ N}}{6125 \\text{ N/m}^2 \\times 30 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{100,000}{183,750} \\approx 0.5442$.\n5.  **Calculate Induced Drag Coefficient ($C_{Di}$):** For an elliptic wing, the Oswald efficiency factor ($e$) is 1. $C_{Di} = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR} = \\frac{(0.5442)^2}{\\pi \\times 1 \\times 3.333} = \\frac{0.29615}{10.4706} \\approx 0.02828$.\n6.  **Calculate Total Drag Coefficient ($C_D$):** $C_D = C_{D0} + C_{Di} = 0.025 + 0.02828 = 0.05328$.\n7.  **Calculate Total Drag (D):** $D = q_{\\infty} S C_D = 6125 \\text{ N/m}^2 \\times 30 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 0.05328 \\approx 9790.2 \\text{ N}$.\n8.  **Determine Maximum Thrust ($T_{max}$):** Since $T_{max} = D$ at maximum speed in steady, level flight, $T_{max} \\approx 9790.2 \\text{ N}$.\n\nThis value falls within the specified range of 9787 to 9795 N."
