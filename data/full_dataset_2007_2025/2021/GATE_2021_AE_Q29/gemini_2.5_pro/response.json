The light rays, after passing through the non-uniform density field in the test section, are shown to converge and diverge, creating distinct 'Lighter area' and 'Brighter area' on the screen. This phenomenon, where variations in light intensity on a screen are caused by the displacement of light rays due to density gradients, is characteristic of the Shadowgraph technique. Key distinguishing features from other techniques are the direct projection onto the screen and the absence of a knife edge or a complex interferometric setup. The Shadowgraph technique is sensitive to the second spatial derivative of density, making it ideal for visualizing abrupt changes like strong shock waves, which cause significant light ray displacement."
