          "Step 2: Analyze Statement A: Vertical fin effect on lateral stability. In a positive sideslip ($\\beta > 0$), a vertical fin above CG produces a side force to the right. This force, acting above CG, creates a rolling moment $L = -z \\cdot Y$, where $z$ is positive (above CG) and $Y$ is positive (force right). Thus $L$ is negative (left wing down), contributing to negative $C_{l_\\beta}$, which is stabilizing for lateral stability. Hence, true.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement B: Vertical fin effect on directional stability. For positive $\\beta$, the vertical fin generates a side force aft of CG, producing a yawing moment that reduces $\\beta$ (weathercock effect). This gives positive $C_{n_\\beta}$, which is stabilizing. Thus, the statement says 'destabilizing,' which is false.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement C: Wing anhedral effect on lateral stability. Dihedral (upward wing angle) increases lateral stability by making $C_{l_\\beta}$ more negative. Anhedral (downward angle) reduces this effect, making $C_{l_\\beta}$ less negative or even positive, decreasing lateral stability. Hence, false.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Statement D: Horizontal tail effect on longitudinal stability. The horizontal tail, located aft of CG, produces a negative pitching moment increment with increasing angle of attack ($\\alpha$), ensuring $C_{m_{\\alpha}} < 0$, which is stabilizing. Hence, true.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided highly relevant content on directional, lateral, and longitudinal stability definitions, conditions, and component contributions. Chunks 1-5 directly support the analysis. Chunk 6 (bi-tail) was less directly relevant but provided insight into vertical tail's rolling moment contribution. No critical information missing; internal knowledge supplemented sign conventions and anhedral effect."
