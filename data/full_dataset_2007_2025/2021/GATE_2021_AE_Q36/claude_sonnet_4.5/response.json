Based on the information provided in the RAG context, the following statements are true:\n\nA. The vertical fin has a stabilizing effect on the lateral (directional) stability of the aircraft. The RAG explains that the vertical tail generates a side force when subjected to a sideslip, which creates a yawing moment that tends to reduce the sideslip, providing directional stability (CN_beta > 0).\n\nD. The horizontal tail has a stabilizing effect on the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft. The RAG explains that the horizontal tail, positioned aft of the center of gravity, generates a stabilizing (nose-down) pitching moment when the angle of attack increases, which counteracts the destabilizing effect of the wing, providing longitudinal static stability."
