The hot gases are expanded ideally to the ambient pressure of 0.1 MPa in a convergent-divergent nozzle having a throat area of 0.1 m². The molecular mass of the gas is 22 kg/kmol. The ratio of specific heats (γ) of the gas is 1.32. The value of the universal gas constant (R₀) is 8314 J/kmol-K. The acceleration due to gravity, g, is 9.8 m/s². The specific impulse of the rocket is _______ seconds (round off to two decimal places)."
