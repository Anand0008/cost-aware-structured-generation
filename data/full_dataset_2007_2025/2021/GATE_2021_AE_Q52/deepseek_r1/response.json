    "question_text": "A 3 m x 1 m signboard is supported by a vertical hollow pole that is fixed to the ground. The pole has a square cross section with outer dimension 250 mm. The yield strength of the pole material is 240 MPa. To sustain a wind pressure of 7.5 kPa, the dimension d of the pole is _________ mm (round off to nearest integer). (Neglect the effect of transverse shear and load due to wind pressure acting on the pole)"
