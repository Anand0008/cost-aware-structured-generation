        "reasoning": "The problem involves determining the inner dimension 'd' of a hollow square pole supporting a signboard subjected to wind pressure. The pole is fixed to the ground, making it a cantilever. The wind pressure on the signboard creates a resultant force, which, due to the signboard's position relative to the pole, induces a bending moment at the base of the pole. The problem explicitly states to neglect transverse shear and wind pressure on the pole itself. Given that the signboard is symmetrically supported by the pole (as depicted in the image), a uniform wind pressure will not generate a torsional moment about the pole's vertical axis. Therefore, the pole is primarily subjected to bending. The design criterion is that the maximum normal stress due to bending must not exceed the yield strength of the pole material.\n\n1.  **Calculate Wind Force (P):**\n    `P = q \\times A_{signboard} = 7.5 \\text{ kPa} \\times (3 \\text{ m} \\times 1 \\text{ m}) = 7.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}^2 \\times 3 \\text{ m}^2 = 22.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}`\n\n2.  **Calculate Bending Moment (M) at the base:**\n    The force `P` acts at the center of the signboard. The vertical distance from the center of the signboard to the base of the pole (`L_b`) is the pole length plus half the signboard height.\n    `L_b = 5.5 \\text{ m} + (1 \\text{ m} / 2) = 6.0 \\text{ m}`\n    `M = P \\times L_b = 22.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N} \\times 6.0 \\text{ m} = 135 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Nm}`\n\n3.  **Apply Bending Stress Formula:**\n    The maximum bending stress `$\\sigma_{max}$` occurs at the outermost fibers of the pole's cross-section at the base. This stress must be less than or equal to the yield strength `$\\sigma_y$`.\n    `$\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M c}{I}$`\n    Where:\n    *   `$\\sigma_y = 240 \\text{ MPa} = 240 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2$`\n    *   `$D_o = 250 \\text{ mm} = 0.250 \\text{ m}$` (outer dimension of the square pole)\n    *   `$c = D_o / 2 = 0.250 \\text{ m} / 2 = 0.125 \\text{ m}$` (distance from neutral axis to outer fiber)\n    *   `$I = \\frac{D_o^4 - d^4}{12}$` (area moment of inertia for a hollow square section)\n\n4.  **Solve for 'd':**\n    `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{M c}{I}$`\n    `$240 \\times 10^6 = \\frac{135 \\times 10^3 \\times 0.125}{\\frac{(0.250)^4 - d^4}{12}}$`\n    `$240 \\times 10^6 = \\frac{135 \\times 10^3 \\times 0.125 \\times 12}{(0.250)^4 - d^4}$`\n    `$240 \\times 10^6 = \\frac{202.5 \\times 10^3}{(0.250)^4 - d^4}$`\n    `(0.250)^4 - d^4 = \\frac{202.5 \\times 10^3}{240 \\times 10^6}$`\n    `$0.00390625 - d^4 = 0.00084375$`\n    `$d^4 = 0.00390625 - 0.00084375$`\n    `$d^4 = 0.0030625$`\n    `$d = (0.0030625)^{1/4}$`\n    `$d \\approx 0.235109 \\text{ m}$`\n    `$d \\approx 235.109 \\text{ mm}$`\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, `d = 235 mm`.

They provided direct guidance on calculating forces and moments from wind pressure on signboards, the general approach to combined stresses (bending, torsion, shear), and the fundamental formulas for bending stress and design based on allowable stress. Although the problem ultimately simplified to pure bending (no torsion), the RAG context helped in understanding the potential for combined loading and the general methodology. Chunks 3 and 6 were generally relevant for hollow sections and torsion but not directly used in the final calculation due to the problem's specific conditions."
