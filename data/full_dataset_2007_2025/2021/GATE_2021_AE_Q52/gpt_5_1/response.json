        "reasoning": "Wind pressure on the 3 m × 1 m signboard gives a resultant horizontal force P = qA = 7.5 kPa × 3 m × 1 m = 22.5 kN acting at the centroid of the board. The centroid is 0.5 m above the bottom of the board, and the bottom is 5.5 m above the fixed base, so the lever arm from the base to the line of action is 5.5 + 0.5 = 6.0 m. Hence the bending moment at the base is M = P L = 22.5 kN × 6 m = 135 kN·m. The pole is a hollow square with outer side 250 mm and inner side d. Neglecting shear, the maximum bending stress at the outer fiber must not exceed the yield strength 240 MPa. For a square of side a, the second moment of area about a centroidal axis is I = a^4 / 12. For a hollow square, I = (a_o^4 − a_i^4)/12. The section modulus is Z = I / (a_o/2) = (a_o^4 − a_i^4)/(6 a_o). Setting σ = M / Z ≤ σ_y and solving for a_i gives:\nσ_y = M / Z = 6 M a_o / (a_o^4 − a_i^4).\nRearranging: a_i^4 = a_o^4 − 6 M a_o / σ_y.\nUsing a_o = 0.25 m, M = 135×10^3 N·m, σ_y = 240×10^6 N/m²:\na_o^4 = (0.25)^4 = 0.00390625 m⁴.\n6 M a_o / σ_y = 6 × 135000 × 0.25 / 240×10^6 = 0.00084375 m⁴.\nThus a_i^4 = 0.00390625 − 0.00084375 = 0.0030625 m⁴.\nTaking the fourth root: a_i = (0.0030625)^{1/4} ≈ 0.236 m = 236 mm. This lies within the official answer range 232–238 mm, confirming the key."

        "notes": "RAG chunks discussed combined stresses, torsion, and bending in signposts and poles, including wind load conversion to equivalent forces and moments, which is conceptually similar. However, they focused more on circular sections and combined torsion-bending, while this question uses a hollow square and only bending. Core formulas for torsion were not needed here, but the examples helped confirm the modeling of wind load as a resultant force and moment."

(Neglect the effect of transverse shear and load due to wind pressure acting on the pole)"
