The mass flow rate is \\(\\dot{m} = \\rho A V = 1000 \\times (\\pi (0.025)^2) \\times 10 \\approx 19.63\\,\\text{kg/s}\\). Horizontal momentum flux in equals \\(\\dot{m} V_{x,in} = \\dot{m} (10)\\).

    "question_text": "A large water tank is fixed on a cart with wheels and a vane (see figure). The wheels of the cart provide negligible resistance for rolling on the fixed support. The cart is tied to the fixed support with a thin horizontal rope. There is a hole of diameter 5 cm on the side of the tank through which a jet of constant velocity of 10 m/s emerges. The jet of water is deflected by the attached vane by 60° (see figure). Assume that the jet velocity remains constant at 10 m/s after emerging from the vane. Take density of water to be 1000 kg/m³. The tension in the connecting rope is _____ N (round off to one decimal place)."
