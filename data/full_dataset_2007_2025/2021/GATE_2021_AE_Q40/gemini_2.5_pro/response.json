        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the tension in a rope that holds a cart stationary against the force exerted by a deflected water jet. This requires applying the linear momentum equation to a control volume encompassing the jet and the vane. The force exerted by the fluid on the vane in the horizontal direction must be balanced by the rope tension.\n\n1.  **Calculate the cross-sectional area of the jet:**\n    The diameter $D = 5$ cm $= 0.05$ m.\n    $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.05 \\text{ m})^2}{4} = 0.001963495 \\text{ m}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mass flow rate of the water jet:**\n    Density $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$.\n    Jet velocity $V = 10$ m/s.\n    $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.001963495 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 10 \\text{ m/s} = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s}$\n\n3.  **Determine the initial and final velocity components of the jet:**\n    The jet emerges horizontally, so the initial velocity vector is $\\vec{V}_{in} = (V_{in,x}, V_{in,y}) = (10, 0)$ m/s.\n    The jet is deflected by $60^\\circ$ upwards from the horizontal, and its magnitude remains $10$ m/s. So, the final velocity vector is:\n    $V_{out,x} = V \\cos(60^\\circ) = 10 \\times 0.5 = 5$ m/s\n    $V_{out,y} = V \\sin(60^\\circ) = 10 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{3}$ m/s\n    Thus, $\\vec{V}_{out} = (5, 5\\sqrt{3})$ m/s.\n\n4.  **Apply the linear momentum equation in the x-direction to find the force exerted by the fluid on the vane ($F_x$):**\n    The force exerted by the fluid on the vane is given by:\n    $F_x = \\dot{m}(V_{in,x} - V_{out,x})$\n    $F_x = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s} \\times (10 \\text{ m/s} - 5 \\text{ m/s})$\n    $F_x = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 5 \\text{ m/s} = 98.17475 \\text{ N}$\n\n5.  **Determine the tension in the rope:**\n    Since the cart is stationary, the net horizontal force on the cart-vane system must be zero. The force $F_x$ acts to the right (positive x-direction). The tension in the rope ($T$) acts to the left, balancing this force.\n    $T = F_x = 98.17475 \\text{ N}$\n\n6.  **Round off to one decimal place:**\n    $T \\approx 98.2 \\text{ N}$\n\nThis value falls within the specified range of 98.0 to 98.5 N."

        "notes": "RAG chunk 1 (Sutton-Biblarz) provided a relevant example of jet impingement force and the general principle of momentum change ($F = \\dot{m} \\Delta V$). While the example was for a simpler perpendicular impact, the core concept was applicable. Other RAG chunks were not directly relevant to this specific fluid mechanics problem. The exact vector form for deflected jets was not explicitly provided in the RAG context, requiring reliance on internal knowledge for the full solution."

    "question_text": "A large water tank is fixed on a cart with wheels and a vane (see figure). The wheels of the cart provide negligible resistance for rolling on the fixed support. The cart is tied to the fixed support with a thin horizontal rope. There is a hole of diameter 5 cm on the side of the tank through which a jet of constant velocity of 10 m/s emerges. The jet of water is deflected by the attached vane by 60° (see figure). Assume that the jet velocity remains constant at 10 m/s after emerging from the vane. Take density of water to be 1000 kg/m³. The tension in the connecting rope is _____ N (round off to one decimal place)."
