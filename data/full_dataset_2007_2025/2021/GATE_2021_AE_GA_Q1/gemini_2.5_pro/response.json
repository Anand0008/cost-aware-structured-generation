The subject \"Arun and Aparna\" is a compound subject, which is plural, and it correctly uses the plural verb \"are\".\nSentence (ii) \"Arun and Aparna is here.\" is grammatically incorrect. The plural compound subject \"Arun and Aparna\" requires a plural verb, but \"is\" is singular.\nSentence (iii) \"Arun’s families is here.\" is grammatically incorrect. The subject \"Arun’s families\" is plural (referring to multiple families), but it uses the singular verb \"is\". It should be \"Arun's families are here.\"\nSentence (iv) \"Arun’s family is here.\" is grammatically correct. \"Family\" is a singular collective noun acting as a single unit, and it correctly uses the singular verb \"is\".\nTherefore, sentences (i) and (iv) are grammatically correct, making option B the correct answer."

          "Step 2: Analyze sentence (ii) \"Arun and Aparna is here.\" The subject is again \"Arun and Aparna\", which is plural. The verb is \"is\", which is a singular verb. This constitutes a subject-verb agreement error. Hence, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.",
          "Step 3: Analyze sentence (iii) \"Arun’s families is here.\" The subject is \"Arun’s families\". The noun \"families\" is plural. The verb is \"is\", which is singular. This is a subject-verb agreement error. Hence, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.",
          "Step 4: Analyze sentence (iv) \"Arun’s family is here.\" The subject is \"Arun’s family\". \"Family\" is a collective noun. When a collective noun refers to the group as a single unit, it takes a singular verb. The verb is \"is\", which is singular. The subject-verb agreement is correct.",
