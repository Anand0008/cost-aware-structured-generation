This is because C_mα is directly related to the static longitudinal stability, and a more negative C_mα results in a higher natural frequency for the short period oscillation.\nC. The primary contribution towards C_lp (rolling moment due to roll rate) is from the aircraft wing. The wing's contribution to roll damping is typically much larger than the tail's contribution.\nD. Increasing the size of the vertical fin leads to a higher yaw damping. A larger vertical fin generates more yawing moment in response to a yaw rate, thus increasing the yaw damping derivative C_nr."
