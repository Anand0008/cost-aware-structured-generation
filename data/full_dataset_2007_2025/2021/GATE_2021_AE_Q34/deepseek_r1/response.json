A more negative Cmα increases the natural frequency (ω_n_SP). (B) Cmq is the pitch damping derivative; a more negative Cmq increases the damping ratio (ζ_SP), improving damping. Therefore, this statement is false. (C) The primary aerodynamic surface contributing to roll damping derivative Clp is the wing, as its spanwise lift distribution changes with roll rate. (D) Yaw damping derivative Cnr is primarily increased by a larger vertical tail area, as it provides a larger stabilizing moment due to yaw rate."

          "Step 1: Identify the key stability derivatives and their roles. Cmα (pitching moment derivative w.r.t α) affects static longitudinal stability and short period frequency. Cmq (pitch damping derivative) affects short period damping. Clp (roll damping derivative) primarily comes from the wing. Cnr (yaw damping derivative) is influenced by the vertical tail.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Statement A. The short period natural frequency squared (ω_n_SP²) is proportional to -Cmα (from the characteristic equation). A more negative Cmα increases ω_n_SP², hence frequency increases. RAG Chunk 4 and 6 support this.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement B. The damping ratio ζ_SP is approximately proportional to -Cmq. A more negative Cmq increases ζ_SP, leading to higher damping, not decreased. RAG Chunk 1, 2, and 6 clarify that Cmq is negative for damping. Thus, statement B is false.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement C. Roll damping (Clp) arises because during a roll, wings experience differential changes in local angle of attack, creating an opposing rolling moment. The wing is the dominant contributor due to its large span and lift distribution. The tail contribution is secondary. This is standard knowledge.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Statement D. Yaw damping (Cnr) is primarily provided by the vertical tail. A larger vertical fin (increased area and moment arm) increases the yaw damping derivative, making the Dutch roll mode better damped. This is a fundamental design principle.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that statements A, C, and D are true."
