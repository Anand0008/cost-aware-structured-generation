        "reasoning": "Option A: Short-period natural frequency depends primarily on the stiffness term related to pitching moment derivative with respect to angle of attack, C_{m\\alpha}. From short-period characteristic equation (see RAG chunk 6), the natural frequency squared is approximately proportional to \\(-M_\\alpha\\) (or equivalently \\(-C_{m\\alpha}\\)). For a statically stable aircraft, C_{m\\alpha} is negative. Making C_{m\\alpha} more negative (larger magnitude) increases \\(-C_{m\\alpha}\\), thus increasing the short-period natural frequency. So A is true.\nOption B: Damping of the short-period mode is strongly influenced by the pitch damping derivative C_{mq} (RAG chunks 1, 2, 5, 6). A more negative C_{mq} provides a stronger nose-down moment opposing pitch rate, i.e., more damping. Therefore, making C_{mq} more negative increases damping, not decreases it. So B is false.\nOption C: C_{lp} is the rolling moment derivative with respect to roll rate p (roll damping derivative). For a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, roll damping is dominated by the finite-span wing: as the aircraft rolls, one wing moves up with reduced effective angle of attack and the other moves down with increased effective angle of attack, producing a restoring rolling moment. Contributions from fuselage and tail are much smaller. Hence the primary contribution to C_{lp} is from the wing. So C is true.\nOption D: Yaw damping is characterized by C_{nr}, the yawing moment derivative with respect to yaw rate r. Increasing vertical tail (fin) area and moment arm increases the side force generated during yaw, which produces a restoring yawing moment opposing the yaw rate, i.e., higher yaw damping (more negative C_{nr}). Thus increasing fin size leads to higher yaw damping. So D is true.\nTherefore, the correct set of true statements is A, C, and D, matching the official key."
