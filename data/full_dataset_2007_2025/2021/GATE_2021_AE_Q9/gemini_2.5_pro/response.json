        "reasoning": "The question asks for the shape of a supersonic diffuser that slows down a supersonic flow to subsonic flow. This involves understanding the area-velocity relation for compressible flow:\n\n1.  **Supersonic Deceleration (M > 1):** For supersonic flow, to decelerate (decrease velocity, `dV < 0`), the area-velocity relation `dA/A = (M^2 - 1) * dV/V` implies that since `(M^2 - 1)` is positive, `dA` must be negative. Therefore, a **converging** duct is required to decelerate supersonic flow. (Referenced in CHUNK 2, 3, 4)\n\n2.  **Transition to Sonic (M = 1):** To transition from supersonic to subsonic flow, the flow must pass through sonic conditions (`M=1`). According to the area-velocity relation, `M=1` can only occur at a point where `dA = 0`, which is a **throat** (minimum area). (Referenced in CHUNK 2, 4)\n\n3.  **Subsonic Deceleration (M < 1):** After passing through the throat, the flow becomes subsonic. To further decelerate subsonic flow (`M < 1`, `dV < 0`), the area-velocity relation `dA/A = (M^2 - 1) * dV/V` implies that since `(M^2 - 1)` is negative, `dA` must be positive. Therefore, a **diverging** duct is required to decelerate subsonic flow. (Referenced in CHUNK 2, 3, 4)\n\nCombining these requirements, a supersonic diffuser that slows down supersonic flow to subsonic flow must first converge to decelerate the supersonic flow, pass through a throat at sonic conditions, and then diverge to further decelerate the subsonic flow. This geometry is known as a **converging–diverging** duct."

          "Step 3: Analyze the initial section for supersonic deceleration. For supersonic flow (`M > 1`), `(M^2 - 1)` is positive. To decelerate the flow (`du < 0`), `dA` must be negative. This means the initial section of the diffuser must be **converging**.",
          "Step 4: Consider the transition from supersonic to subsonic. For the flow to transition from supersonic to subsonic, it must pass through sonic conditions (`M = 1`). At `M = 1`, the area-velocity relation implies `dA = 0` for a finite `du`. This point of minimum area is called a **throat**.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the final section for subsonic deceleration. After passing through the throat, the flow becomes subsonic (`M < 1`). For subsonic flow, `(M^2 - 1)` is negative. To decelerate the flow (`du < 0`), `dA` must be positive. This means the final section of the diffuser must be **diverging**.",
          "Step 6: Combine the sections. Based on the analysis, a supersonic diffuser that slows down supersonic flow to subsonic flow requires a **converging** section, followed by a **throat**, and then a **diverging** section. This overall shape is a **converging–diverging** duct."
