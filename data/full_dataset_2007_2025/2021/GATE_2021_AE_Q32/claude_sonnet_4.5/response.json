This is because the given mode shape for the first natural frequency is φ₁ = [1, -3.16]ᵀ, which matches the initial deflection ratio of 2:-6.32 (or 1:-3.16).\n\nOption C is also correct because an initial deflection of x₁(0) = 2 cm and x₂(0) = -2 cm would make the system oscillate with a linear combination of the first and second natural frequencies. This is because the initial deflection does not match the mode shapes, and thus the response will be a superposition of the two modes.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because the initial deflections do not match the mode shapes in a way that would excite only the second or first natural frequency, respectively."
