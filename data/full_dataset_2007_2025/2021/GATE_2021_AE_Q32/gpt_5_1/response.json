With zero initial velocities, the initial displacement vector must lie exactly along a single mode shape to excite only that mode. Mode shapes are given as $\\phi_1=[1,-3.16]^T$ and $\\phi_2=[1,3.16]^T$ (any scalar multiple is the same mode). \n\nCheck each option (convert cm to a vector, but scaling is irrelevant so we can compare ratios):\n\nMode 1 direction: $[1,-3.16]$. Any pure-mode-1 initial displacement must satisfy $x_2/x_1=-3.16$.\nMode 2 direction: $[1,3.16]$. Any pure-mode-2 initial displacement must satisfy $x_2/x_1=3.16$.\n\nA) $x_1=6.32$, $x_2=-3.16$. Ratio $x_2/x_1=-3.16/6.32\\approx-0.5$, not $3.16$. So it is not along mode 2; both modes will be excited. Hence A is false.\n\nB) $x_1=2$, $x_2=-6.32$. Ratio $x_2/x_1=-6.32/2=-3.16$, exactly the ratio of mode 1. So this initial displacement is a scalar multiple of $\\phi_1$ and excites only the first natural frequency. B is true.\n\nC) $x_1=2$, $x_2=-2$. Ratio $x_2/x_1=-1$, which is neither $-3.16$ nor $3.16$. Therefore the initial displacement is a linear combination of $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, and both natural frequencies will appear. C is true.\n\nD) $x_1=1$, $x_2=-6.32$. Ratio $x_2/x_1=-6.32$, not $-3.16$, so it is not a pure mode-1 shape; both modes will be excited. D is false.\n\nThus the official key B,C is consistent with modal superposition theory."
