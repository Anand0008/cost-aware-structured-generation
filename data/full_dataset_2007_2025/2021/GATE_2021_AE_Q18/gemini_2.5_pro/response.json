        "reasoning": "The integral $\\oint_ζ \\frac{z^3}{4z - i} dz$ is evaluated using Cauchy's Residue Theorem. The integrand $f(z) = \\frac{z^3}{4z - i}$ has a simple pole where the denominator is zero, i.e., $4z - i = 0 \\implies z_0 = \\frac{i}{4}$. The contour $ζ$ is the unit circle, meaning $|z|=1$. The modulus of the pole is $|z_0| = |\\frac{i}{4}| = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since $\\frac{1}{4} < 1$, the pole lies inside the contour. The residue at this simple pole is calculated as $\\text{Res}(f, z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)$. Substituting $f(z) = \\frac{z^3}{4(z - i/4)}$, we get $\\text{Res}(f, \\frac{i}{4}) = \\lim_{z \\to i/4} (z - \\frac{i}{4}) \\frac{z^3}{4(z - \\frac{i}{4})} = \\lim_{z \\to i/4} \\frac{z^3}{4} = \\frac{(i/4)^3}{4} = \\frac{i^3}{64 \\times 4} = \\frac{-i}{256}$. According to Cauchy's Residue Theorem, the integral is $2\\pi i \\times \\text{Res}(f, z_0) = 2\\pi i \\times \\left(\\frac{-i}{256}\\right) = \\frac{-2\\pi i^2}{256} = \\frac{2\\pi}{256} = \\frac{\\pi}{128}$. Numerically, $\\frac{\\pi}{128} \\approx 0.02454369$, which rounds to $0.025$ (three decimal places). This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 0.02 to 0.03."
