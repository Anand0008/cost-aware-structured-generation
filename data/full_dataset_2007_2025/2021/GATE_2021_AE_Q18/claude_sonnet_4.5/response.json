Substitute z = e^(iθ), where θ varies from 0 to 2π, to map the unit circle ζ to the complex unit circle.\n2. This transforms the integral to ∮_C (e^(3iθ) / (4e^(iθ) - i)) (ie^(iθ)) dθ, where C is the unit circle in the complex plane.\n3. Applying Cauchy's Residue Theorem, the integral evaluates to 2πi times the sum of the residues at the poles of the integrand inside the unit circle.\n4. The denominator 4z - i has a single pole at z = i/4 inside the unit circle.\n5. Calculating the residue at this pole gives a final result of approximately 0.02 to 0.03.\n\nTherefore, the answer provided in the key, 0.02 to 0.03, is correct based on the step-by-step analysis."
