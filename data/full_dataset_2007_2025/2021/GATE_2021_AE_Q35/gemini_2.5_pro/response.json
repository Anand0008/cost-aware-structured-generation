        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify true statements. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Service ceiling is higher than absolute ceiling for a piston-propeller aircraft.**\n*   **Analysis:** According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), the absolute ceiling is defined as the altitude where the maximum rate of climb (RoC) is 0 ft/min. The service ceiling is defined as the altitude where the maximum RoC is 100 ft/min (or 50 ft/min for piston-propeller aircraft). Since an aircraft can still climb at the service ceiling but cannot climb at all at the absolute ceiling, the absolute ceiling is always *higher* than the service ceiling. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\n**B. For a given aircraft, the stall speed increases with increase in altitude.**\n*   **Analysis:** Stall speed ($V_s$) is given by the formula $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L_{max}}}}$. Here, $W$ is the aircraft weight, $S$ is the wing area, $\\rho$ is the air density, and $C_{L_{max}}$ is the maximum lift coefficient. As altitude increases, the air density ($\\rho$) decreases. Since $V_s$ is inversely proportional to the square root of density ($\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}$), a decrease in density will lead to an increase in stall speed, assuming $W$, $S$, and $C_{L_{max}}$ remain constant. This is explicitly supported by Chunk 2, which shows $V_{alt} = V_{SL} \\sqrt{\\rho_{SL} / \\rho_{alt}}$, implying speed increases with altitude for constant lift. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n**C. Everything else remaining the same, a tailwind increases the range of an aircraft.**\n*   **Analysis:** Range is the total ground distance an aircraft can cover. A tailwind is wind blowing in the same direction as the aircraft's flight path. If an aircraft maintains a constant airspeed (and thus a constant fuel consumption rate for a given flight condition), a tailwind effectively increases its ground speed. With a higher ground speed, the aircraft covers more ground distance for the same amount of fuel consumed, or covers the same distance in less time, thus increasing its range. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n**D. For a jet aircraft constrained to fly at constant altitude, there exists an altitude where its range is maximum.**\n*   **Analysis:** For a jet aircraft, range is generally given by the Breguet range equation, which involves factors like lift-to-drag ratio ($\\frac{L}{D}$), true airspeed ($V$), and thrust specific fuel consumption ($c_t$). As altitude increases, the optimal true airspeed for maximum range increases (due to lower density), and the thrust specific fuel consumption ($c_t$) of jet engines generally decreases (improving engine efficiency) up to a certain altitude. These factors combine to create an optimum altitude where the overall range is maximized. Beyond this optimum, the decreasing available thrust or other factors might reduce range. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements B, C, and D are true."

While not explicitly covering wind effects on range or optimum range altitude in detail, the general context of performance parameters was helpful."
