          "Step 3: Analyze statement C by considering range as distance over ground. With tailwind, ground speed $V_g$ is higher than airspeed $V_{air}$ for the same fuel flow, so distance covered per unit fuel increases. Thus, tailwind increases range. C is true.",

There exists an altitude where specific range $SR = V/FF$ (FF is fuel flow) is maximized, often corresponding to maximum lift-to-drag ratio or engine efficiency. Thus, D is true."
