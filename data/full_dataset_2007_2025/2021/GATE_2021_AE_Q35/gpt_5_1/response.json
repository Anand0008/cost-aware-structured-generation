        "reasoning": "Option A: Service ceiling is defined as the altitude where the maximum rate of climb equals a small specified value (e.g., 50–100 ft/min for piston-prop, 100–500 ft/min for jets). Absolute ceiling is where maximum rate of climb is zero. Therefore, absolute ceiling is higher than service ceiling. So statement A (service ceiling is higher than absolute ceiling) is false.\n\nOption B: Stall speed in terms of true airspeed is given by $V_{s} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L\\max}}}$. For a given aircraft at a given weight, $W, S, C_{L\\max}$ are constant. As altitude increases, air density $\\rho$ decreases, so $V_s$ (true airspeed) must increase. Hence, statement B is true.\n\nOption C: Range depends on ground distance covered per unit fuel. A tailwind increases ground speed for a given airspeed and fuel flow, so the aircraft covers more ground per unit fuel, increasing range. Thus, statement C is true.\n\nOption D: For a jet aircraft, range at a given altitude is maximized when flying at the condition of maximum $L/D$ (for jets, max range speed at that altitude). However, engine thrust and specific fuel consumption vary with altitude, and drag polar in terms of true airspeed interacts with density. As altitude changes, the achievable $L/D$ and the fuel flow per unit thrust change, so there exists an optimum altitude (subject to constraints like ceiling and Mach limits) at which the overall range is maximum. Therefore, statement D is true in the usual performance sense.\n\nThus, the correct set of true statements is B, C, and D, matching the official key."

          "description": "Plot or visualize the curve of maximum rate of climb versus altitude. Service ceiling is where the curve crosses a small positive ROC (e.g., 100 ft/min), and absolute ceiling is where it hits zero. This graphical view can make the relationship intuitive.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Very intuitive, helps avoid memorization errors. Cons: Requires familiarity with performance graphs and may be slower in an exam if not already internalized.",

          "pros_cons": "Pros: Reduces need to memorize formulas; builds physical intuition. Cons: Requires comfort with proportional reasoning.",

Overall, RAG was highly relevant for ceilings and climb performance."
