This is because as altitude increases, air density decreases, requiring a higher velocity to generate the same lift.\n\nC. Everything else remaining the same, a tailwind increases the range of an aircraft. This is because the tailwind reduces the ground speed required to cover the same distance, thereby reducing fuel consumption and increasing range.\n\nD. For a jet aircraft constrained to fly at constant altitude, there exists an altitude where its range is maximum. This is because as altitude increases, the decrease in air density reduces the power required for flight, but also reduces the thrust and power available from the engines. There is an optimal altitude where the balance between these effects maximizes the aircraft's range."
