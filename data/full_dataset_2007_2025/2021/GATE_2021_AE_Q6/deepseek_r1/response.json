        "reasoning": "For a turbojet engine at a given flight speed, specific thrust ($F/\\dot{m}_a$) increases monotonically with altitude in the troposphere (up to ~11 km). This is primarily due to two effects: 1) The ram pressure recovery at the inlet increases because flight Mach number increases (as speed of sound decreases with altitude), raising the overall pressure ratio. 2) The lower ambient pressure at altitude increases the nozzle pressure ratio, leading to a higher exhaust jet velocity ($V_e$). Since specific thrust is approximately $V_e - V_0$ (for perfect expansion, $p_e = p_0$), and $V_e$ increases more than any potential decrease from other factors, the net specific thrust increases. This trend is standard in propulsion cycle analysis (e.g., Mattingly, Hill & Peterson)."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Define specific thrust. Specific thrust for a turbojet is thrust per unit mass flow rate of air: $F_s = F / \\dot{m}_a$. It's a key performance parameter.",
          "Step 2: Identify governing factors. For an ideal turbojet with perfect expansion ($p_e = p_0$), $F_s \\approx (1+f)V_e - V_0 \\approx V_e - V_0$ (since fuel-air ratio $f \\ll 1$). Here, $V_e$ is nozzle exit velocity, $V_0$ is flight speed (given constant).",
          "Step 3: Analyze altitude effects on $V_e$. $V_e$ depends on the total pressure and temperature at the nozzle entry. As altitude increases: a) Ambient temperature $T_0$ decreases (in troposphere), reducing speed of sound $a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$. For constant $V_0$, flight Mach number $M_0 = V_0 / a_0$ increases. b) Ram pressure ratio $p_{t2}/p_0 = (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_0^2)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$ increases with $M_0$. c) Ambient pressure $p_0$ decreases significantly. The increased ram recovery and lower $p_0$ raise the overall expansion ratio across the nozzle, increasing $V_e$.",
          "Step 4: Consider counter effects. The decrease in $T_0$ lowers compressor inlet stagnation temperature $T_{t2} = T_0(1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_0^2)$. For a fixed turbine inlet temperature $T_{t4}$ and compressor pressure ratio, this might slightly reduce $V_e$, but the dominant effect from increased pressure ratio outweighs this. Also, non-dimensional thrust $F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$ may remain roughly constant, but $a_0$ decreases, so $F/\\dot{m}_a$ could still increase if the constant is maintained via a larger velocity differential.",
          "Step 5: Conclude the trend. Since $V_e$ increases with altitude and $V_0$ is fixed, $F_s = V_e - V_0$ increases. The increase is monotonic in the troposphere for a given flight speed."
