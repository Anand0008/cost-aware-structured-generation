        "reasoning": "For a turbojet engine operating at a given flight speed and typically maintaining a constant turbine inlet temperature ($T_{t4}$), an increase in flight altitude leads to a decrease in ambient static pressure ($P_0$). This decrease in $P_0$ results in a higher overall pressure ratio across the nozzle ($P_{t5}/P_0$, where $P_{t5}$ is the total pressure at the nozzle inlet). A higher nozzle pressure ratio allows the exhaust gases to expand to a greater extent, resulting in a higher exhaust velocity ($V_e$). Specific thrust ($F_s$) is defined as the thrust per unit mass flow rate of air, approximately given by $F_s = (1+f)V_e - V_0$. Since $V_e$ increases with altitude and $V_0$ (flight speed) is constant, the specific thrust $F_s$ increases monotonically with altitude. While absolute thrust ($F$) decreases due to lower air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_a$), specific thrust (thrust per unit mass flow) improves due to more efficient acceleration of the available air."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the definition of specific thrust ($F_s$). Specific thrust for a turbojet engine is the thrust ($F$) produced per unit mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$), i.e., $F_s = F / \\dot{m}_a$. It can be approximated by the change in velocity of the air passing through the engine: $F_s \\approx (1+f)V_e - V_0$, where $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity, $V_0$ is the flight velocity, and $f$ is the fuel-air ratio.",
          "Step 2: Identify the given conditions. The question states 'for a given flight speed' ($V_0 = \\text{constant}$) and asks about the effect of 'increase in flight altitude'.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of increasing altitude on ambient atmospheric conditions. As flight altitude increases, the ambient static pressure ($P_0$) and ambient temperature ($T_0$) decrease significantly, and consequently, air density ($\rho_0$) also decreases.",
          "Step 4: Consider typical turbojet engine operating assumptions. For performance analysis, it is generally assumed that the engine operates at its maximum allowable turbine inlet temperature ($T_{t4}$) and has a fixed compressor pressure ratio ($\\pi_c$) by design.",
          "Step 5: Determine the effect of altitude on exhaust velocity ($V_e$). The exhaust velocity is primarily determined by the total temperature and pressure at the nozzle inlet ($T_{t5}$, $P_{t5}$) and the ambient static pressure ($P_0$). With increasing altitude, $P_0$ decreases. This leads to an increase in the pressure ratio across the nozzle ($P_{t5}/P_0$). A higher nozzle pressure ratio allows for greater expansion of the exhaust gases, resulting in a higher exhaust velocity ($V_e$).",
          "Step 6: Conclude the change in specific thrust. Since $V_e$ increases with altitude (due to lower $P_0$) and $V_0$ is constant, the specific thrust $F_s = (1+f)V_e - V_0$ will increase monotonically with increasing flight altitude. The fuel-air ratio $f$ might also change, but the dominant effect is the increase in $V_e$."
