        "reasoning": "Specific thrust of a turbojet is defined as thrust per unit air mass flow rate, $F/\\dot{m}_a$. At a given flight speed (hence given $V_0$ and $M_0$ for a fixed temperature), as altitude increases, ambient density $\\rho_0$ and pressure $p_0$ decrease. The engine ingests less air mass flow ($\\dot{m}_a \\propto \\rho_0$), so absolute thrust $F$ decreases. However, the non-dimensional or specific thrust $F/\\dot{m}_a$ depends mainly on the exhaust velocity increment relative to inlet and on pressure ratio, which effectively increase with altitude for the same flight Mach number because the compressor and turbine operate with similar total temperatures while $a_0$ decreases. Standard turbojet cycle analysis (Hill & Peterson, Ganesan, and the RAG video on non-dimensional thrust) shows that the non-dimensional thrust $F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$ remains nearly constant with altitude at fixed $M_0$. Since $a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$ decreases with altitude (lower $T_0$), keeping $F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$ approximately constant implies that $F/\\dot{m}_a$ (specific thrust) increases roughly in proportion to $a_0^{-1}$, i.e., it increases monotonically with altitude. Therefore option A is correct."

          "Step 1: Recall that specific thrust of a turbojet is defined as thrust per unit air mass flow, $F_s = F/\\dot{m}_a$.",
          "Step 2: From turbojet momentum theory, $F/\\dot{m}_a \\approx (1+f)V_7 - V_0$ (pressure term usually small), so specific thrust is essentially the exhaust-inlet velocity difference per unit mass flow.",
          "Step 3: At a fixed flight speed (fixed $M_0$), as altitude increases, ambient temperature $T_0$ and speed of sound $a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$ decrease. For a given $M_0$, $V_0 = M_0 a_0$ also decreases with altitude.",
          "Step 4: Cycle analysis (as in Hill & Peterson and the RAG video) shows that the non-dimensional thrust $F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$ is nearly independent of altitude at fixed $M_0$ and turbine inlet temperature, because the internal total temperatures and pressure ratios are set by engine design and are not strongly affected by ambient pressure.",
          "Step 5: If $F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$ is approximately constant and $a_0$ decreases with altitude, then $F/\\dot{m}_a = \\big(F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)\\big) a_0$ must increase as altitude increases (since $a_0$ is in the denominator of the non-dimensional expression).",

Anderson's propulsion overview was moderately helpful. Some other chunks focused on airplane performance and ceilings rather than engine-specific thrust, so internal knowledge was also used to connect the dots."
