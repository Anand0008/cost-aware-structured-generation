          "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. To maintain zero sideslip (no net yaw) after a right engine failure, the yawing moment from the asymmetric thrust of the left engine must be exactly balanced by the yawing moment generated by the rudder.",
          "Step 2: Define the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust. For a twin-engine aircraft with one engine failed, the yawing moment about the aircraft's center of gravity is N_thrust = T_operating * y_engine, where T_operating = 8000 N (thrust of the left engine) and y_engine is the lateral distance from the aircraft centerline to the thrust line of the operating engine. Given the spanwise distance between engines is 10 m, y_engine = 10 m / 2 = 5 m. So, N_thrust = 8000 N * 5 m = 40000 N·m.",
          "Step 3: Define the yawing moment due to rudder deflection. The rudder moment is N_rudder = C_{n_{\\delta_r}} * \\delta_r * q * S * b, where C_{n_{\\delta_r}} = -0.002 /deg, q = 0.5 * \\rho * V^2 is the dynamic pressure, \\rho = 1.225 kg/m³, V = 100 m/s, S = 50 m² (wing area), and b = 10 m (wing span). Calculate q: q = 0.5 * 1.225 * (100)^2 = 0.5 * 1.225 * 10000 = 6125 N/m² (Pa).",
          "Step 4: Set up the equilibrium equation: N_thrust + N_rudder = 0. Therefore, 40000 + (-0.002 * \\delta_r * 6125 * 50 * 10) = 0. Calculate the coefficient for rudder moment: -0.002 * 6125 * 50 * 10 = -0.002 * 3,062,500 = -6125. So the equation becomes 40000 - 6125 * \\delta_r = 0.",
