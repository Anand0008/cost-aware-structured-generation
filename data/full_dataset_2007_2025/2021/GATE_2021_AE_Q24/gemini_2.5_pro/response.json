The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust ($N_{thrust}$):**\n    With the right engine non-functional, the left engine produces thrust. The lateral distance from the aircraft's centerline to the engine ($y_{engine}$) is half the spanwise distance between the two engines.\n    $y_{engine} = \\frac{10\\text{ m}}{2} = 5\\text{ m}$\n    $N_{thrust} = T \\times y_{engine} = 8000\\text{ N} \\times 5\\text{ m} = 40000\\text{ N m}$\n    (This moment tends to yaw the aircraft nose to the right, conventionally a positive yawing moment).\n\n2.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure ($q$):**\n    $q = 0.5 \\times \\rho \\times V^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225\\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (100\\text{ m/s})^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225 \\times 10000 = 6125\\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the yawing moment equilibrium equation:**\n    To maintain zero sideslip, the net yawing moment must be zero.
