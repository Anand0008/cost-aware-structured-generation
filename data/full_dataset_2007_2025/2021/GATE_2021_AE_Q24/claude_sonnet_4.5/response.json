This can be done by applying the yawing moment equilibrium equation and using the given aircraft and flight condition parameters.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust from the remaining engine.\n2. Set this equal to the opposing yawing moment from the rudder deflection.\n3. Solve for the required rudder deflection angle.\n\nUsing the given values for thrust, engine spacing, aerodynamic coefficients, and flight speed, the calculated rudder deflection angle is between 6.50 and 6.60 degrees, which matches the provided correct answer range."
