        "reasoning": "With one engine inoperative on a twin-engine aircraft, the operating engine produces a yawing moment about the CG equal to thrust times its lateral offset. The rudder must generate an equal and opposite yawing moment. For symmetric engines separated by 10 m, each engine is 5 m from the centerline. The yawing moment from the live engine is N_thrust = 8000 N × 5 m = 40000 N·m. The rudder yawing moment is N_rudder = C_n_{\\delta_r} \\delta_r q S b, where q = 0.5 \\rho V^2, S = 50 m^2, b = 10 m, C_n_{\\delta_r} = -0.002 per degree, and V = 100 m/s. At sea level, q = 0.5 × 1.225 × 100^2 = 6125 N/m^2. Then q S b = 6125 × 50 × 10 = 3.0625 × 10^6 N·m. The dimensional yawing moment from rudder is N_rudder = C_n_{\\delta_r} \\delta_r q S b = (-0.002/deg) × \\delta_r(deg) × 3.0625 × 10^6 = -6125 × \\delta_r N·m. Setting N_thrust + N_rudder = 0 gives 40000 - 6125 \\delta_r = 0, so \\delta_r = 40000 / 6125 ≈ 6.535 deg. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 6.54 deg, which lies within the official answer range 6.50–6.60. The method matches the standard engine-out yaw control derivation given in the RAG context."
