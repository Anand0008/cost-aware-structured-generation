Statement B is considered true in many standard references and the GATE answer key: The Kutta condition is primarily formulated for airfoils with sharp trailing edges; for cusped trailing edges, a similar condition (zero velocity) is applied, but the classical statement often emphasizes sharp edges (RAG chunks 3,4,6). Statement C is false: The trailing edge is a stagnation point only for cusped trailing edges; for sharp trailing edges, the velocity is finite (RAG chunk 4). Statement D is true: The core of the Kutta condition is that the flow must leave the trailing edge smoothly, preventing infinite velocities and fixing separation (RAG chunks 1,2,3,6)."

          "Step 3: Evaluate Statement B: 'It is applicable only to airfoils with sharp trailing edge.' This is considered true in many textbooks and the GATE context. The Kutta condition is explicitly defined for sharp trailing edges to avoid infinite velocities. For cusped edges, the condition often implies zero velocity, but the principle of smooth flow still applies, though some sources restrict the term 'Kutta condition' to sharp edges.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Statement C: 'The trailing edge of an airfoil is a stagnation point.' This is not universally true. For a cusped trailing edge (e.g., classical Zhukovsky airfoil), the velocity is zero (stagnation point). For a sharp trailing edge (finite angle), the velocity is finite and non-zero. Thus, the statement is false.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Statement D: 'The flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly.' This is the fundamental verbal statement of the Kutta condition. It means the upper and lower surface streamlines meet at the trailing edge without intersecting at an angle, ensuring finite velocities and realistic flow.",
