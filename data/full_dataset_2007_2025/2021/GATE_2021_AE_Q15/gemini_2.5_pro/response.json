        "reasoning": "The Kutta condition is a fundamental principle in classical potential flow theory for airfoils, designed to make the mathematical solutions physically realistic. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A. It is utilized to determine the circulation on an airfoil.** This statement is **TRUE**. Without the Kutta condition, potential flow theory would predict an infinite number of possible circulation values around an airfoil, leading to non-unique lift predictions. The Kutta condition, by enforcing smooth flow at the trailing edge, uniquely determines the amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) generated, which is essential for calculating lift via the Kutta-Joukowski theorem (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).\n\n*   **B. It is applicable only to airfoils with sharp trailing edge.** This statement is **TRUE**. The Kutta condition is specifically formulated to address the unphysical infinite velocity predicted by potential flow theory at a sharp corner (the trailing edge). For blunt bodies, flow separation occurs differently and is not governed by this condition. Even for cusped airfoils, which have a zero-angle trailing edge, the concept of a 'sharp' geometric singularity where flow must depart smoothly still applies (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).\n\n*   **C. The trailing edge of an airfoil is a stagnation point.** This statement is **FALSE**. This is a common misconception. For a *cusped* trailing edge (where the upper and lower surfaces meet tangentially, like a classical Zhukovsky airfoil), the Kutta condition indeed implies that the velocity at the trailing edge is zero, making it a stagnation point. However, for a *sharp* trailing edge with a finite angle, the Kutta condition ensures that the velocity at the trailing edge is finite and non-zero. Since the statement generalizes to 'an airfoil' (implying all airfoils), it is incorrect (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4).\n\n*   **D. The flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly.** This statement is **TRUE**. This is the core physical premise and definition of the Kutta condition. It ensures that the streamlines from the upper and lower surfaces merge smoothly at the trailing edge, preventing turbulent eddies or infinite velocities that would otherwise be predicted by purely inviscid theory (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)."

          "**Step 1: Understand the Kutta Condition's Purpose.** Recognize that the Kutta condition is a crucial physical constraint applied to inviscid potential flow theory to ensure that theoretical solutions for flow around airfoils are physically realistic.",
          "**Step 2: Evaluate Option A (Circulation Determination).** Recall that potential flow alone does not uniquely determine circulation. The Kutta condition is introduced precisely to select a unique value of circulation by enforcing smooth flow at the trailing edge, which then allows for the calculation of lift.",
          "**Step 3: Evaluate Option B (Applicability to Sharp Trailing Edges).** Consider the geometric context. The Kutta condition addresses the mathematical singularity (infinite velocity) that arises at a sharp corner in potential flow. Therefore, its primary application is to airfoils with sharp trailing edges where such a singularity would otherwise occur.",
          "**Step 4: Evaluate Option C (Stagnation Point at Trailing Edge).** Distinguish between different types of trailing edges. For a *cusped* trailing edge (zero angle), the velocity is indeed zero (stagnation point). However, for a *sharp* trailing edge with a finite angle, the velocity is finite and non-zero. Since the statement makes a general claim for 'an airfoil', it is not universally true.",
          "**Step 5: Evaluate Option D (Smooth Flow Departure).** This is the fundamental physical intuition behind the Kutta condition. It mandates that the flow must leave the trailing edge smoothly, without abrupt changes or infinite velocities, mirroring observed real fluid behavior.",
          "**Step 6: Conclude the Correct Options.** Based on the evaluations, statements A, B, and D are true."
