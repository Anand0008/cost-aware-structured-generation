        "reasoning": "To find the location of maximum deflection, we need to find the point where the slope of the beam is zero. This is achieved by differentiating the given deflection equation with respect to $x$ and setting the derivative to zero.\\nGiven deflection equation:\\n$y = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2x^4 - 3lx^3 + l^3x)$\\n\\nStep 1: Differentiate $y$ with respect to $x$ to find the slope $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{w}{48EI} (2x^4 - 3lx^3 + l^3x) \\right]$\\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{w}{48EI} (8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3)$\\n\\nStep 2: Set the slope to zero to find the locations of maximum/minimum deflection:\\n$\\frac{w}{48EI} (8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3) = 0$\\nSince $\\frac{w}{48EI}$ is a non-zero constant, we must have:\\n$8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3 = 0$\\n\\nStep 3: Convert to a non-dimensional form. Let $X = \\frac{x}{l}$, so $x = Xl$. Substitute this into the equation:\\n$8(Xl)^3 - 9l(Xl)^2 + l^3 = 0$\\n$8X^3l^3 - 9X^2l^3 + l^3 = 0$\\nDivide the entire equation by $l^3$ (assuming $l \\neq 0$):\\n$8X^3 - 9X^2 + 1 = 0$\\n\\nStep 4: Solve the cubic equation for $X$. We can test for simple roots. Notice that if $X=1$, $8(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 1 = 8 - 9 + 1 = 0$. So, $X=1$ is a root. This means $(X-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.\\nPerform polynomial division or synthetic division:\\n$(8X^3 - 9X^2 + 1) \\div (X-1) = 8X^2 - X - 1$\\nSo, the equation becomes: $(X-1)(8X^2 - X - 1) = 0$\\n\\nStep 5: Solve the quadratic equation $8X^2 - X - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $X = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\\n$X = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(-1)}}{2(8)}$\\n$X = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 32}}{16}$\\n$X = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{16}$\\n\\nStep 6: Calculate the numerical values for the roots:\\n$\\sqrt{33} \\approx 5.74456$\\n$X_1 = \\frac{1 + 5.74456}{16} = \\frac{6.74456}{16} \\approx 0.421535$\\n$X_2 = \\frac{1 - 5.74456}{16} = \\frac{-4.74456}{16} \\approx -0.296535$\\n\\nStep 7: Identify the physically meaningful root. The possible non-dimensional locations where the slope is zero are $X=1$, $X \\approx 0.4215$, and $X \\approx -0.2965$. Since $x$ is the distance from the point of support, $0 \\le x \\le l$, which means $0 \\le X \\le 1$. The root $X=-0.2965$ is not physically relevant.\\nAt $X=1$ (i.e., $x=l$), the deflection $y = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2l^4 - 3l(l)^3 + l^3(l)) = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2l^4 - 3l^4 + l^4) = 0$. This is a support point where deflection is zero, not maximum.\\nTherefore, the location of maximum deflection must be $X \\approx 0.4215$.\\n\\nStep 8: Round off the result to two decimal places.\\n$X \\approx 0.42$\\nThis value falls within the given answer key range of 0.41 to 0.43."

While the specific deflection equation given in the question was not present, the RAG confirmed the relevant subject matter and principles (e.g., how to find maximum deflection, the role of EI). The problem primarily tested the application of calculus to a given function, which is a general mathematical skill applied in a structures context, rather than direct recall of a specific formula from the RAG."
