Set f'(x) = 0: 8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3 = 0. Non-dimensionalize with u = x/l: 8u^3 - 9u^2 + 1 = 0. Solving this cubic numerically, the physically relevant root in (0,1) is u ≈ 0.421.

While the exact polynomial given in the question is not from RAG, the context confirms the underlying theory (M = EI d^2y/dx^2 and standard deflection results). The actual optimization step (taking derivative of the given y and solving for x/l) relied mainly on internal mathematical reasoning."
