According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1 and Chunk 3), LH2/LOX engines, such as those used in the Space Shuttle main engine, achieve a vacuum specific impulse of approximately 455 seconds. Chunk 3 further states that for highly optimized systems, it can reach 460-470 seconds. Option B, 450 sec, is the closest value to this established range. Other options (49 sec, 6000 sec, 40000 sec) are either too low for a high-performance chemical propellant or too high, belonging to the realm of electric propulsion systems."
