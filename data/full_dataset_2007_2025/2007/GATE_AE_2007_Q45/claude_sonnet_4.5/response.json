Using the isentropic compression formula, we can derive the pressure ratio as follows:\n\n$T_{{02}} / T_{{01}} = (p_{{02}} / p_{{01}})^{{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}}$\nRearranging, we get:\n$p_{{02}} / p_{{01}} = (T_{{02}} / T_{{01}})^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$\n\nGiven:\n- $T_{{01}} = 300$ K\n- $T_{{02}} = 424$ K \n- $\\gamma = 1.4$ (for air)\n- $\\eta_c = 0.81$\n\nUsing the isentropic efficiency formula:\n$\\eta_c = (T_{{02s}} - T_{{01}}) / (T_{{02}} - T_{{01}})$\nSolving for $T_{{02s}}$:\n$T_{{02s}} = T_{{01}} + (T_{{02}} - T_{{01}}) / \\eta_c$\n$T_{{02s}} = 300 + (424 - 300) / 0.81 = 543.21$ K\n\nNow, plugging into the pressure ratio formula:\n$p_{{02}} / p_{{01}} = (543.21 / 300)^{1.4 / (1.4 - 1)} = 2.75$\n\nTherefore, the pressure ratio across the compressor is 2.75, which matches the correct answer A."
