The solution involves two main steps:\n1.  Use the definition of isentropic efficiency to find the ideal (isentropic) exit stagnation temperature ($T_{02s}$). The isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) relates the ideal temperature rise to the actual temperature rise: $\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02} - T_{01}}$.\n2.  Once $T_{02s}$ is known, use the isentropic relation between stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure ratio for a gas with constant specific heats: $\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = \\left(\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}$.\n\nGiven:\n$T_{01} = 300 \\text{ K}$\n$T_{02} = 424 \\text{ K}$\n$\\eta_c = 0.81$\n$\\gamma = 1.4$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate ideal exit stagnation temperature ($T_{02s}$)**\nActual temperature rise: $\\Delta T_{actual} = T_{02} - T_{01} = 424 - 300 = 124 \\text{ K}$\nFrom the isentropic efficiency definition:\n$\\eta_c = \\frac{\\Delta T_{isentropic}}{\\Delta T_{actual}} = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02} - T_{01}}$\n$0.81 = \\frac{T_{02s} - 300}{124}$\n$T_{02s} - 300 = 0.81 \\times 124 = 100.44 \\text{ K}$\n$T_{02s} = 300 + 100.44 = 400.44 \\text{ K}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pressure ratio ($P_{02}/P_{01}$)**\nUsing the isentropic relation:\n$\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = \\left(\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}$\n$\\frac{400.44}{300} = \\left(\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{1.4-1}{1.4}}$\n$1.3348 = \\left(\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{0.4}{1.4}}$\n$1.3348 = \\left(\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}}\\right)^{0.2857}$\n\nTo find the pressure ratio, raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{0.2857}$ (which is approximately 3.5):\n$\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}} = (1.3348)^{\\frac{1}{0.2857}} = (1.3348)^{3.5}$\n$\\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}} \\approx 2.75$\n\nThis matches option A."
