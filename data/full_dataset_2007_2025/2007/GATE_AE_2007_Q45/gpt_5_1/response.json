        "reasoning": "Given: inlet stagnation temperature $T_{01} = 300\\,\\text{K}$, exit stagnation temperature $T_{02} = 424\\,\\text{K}$, compressor isentropic efficiency $\\eta_c = 0.81$, and $\\gamma = 1.4$.\\n1) For a compressor, isentropic efficiency is defined as $$\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02} - T_{01}}$$ where $T_{02s}$ is the isentropic exit stagnation temperature corresponding to the same pressure ratio.\\nRearrange to find $T_{02s}$: $$T_{02s} - T_{01} = \\eta_c (T_{02} - T_{01})$$ $$T_{02s} = T_{01} + \\eta_c (T_{02} - T_{01})$$ Substitute values: $T_{02} - T_{01} = 424 - 300 = 124\\,\\text{K}$. So, $$T_{02s} = 300 + 0.81 \\times 124 = 300 + 100.44 = 400.44\\,\\text{K}$$\\n2) For an isentropic compression of an ideal gas with constant $\\gamma$, the stagnation temperature ratio and pressure ratio are related by $$\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = \\left(\\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}}$$ Thus, $$\\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$$ Compute the temperature ratio: $$\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = \\frac{400.44}{300} \\approx 1.3348$$ With $\\gamma = 1.4$, exponent $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1} = \\frac{1.4}{0.4} = 3.5$. So $$\\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = (1.3348)^{3.5}$$ Evaluate: $\\ln(1.3348) \\approx 0.288$, so $3.5 \\times 0.288 \\approx 1.008$. Then $e^{1.008} \\approx 2.74$. More directly using a calculator gives $\\approx 2.75$.\\n3) Among the options, 2.75 (option A) matches this result. The other options (5.60, 65.00, 228.00) are far from the physically reasonable pressure ratio for such a modest temperature rise, confirming A is correct."
