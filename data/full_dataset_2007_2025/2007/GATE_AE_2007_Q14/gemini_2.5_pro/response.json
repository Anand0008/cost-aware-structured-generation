In its most general form, this tensor has $3^4 = 81$ components. However, due to inherent symmetries: \\n1. Minor symmetries: $C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl}$ and $C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$ (due to symmetry of stress and strain tensors). \\n2. Major symmetry: $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$ (due to the existence of a strain energy density function, implying that the order of indices for the stress and strain components can be interchanged). \\nApplying these symmetries reduces the number of independent elastic constants. For the most general anisotropic material, which exhibits triclinic symmetry, the number of independent elastic constants is 21. This fact is explicitly stated in multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (e.g., Chunk 3, 4, 5, and 6)."
