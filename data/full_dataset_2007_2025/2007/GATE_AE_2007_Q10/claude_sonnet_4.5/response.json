        "reasoning": "The question states that the two airplanes are identical except for the location of the wing. This means that the only difference between the two configurations is the vertical placement of the wing relative to the fuselage and center of gravity (CG).\n\nAccording to the concepts covered in the retrieved knowledge, the longitudinal static stability of a high-wing and low-wing aircraft configuration is primarily affected by the contribution of the drag force to the pitching moment. In a high-wing configuration, the drag acts above the CG, creating a destabilizing nose-up pitching moment as the angle of attack increases. In a low-wing configuration, the drag acts below the CG, creating a stabilizing nose-down pitching moment.\n\nHowever, these stabilizing and destabilizing effects tend to cancel out, resulting in the longitudinal static stability being approximately the same for the two configurations, assuming the CG location is the same. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the longitudinal static stability of the low-wing and high-wing configurations will be the same."
