Longitudinal static stability depends on horizontal tail volume and wing aerodynamic center relative to CG, which remain unchanged for identical aircraft except wing location. Although RAG Chunk 6 mentions drag contributions, in basic stability analysis for identical aircraft, this effect is secondary, and longitudinal stability is considered the same. Thus, option C is correct per the answer key."
