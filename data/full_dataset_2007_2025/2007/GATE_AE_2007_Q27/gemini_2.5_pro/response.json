        "reasoning": "Aerodynamic coefficients, such as the pressure coefficient ($C_p$), are nondimensional quantities. For two geometrically similar airfoils (i.e., of the 'same family') operating at the same flow conditions (same Mach number, Reynolds number, and angle of attack), the flow patterns around them are geometrically similar. Consequently, the nondimensional pressure distribution, and thus the minimum pressure coefficient, will be identical for both airfoils, regardless of their absolute size. The question states they are of the 'same family' and operating at the 'same angle of attack.' Assuming they are in the same fluid and at the same freestream velocity (which implies same Mach and Reynolds numbers, or at least that Reynolds number effects are negligible for this comparison), their minimum pressure coefficients will be equal. Therefore, the ratio $C_{p,min,larger} / C_{p,min,smaller}$ is 1.0."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the definition of pressure coefficient. The pressure coefficient $C_p = \\frac{P - P_{\\infty}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}^2}$ is a nondimensional quantity that describes the local pressure relative to the freestream pressure and dynamic pressure.",
          "Step 2: Recognize the properties of aerodynamic coefficients. Aerodynamic coefficients ($C_L$, $C_D$, $C_M$, $C_p$) are nondimensional. They are primarily functions of the body's shape (geometry), angle of attack ($\\alpha$), Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$), and Reynolds number ($Re$). They are fundamentally *independent* of the absolute physical size of the body, provided geometric similarity and flow similarity (same $M_{\\infty}$, $Re$, $\\alpha$) are maintained.",
          "Step 3: Interpret the given conditions. 'Same family' implies geometric similarity (the airfoils have the same shape, just scaled). 'Same angle of attack' means $\\alpha$ is identical for both. The problem implicitly assumes they are operating in the same fluid and at the same freestream velocity, thus at the same Mach number and similar Reynolds number (or that Reynolds number effects are negligible for this comparison, which is a common assumption in such problems unless specified).",
          "Step 4: Apply the principle of aerodynamic similarity. Since both airfoils are geometrically similar, at the same angle of attack, and in the same flow conditions, the nondimensional flow field around them will be identical. This means that at any geometrically corresponding point on the two airfoils, the local pressure coefficient will be the same.",
          "Step 5: Conclude for the minimum pressure coefficient. The minimum pressure coefficient ($C_{p,min}$) is simply the lowest value of $C_p$ occurring on the airfoil surface. Since the entire $C_p$ distribution is identical for both airfoils, their minimum values must also be identical.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the ratio. Therefore, $C_{p,min,larger} = C_{p,min,smaller}$, which means the ratio $C_{p,min,larger} / C_{p,min,smaller} = 1.0$."
