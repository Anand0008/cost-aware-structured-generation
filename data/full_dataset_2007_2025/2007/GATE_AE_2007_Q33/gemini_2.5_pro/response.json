          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters from the problem statement: aircraft weight ($W = 73108 N$), propeller efficiency ($\\eta_P = 0.8$), and maximum rate of climb ($RC = 15 m/s$). Note that the flight speed ($V = 50 m/s$) is provided but is not directly used in the calculation of excess power when the rate of climb is already given.",
          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental relationship between the excess power available to the aircraft ($P_{\\text{excess, A}}$) and its rate of climb ($RC$). This relationship is given by $P_{\\text{excess, A}} = W \\cdot RC$. This represents the power effectively used to gain altitude.",
          "Step 3: Understand the connection between the power available at the propeller ($P_A$) and the Brake Power ($P_{\\text{BP}}$) generated by the engine. The propeller efficiency ($\\eta_P$) links these two, such that $P_A = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{BP}}$. Consequently, the excess power available at the propeller is related to the excess Brake Power from the engine by $P_{\\text{excess, A}} = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$.",
          "Step 4: Combine the relationships from Step 2 and Step 3. Since both expressions represent the same excess power available for climb, we can equate them: $W \\cdot RC = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the combined equation to solve for the desired quantity, the excess Brake Power ($P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$): $P_{\\text{excess, BP}} = \\frac{W \\cdot RC}{\\eta_P}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the numerical values into the derived formula: $P_{\\text{excess, BP}} = \\frac{73108 N \\cdot 15 m/s}{0.8}$.",
          "Step 7: Perform the calculation: $P_{\\text{excess, BP}} = \\frac{1096620 W}{0.8} = 1370775 W$.",
          "Step 8: Convert the result from Watts to kilowatts (kW) as the options are in kW: $1370775 W = 1370.775 kW$. Rounding to the nearest integer, this is approximately $1371 kW$."
