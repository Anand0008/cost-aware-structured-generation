        "reasoning": "An ideal ramjet engine operates on the Brayton cycle, also known as the Joule-Brayton cycle. This cycle is characterized by isentropic compression, constant pressure heat addition, and isentropic expansion. In a ramjet, the high-speed incoming air is compressed isentropically in the diffuser (ram effect), heat is added at constant pressure in the combustor, and the hot gases expand isentropically through the nozzle to produce thrust. This is explicitly stated in multiple retrieved knowledge chunks. For example, Chunk 2 mentions, \"The ramjet operates on an open thermodynamic cycle, ideally approximating the Joule-Brayton cycle with constant pressure heat addition.\" Chunk 6 further confirms, \"A ramjet operates on a continuous-flow, constant-pressure combustion cycle (approximating the Brayton cycle).\""

These are: (a) Isentropic compression in the diffuser (due to deceleration of high-speed air), (b) Constant pressure heat addition in the combustor (fuel burning), and (c) Isentropic expansion in the nozzle (to generate thrust).",
          "Step 3: Recall the definitions of common ideal thermodynamic cycles. The Rankine cycle is for steam power plants, the Otto cycle for spark-ignition internal combustion engines, and the Carnot cycle is a theoretical reversible cycle representing maximum efficiency.",
          "Step 4: Match the ramjet's ideal processes to a known cycle. The sequence of isentropic compression, constant pressure heat addition, and isentropic expansion perfectly aligns with the definition of the ideal Brayton cycle (also known as the Joule cycle).",
          "Step 5: Conclude that the ideal ramjet operates on the Brayton cycle."
