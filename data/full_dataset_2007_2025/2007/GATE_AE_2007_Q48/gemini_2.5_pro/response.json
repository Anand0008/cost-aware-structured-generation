        "reasoning": "The question asks for the most suitable material for an axial flow turbine operating at high temperatures. Turbine blades are exposed to extremely hot gas streams (often exceeding 1000°C in modern engines, though the material itself might operate at lower temperatures due to cooling). The primary material properties required are high-temperature strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance.\n\n1.  **Aluminum alloy (D)**: Aluminum alloys have low melting points and rapidly lose strength at relatively low temperatures (typically above 150-200°C). They are completely unsuitable for turbine sections.\n2.  **Steel alloy (A)**: While some specialized steels (like maraging steels) offer good strength, their high-temperature capabilities, especially creep and oxidation resistance, are generally inferior to superalloys required for the hottest turbine sections. They are often used in cooler sections or for structural components, but not for high-temperature turbine blades.\n3.  **Titanium alloy (B)**: Titanium alloys offer an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance. They are widely used in compressor stages and cooler parts of the engine. However, as per the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, Chunk 3), titanium alloys are limited to temperatures around 550°C due to their high chemical reactivity and weakening at very high temperatures. This temperature limit makes them unsuitable for the hottest sections of an axial flow turbine.\n4.  **Nickel alloy (C)**: Nickel-based superalloys are specifically designed for high-temperature applications. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, Chunk 2, Chunk 5) explicitly states that nickel-based superalloys are used in the hottest sections of gas turbines, capable of operating up to approximately 925°C (and even higher with advanced cooling and coatings). They possess exceptional high-temperature strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance, making them the material of choice for turbine blades. Alloying elements like chromium and aluminum further enhance these properties.\n\nTherefore, Nickel alloy (specifically nickel-based superalloys) is the correct choice for an axial flow turbine operating at high temperatures."
