          "Step 1: Understand the operating environment. An axial flow turbine in a gas turbine engine operates in a hot gas stream post-combustion, experiencing extremely high temperatures (often 1000°C or more), high centrifugal stresses, and oxidizing conditions.",
          "Step 2: Identify critical material requirements for this environment. The material must possess: 1) High-temperature strength (retains strength when hot), 2) High creep strength (resists slow deformation under stress over time), 3) High oxidation/corrosion resistance, 4) High resistance to centrifugal and bending stresses.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate each option against these requirements, referencing standard aerospace materials knowledge and the provided RAG context.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option D (Aluminum alloy). Aluminum alloys have low density but very poor high-temperature strength; they soften and lose strength well below 300°C. They are unsuitable for turbine hot sections.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option A (Steel alloy). Some high-strength steels are used in engines, but generally in compressor sections. Their high-temperature capability is typically lower than that of nickel superalloys, and they suffer from higher density, increasing centrifugal load.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option B (Titanium alloy). Titanium alloys have excellent strength-to-weight ratio and are dominant in compressor sections. However, as per RAG context, they become chemically reactive and lose strength above approximately 550°C, making them unsuitable for the highest temperature turbine stages.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate Option C (Nickel alloy). Nickel-based superalloys are specifically developed for turbine hot sections. As per RAG, they offer exceptional strength and creep resistance up to ~925°C (and modern versions even higher), along with excellent oxidation resistance due to alloying elements like chromium and aluminium.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that Nickel alloy (C) is the only material listed explicitly designed to meet all the stringent requirements of a high-temperature turbine blade."
