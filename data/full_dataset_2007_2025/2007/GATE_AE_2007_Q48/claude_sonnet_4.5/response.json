        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. Nickel alloys, also known as nickel-based superalloys, are the most suitable material for designing an axial flow turbine operating at high temperatures. This is because nickel alloys have exceptional strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance at the elevated temperatures encountered in the turbine section of a gas turbine engine. The retrieved knowledge from the book notes confirms that nickel-based superalloys can withstand temperatures up to around 925°C, which is significantly higher than the temperature limits of steel alloys (around 550°C) and titanium alloys (around 550°C). Aluminum alloys, on the other hand, are not suitable for high-temperature turbine applications due to their relatively low strength and temperature resistance."
