The general formula for effective torsional stiffness `J` for a single-cell thin-walled section is given by:\n`J = \\frac{4 A_m^2 t}{S_m}`\nwhere:\n*   `A_m` is the mean enclosed area of the cross-section.\n*   `t` is the wall thickness.\n*   `S_m` is the mean perimeter of the cross-section.\n\nFor a thin-walled closed tube with a mean radius `r` and thickness `t`:\n*   The mean enclosed area `A_m` is the area of a circle with radius `r`: `A_m = \\pi r^2`.\n*   The mean perimeter `S_m` is the circumference of a circle with radius `r`: `S_m = 2 \\pi r`.\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the Bredt-Batho formula:\n`J = \\frac{4 (\\pi r^2)^2 t}{2 \\pi r}`\n`J = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 r^4 t}{2 \\pi r}`\n`J = 2 \\pi r^3 t`\n\nThis result matches option B. This formula is also consistent with the approximation for the polar moment of inertia of a thin-walled circular tube, `J \\approx (\\pi/4) d_{avg}^3 t`, where `d_{avg} = 2r`. Substituting `d_{avg} = 2r` gives `J \\approx (\\pi/4) (2r)^3 t = (\\pi/4) 8r^3 t = 2 \\pi r^3 t`."
