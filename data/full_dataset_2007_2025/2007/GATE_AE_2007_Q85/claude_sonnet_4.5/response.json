Using the relationship between polytropic and isentropic efficiency for a compressor, we can calculate the isentropic efficiency. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the compressor pressure ratio: $\\pi_c = P_{t3} / P_{t2} = 3.15 / 0.9 = 3.5$\n2. Use the given polytropic efficiency $\\eta_{pc} = 0.89$ and the compressor pressure ratio to find the isentropic efficiency $\\eta_c$ using the formula:\n$\\eta_c = \\left[\\left(\\pi_c\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} - 1\\right] / \\left[\\left(\\pi_c\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/(\\gamma\\eta_{pc})} - 1\\right]$\n3. Plugging in the values, with $\\gamma = 1.4$, we get:\n$\\eta_c = \\left[(3.5)^{(1.4-1)/1.4} - 1\\right] / \\left[(3.5)^{(1.4-1)/(1.4\\times0.89)} - 1\\right] = 0.869$\n\nThus, the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is 0.869, which matches the correct answer B."
