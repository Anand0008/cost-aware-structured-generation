Furthermore, if non-trivial solutions exist, they form an infinite set (since any scalar multiple of a solution is also a solution, and there is at least one free variable). The third equation is a scalar multiple of the first, indicating linear dependence and redundancy. Hence, there are infinitely many non-trivial solutions. This matches option B."
