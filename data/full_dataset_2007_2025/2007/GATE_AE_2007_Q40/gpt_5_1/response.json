To check for non-trivial solutions, we examine linear dependence of the equations or the rank of the coefficient matrix.\n\nWrite the coefficient matrix:\nA = [[1, -1, 2],\n     [2,  3,-1],\n     [2, -2, 4]].\n\nObserve that the third equation is exactly twice the first:\n2(x - y + 2z) = 2x - 2y + 4z,\nso equation 3 is not independent. Thus rank(A) ≤ 2.\n\nCompute the determinant to see if rank is 3 or less:\n|A| = 1 * det[[3, -1],[-2, 4]] - (-1) * det[[2, -1],[2, 4]] + 2 * det[[2, 3],[2, -2]].\n\nCompute each 2×2 determinant:\n- det1 = 3·4 - (-1)(-2) = 12 - 2 = 10,\n- det2 = 2·4 - (-1)·2 = 8 + 2 = 10,\n- det3 = 2·(-2) - 3·2 = -4 - 6 = -10.\n\nSo |A| = 1·10 - (-1)·10 + 2·(-10) = 10 + 10 - 20 = 0.\nTherefore rank(A) < 3. Since at least two rows are independent (e.g., row1 and row2 are not multiples), rank(A) = 2.\n\nFor a homogeneous system with n = 3 unknowns and rank r = 2, the number of free variables is n - r = 1, so there are infinitely many non-trivial solutions (a one-parameter family).
