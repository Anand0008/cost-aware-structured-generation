        "reasoning": "The Von Mises yield criterion, also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion, for a general 3D stress state in terms of principal stresses ($\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, $\\sigma_3$) is given by: $$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 ]}$$Yielding occurs when $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_Y$, where $\\sigma_Y$ is the uniaxial tensile yield strength. Therefore, the yield condition is: $$\\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 ] = \\sigma_Y^2$$For a plane stress problem, the third principal stress is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_3 = 0$. Substituting $\\sigma_3 = 0$ into the equation: $$\\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - 0)^2 + (0 - \\sigma_1)^2 ] = \\sigma_Y^2$$ $$\\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_1^2 - 2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2) + \\sigma_2^2 + \\sigma_1^2 ] = \\sigma_Y^2$$ $$\\frac{1}{2} [ 2\\sigma_1^2 - 2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + 2\\sigma_2^2 ] = \\sigma_Y^2$$ $$\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_Y^2$$This equation represents the yield surface. For the material to remain elastic or be at the point of yielding, the equivalent stress must be less than or equal to the yield stress. Hence, the criterion is: $$\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2 \\le \\sigma_Y^2$$This matches option A. RAG Chunk 1 explicitly provides this derivation and final formula."
