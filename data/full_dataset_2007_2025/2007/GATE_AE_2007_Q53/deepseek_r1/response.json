The general von Mises criterion is σ_v = √(0.5[(σ₁-σ₂)²+(σ₂-σ₃)²+(σ₃-σ₁)²]) = σ_Y. For plane stress with σ₃ = 0, this simplifies to σ_v = √(σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂²) = σ_Y, or equivalently σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂² = σ_Y². The criterion requires that for no yielding, the equivalent stress must be less than or equal to the yield stress, so σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂² ≤ σ_Y². Option A matches this exactly. Option B resembles the Tresca criterion, which is |σ₁ - σ₂| ≤ σ_Y for certain cases but not general. Options C and D are incorrect as they consider only individual stresses."
