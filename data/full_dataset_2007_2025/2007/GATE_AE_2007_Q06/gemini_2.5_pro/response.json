        "reasoning": "For any continuous elastic system, such as an elastic beam, there are theoretically an infinite number of possible mode shapes and corresponding natural frequencies. The vibration analysis of a cantilever beam (fixed-free) involves solving the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, which leads to a transcendental frequency equation (e.g., $1 + \\cos(\\beta L) \\cosh(\\beta L) = 0$). This equation has an infinite number of roots for $\\beta L$, each corresponding to a distinct natural frequency. While numerical methods or finite element analysis can approximate a finite number of these frequencies, the underlying continuous model predicts an infinite set. This is a fundamental concept in the vibration of continuous systems."
