The governing partial differential equation, when solved via separation of variables, yields a characteristic (frequency) equation with an infinite number of roots (eigenvalues). Each root corresponds to a distinct natural frequency and mode shape. This is a fundamental theorem of continuous system vibrations. The cantilever (fixed-free) boundary conditions specify which infinite set of frequencies, but do not change the fact that the set is infinite. RAG chunks 1, 3, 4, and 6 all support this by discussing the transcendental frequency equation and its infinite solutions."

          "Step 1: Identify the system type. The question refers to an 'elastic beam', which is a continuous, distributed parameter system, not a discrete lumped mass system.",
          "Step 2: Recall the governing theory. The transverse vibration of a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam is described by a fourth-order partial differential equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left(EI\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}\\right) + \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} = 0$.",
          "Step 3: Apply separation of variables. Assuming a harmonic solution $w(x,t) = \\phi(x) e^{i\\omega t}$ leads to an ordinary differential equation for the mode shape $\\phi(x)$: $\\frac{d^4 \\phi}{dx^4} - \\beta^4 \\phi = 0$, where $\\beta^4 = \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{EI}$.",
          "Step 4: Apply boundary conditions. For a cantilever (fixed at x=0, free at x=L), we enforce: $\\phi(0)=0$, $\\phi'(0)=0$, $\\phi''(L)=0$, $\\phi'''(L)=0$. This yields a homogeneous system of equations for the constants in the general solution $\\phi(x)=A\\cosh(\\beta x)+B\\sinh(\\beta x)+C\\cos(\\beta x)+D\\sin(\\beta x)$.",
          "Step 5: Derive the frequency equation. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This leads to the transcendental equation: $1 + \\cos(\\beta_n L)\\cosh(\\beta_n L) = 0$ (as shown in RAG chunks 1, 3, 4).",
          "Step 6: Interpret the solutions. This transcendental equation has an infinite, countably infinite, number of roots $\\beta_n L$ (n=1,2,3,...∞). Each root $\\beta_n$ corresponds to a distinct natural frequency $\\omega_n = (\\beta_n)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude. Therefore, a continuous elastic beam, regardless of its boundary conditions (cantilever, simply-supported, free-free, etc.), possesses an infinite number of natural frequencies and mode shapes."

Chunks 1, 3, 4 explicitly detail the cantilever beam vibration analysis, derivation of the transcendental frequency equation (1+cosβL coshβL=0), and mention its infinite roots. Chunk 6 contrasts SDOF approximation with continuous systems, reinforcing the infinite-DOF concept. The RAG provided all necessary information to answer and explain the question confidently."
