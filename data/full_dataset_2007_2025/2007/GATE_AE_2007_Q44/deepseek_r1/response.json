From torsion theory, φ = (T_A L)/(G_A J_A) = (T_B L)/(G_B J_B), and total torque T = T_A + T_B. Solving, T_A = (G_A J_A / L) φ and T_B = (G_B J_B / L) φ, so T = [(G_A J_A + G_B J_B) / L] φ. Thus, torsional stiffness T/φ = (G_A J_A + G_B J_B) / L, matching option B. Option A is mathematically equivalent but written differently; B is the simplified form expected in GATE."
