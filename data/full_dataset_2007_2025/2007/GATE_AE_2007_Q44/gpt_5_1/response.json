The torque is shared between them: \\(T = T_A + T_B\\). For each material, \\(\\phi = \\dfrac{T_A L}{G_A J_A} = \\dfrac{T_B L}{G_B J_B}\\). Rearranging gives \\(T_A = \\dfrac{G_A J_A}{L} \\phi\\) and \\(T_B = \\dfrac{G_B J_B}{L} \\phi\\).

    "question_text": "A circular shaft is made-up of two materials A and B. The inner core is made-up of material A with diameter d_A, torsion constant J_A, and shear modulus G_A. The outer sleeve is made-up of material B with diameter d_B, torsion constant J_B, and shear modulus G_B. The composite shaft is of length L and is subjected to pure torsion moment T. The torsional stiffness, T/φ, where φ is the angle of twist, of this composite shaft is then"
