When subjected to a pure torsional moment `T`, the following conditions apply:\n\n1.  **Compatibility Condition**: Since the inner core and outer sleeve are rigidly connected and have the same length, they must undergo the same angle of twist `$\\phi$`. Therefore, `$\\phi_A = \\phi_B = \\phi$`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Condition**: The total applied torque `T` is shared between the inner core and the outer sleeve. Thus, `T = T_A + T_B`.\n\n3.  **Angle of Twist Formula**: For a single circular shaft, the angle of twist is given by `$\\phi = \\frac{T L}{G J}$` (from RAG Chunks 3, 4, 5, 6). Rearranging this, the torque `T` for a given angle of twist `$\\phi$` is `T = \\frac{G J \\phi}{L}$`.\n\nApplying this to each component:\n*   For material A: `T_A = \\frac{G_A J_A \\phi}{L}$`\n*   For material B: `T_B = \\frac{G_B J_B \\phi}{L}$`\n\nSubstitute these expressions for `T_A` and `T_B` into the equilibrium equation:\n`T = \\frac{G_A J_A \\phi}{L} + \\frac{G_B J_B \\phi}{L}$`\n\nFactor out `$\\frac{\\phi}{L}$`:\n`T = \\frac{\\phi}{L} (G_A J_A + G_B J_B)$`\n\nThe torsional stiffness is defined as `$\\frac{T}{\\phi}$`.\n`$\\frac{T}{\\phi} = \\frac{G_A J_A + G_B J_B}{L}$`\n\nThis matches option B."

          "Step 3: Define torsional stiffness. Torsional stiffness `k` is the ratio of applied torque to the resulting angle of twist, `k = T/\\phi$`. From the angle of twist formula, `k = \\frac{G J}{L}$`.",
          "Step 4: Apply the compatibility condition for composite shafts. Since the inner core and outer sleeve are rigidly connected and have the same length, they must experience the same angle of twist. So, `$\\phi_A = \\phi_B = \\phi$` (common angle of twist).",

    "question_text": "A circular shaft is made-up of two materials A and B. The inner core is made-up of material A with diameter d_A, torsion constant J_A, and shear modulus G_A. The outer sleeve is made-up of material B with diameter d_B, torsion constant J_B, and shear modulus G_B. The composite shaft is of length L and is subjected to pure torsion moment T. The torsional stiffness, T/φ, where φ is the angle of twist, of this composite shaft is then"
