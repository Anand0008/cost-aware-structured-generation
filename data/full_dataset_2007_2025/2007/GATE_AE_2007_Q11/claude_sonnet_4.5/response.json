        "reasoning": "The question states that the propeller is mounted on the nose of the fuselage. Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, a nose-mounted engine (or propeller) has a destabilizing effect on the longitudinal static stability of an aircraft. This is because the thrust from the engine creates a nose-up pitching moment that increases with angle of attack, which counteracts the stabilizing effect of the wing and horizontal tail. Therefore, the correct answer is that the longitudinal static stability decreases with a nose-mounted propeller."
