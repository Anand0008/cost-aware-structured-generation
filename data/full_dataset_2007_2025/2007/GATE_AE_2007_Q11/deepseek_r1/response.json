        "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. For a conventional airplane with a nose-mounted propeller (i.e., tractor configuration), the application of power (thrust) introduces an additional pitching moment. As explained in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2 & 3), this thrust-induced moment typically has a positive derivative with respect to angle of attack (dCm_thrust/dα > 0), which is destabilizing. A destabilizing contribution reduces the aircraft's overall static stability. Quantitatively, this shifts the stick-fixed neutral point (N0) forward. For a fixed center of gravity (CG) location, a forward shift of the neutral point reduces the static margin (distance between CG and N0), thereby decreasing longitudinal static stability. The RAG context directly supports this conclusion."

          "Step 1: Recall the fundamental criterion for longitudinal static stability: the slope of the pitching moment coefficient curve about the CG versus angle of attack must be negative (dCm_cg/dα < 0). A more negative slope indicates greater stability.",
          "Step 2: Understand that the neutral point (N0) is the aerodynamic center for the entire aircraft. The static margin is the distance between the CG and N0 (CG ahead of N0 for stability). A larger static margin means greater stability.",
          "Step 3: Recognize the effect of a nose-mounted propeller's thrust. The thrust line and the aerodynamic effects of the propeller slipstream create an additional pitching moment (Cm_thrust).",
          "Step 4: Apply the knowledge from stability theory (RAG Chunks 2 & 3): For a nose-mounted propeller, the derivative dCm_thrust/dα is usually positive. This means that as angle of attack increases, the thrust creates a nose-up pitching moment, which opposes the natural restoring moment.",
          "Step 5: Combine the effects. A positive dCm_thrust/dα is added to the total dCm_cg/dα. This makes the total slope less negative (or even positive), indicating reduced stability. This is equivalent to the neutral point moving forward.",
          "Step 6: Conclude: With a fixed CG, a forward shift of the neutral point reduces the static margin. Therefore, longitudinal static stability decreases when a propeller is mounted on the nose (under power-on conditions)."
