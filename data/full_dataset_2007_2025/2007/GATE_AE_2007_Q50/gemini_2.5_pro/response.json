        "reasoning": "The problem states that an athlete starts with an initial speed $V_0$, and subsequently, his speed decreases by an amount proportional to the distance he has already covered. Let $V(t)$ be the speed at time $t$, and $x(t)$ be the distance covered at time $t$. The initial condition is $x(0) = 0$.\n\nThe phrase 'his speed decreases by an amount that is proportional to the distance that he has already covered' implies that the current speed $V$ is equal to the initial speed $V_0$ minus a term proportional to the distance $x$. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n$V = V_0 - kx$\nwhere $k$ is a positive proportionality constant.\n\nWe also know that speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time:\n$V = \\frac{dx}{dt}$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $V$:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = V_0 - kx$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using the method of separation of variables:\n$\\frac{dx}{V_0 - kx} = dt$\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n$\\int \\frac{dx}{V_0 - kx} = \\int dt$\n\nTo integrate the left side, let $u = V_0 - kx$. Then $du = -k \\, dx$, which means $dx = -\\frac{1}{k} \\, du$.\n$\\int \\frac{-1/k \\, du}{u} = \\int dt$\n$-\\frac{1}{k} \\int \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = \\int dt$\n$-\\frac{1}{k} \\ln|u| = t + C_1$\n\nSubstitute $u = V_0 - kx$ back:\n$-\\frac{1}{k} \\ln|V_0 - kx| = t + C_1$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: at $t=0$, $x=0$.\n$-\\frac{1}{k} \\ln|V_0 - k(0)| = 0 + C_1$\n$C_1 = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln(V_0)$\n\nSubstitute $C_1$ back into the equation:\n$-\\frac{1}{k} \\ln|V_0 - kx| = t - \\frac{1}{k} \\ln(V_0)$\n\nMultiply by $-k$:\n$\\ln|V_0 - kx| = -kt + \\ln(V_0)$\n\nRearrange the logarithmic terms:\n$\\ln|V_0 - kx| - \\ln(V_0) = -kt$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{|V_0 - kx|}{V_0}\\right) = -kt$\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n$\\frac{|V_0 - kx|}{V_0} = e^{-kt}$\n\nSince the athlete starts with speed $V_0$ and the speed decreases, $V_0 - kx$ will remain positive as long as the athlete is moving forward (i.e., $V > 0$). Thus, we can remove the absolute value sign.\n$V_0 - kx = V_0 e^{-kt}$\n\nNow, solve for $x(t)$:\n$kx = V_0 - V_0 e^{-kt}$\n$x(t) = \\frac{V_0}{k} (1 - e^{-kt})$\n\nThis equation shows that the distance covered $x(t)$ is an exponential function of time. As $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{-kt} \\to 0$, and $x(t)$ approaches a limiting distance of $\\frac{V_0}{k}$. Therefore, the distance covered will be exponential in time."

        "step_by_step": [
          "**Step 1: Interpret the problem statement and define variables.** Let $V(t)$ be the athlete's speed and $x(t)$ be the distance covered at time $t$. The initial speed is $V_0$, and the initial distance is $x(0)=0$. The core statement is 'speed decreases by an amount that is proportional to the distance that he has already covered'.",
          "**Step 2: Formulate the governing equation for speed.** Based on the interpretation, the current speed $V$ is the initial speed $V_0$ minus a term proportional to the distance $x$. This translates to $V = V_0 - kx$, where $k$ is a positive proportionality constant.",
          "**Step 3: Relate speed to distance and time.** Recall the definition of speed as the derivative of distance with respect to time: $V = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.",
          "**Step 4: Set up the differential equation.** Substitute the expression for $V$ from Step 2 into the definition from Step 3: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = V_0 - kx$.",
          "**Step 5: Solve the differential equation using separation of variables.** Rearrange the equation to separate $x$ and $t$ terms: $\\frac{dx}{V_0 - kx} = dt$.",
          "**Step 6: Integrate both sides.** Integrate $\\int \\frac{dx}{V_0 - kx}$ (which yields $-\\frac{1}{k} \\ln|V_0 - kx|$) and $\\int dt$ (which yields $t + C_1$, where $C_1$ is the integration constant).",
          "**Step 7: Apply initial conditions to find the integration constant.** Use $x(0)=0$ at $t=0$ to solve for $C_1$. This gives $C_1 = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln(V_0)$.",
          "**Step 8: Substitute $C_1$ back and simplify to find $x(t)$.** Substitute $C_1$ into the integrated equation and use properties of logarithms and exponentials to isolate $x(t)$. The final form is $x(t) = \\frac{V_0}{k} (1 - e^{-kt})$.",
          "**Step 9: Identify the functional form.** The derived expression $x(t) = \\frac{V_0}{k} (1 - e^{-kt})$ clearly shows that the distance covered is an exponential function of time."
