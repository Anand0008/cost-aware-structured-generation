        "reasoning": "The athlete's speed decreases proportionally to the distance covered. Mathematically, if $x(t)$ is distance, then speed $v(t) = dx/dt$. The rate of decrease of speed is given as $dv/dt = -k x$, where $k$ is a positive constant of proportionality. This leads to the second-order differential equation $d^2x/dt^2 + k x = 0$. However, the initial condition $v(0) = V_0$ and $x(0) = 0$ suggests a first-order relationship is more directly interpretable: $v = V_0 - \\alpha x$, which implies $dx/dt = V_0 - \\alpha x$. Solving this first-order linear ODE yields an exponential solution for $x(t)$. Both interpretations (if correctly solved with given initial conditions) lead to an exponential form, confirming option C."
