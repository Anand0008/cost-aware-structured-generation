        "reasoning": "Let the athlete's speed be v and distance covered be x. The statement \"speed decreases by an amount that is proportional to the distance already covered\" implies a relation of the form v = v_0 - k x, where k > 0 is a constant of proportionality. Since v = dx/dt, we get the first-order linear ODE: dx/dt = v_0 - k x. Separating variables: dx/(v_0 - k x) = dt. Integrating: -(1/k) \\ln|v_0 - k x| = t + C. Applying initial condition x = 0 at t = 0 gives C = -(1/k) \\ln v_0. Rearranging: \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_0}{v_0 - k x}\\right) = k t. Exponentiating: \\frac{v_0}{v_0 - k x} = e^{k t}. Solving for x(t): v_0 - k x = v_0 e^{-k t} \\Rightarrow x(t) = \\frac{v_0}{k} \\left(1 - e^{-k t}\\right). This is an exponential approach to a finite limit, so the distance is an exponential function of time, matching option C. It is neither linear, quadratic, nor logarithmic in t."
