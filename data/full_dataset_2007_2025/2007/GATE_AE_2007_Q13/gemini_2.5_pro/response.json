        "reasoning": "For a plane strain problem in the x-y plane, the defining conditions are that the normal strain perpendicular to the plane and all shear strains associated with that perpendicular direction are zero. Specifically, these conditions are: \\n1. $\\epsilon_z = 0$ (normal strain in the z-direction is zero)\\n2. $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$ (shear strain in the xz-plane is zero)\\n3. $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$ (shear strain in the yz-plane is zero)\\n\\nNow, let's relate these zero strains to the corresponding stress components using Hooke's Law for an isotropic material:\\n*   **Shear Stresses ($\\sigma_{xz}$, $\\sigma_{yz}$):**\\n    *   Since $\\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\tau_{xz}}{G}$ (or $\\frac{\\sigma_{xz}}{G}$) and $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$, it implies that $\\tau_{xz} = 0$ (or $\\sigma_{xz} = 0$), assuming the shear modulus $G \\neq 0$.\\n    *   Similarly, since $\\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\tau_{yz}}{G}$ (or $\\frac{\\sigma_{yz}}{G}$) and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$, it implies that $\\tau_{yz} = 0$ (or $\\sigma_{yz} = 0$).\\n    Therefore, $\\sigma_{xz}$ and $\\sigma_{yz}$ are zero.\\n\\n*   **Normal Stress ($\\sigma_{zz}$):**\\n    *   From the generalized Hooke's Law, $\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)]$. Since $\\epsilon_z = 0$, we have:\\n        $0 = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)]$\\n        This simplifies to $\\sigma_z = \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$.\\n    *   Since $\\sigma_x$ (or $\\sigma_{xx}$) and $\\sigma_y$ (or $\\sigma_{yy}$) are generally non-zero due to in-plane loading, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ is also generally non-zero, it follows that $\\sigma_z$ (or $\\sigma_{zz}$) is generally **non-zero** in a plane strain condition.

For a plane strain condition in the x-y plane, the normal strain in the z-direction and all shear strains involving the z-direction are assumed to be zero.

          "Step 2: Apply Hooke's Law to relate the zero shear strains to shear stresses. For an isotropic material, $\\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\tau_{xz}}{G}$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\tau_{yz}}{G}$. Since $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$, it implies that $\\tau_{xz} = 0$ (or $\\sigma_{xz} = 0$) and $\\tau_{yz} = 0$ (or $\\sigma_{yz} = 0$).",
