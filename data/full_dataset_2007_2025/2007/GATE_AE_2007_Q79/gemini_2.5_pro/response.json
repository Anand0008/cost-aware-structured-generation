        "reasoning": "The span efficiency factor ($e$) is calculated using the relationship between the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_{0,deg}$) and the 3D wing lift curve slope ($a_{wing,deg}$), derived from Prandtl's lifting line theory. First, the wing's aspect ratio ($AR$) is calculated from its geometry. Then, the wing's lift coefficient ($C_L$) is determined from the given lift, velocity, density, and wing area. From $C_L$ and the angle of attack, the actual wing lift curve slope ($a_{wing,deg}$) is found. Finally, these values are substituted into the formula $a_{wing,deg} = \\frac{a_{0,deg}}{1 + \\frac{a_{0,deg} \\times 180}{\\pi^2 AR e}}$ to solve for $e$. The calculated value of $e \\approx 0.91189$ closely matches option B (0.91)."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the given data and calculate the wing's geometric properties. The wing has a rectangular planform with chord ($c$) = 0.2 m and span ($b$) = 1.2 m. The wing area is $S = b \\times c = 1.2 \\times 0.2 = 0.24 \\text{ m}^2$. The aspect ratio is $AR = b/c = 1.2/0.2 = 6$. The airfoil lift curve slope ($a_{0,deg}$) is 0.1 per degree, angle of attack ($\\alpha_{deg}$) is 8 degrees, freestream velocity ($V$) is 20 m/s, lift ($L$) is 35.3 N, and air density ($\\rho$) is 1.225 kg/m³.",
          "Step 2: Calculate the wing's lift coefficient ($C_L$). Use the lift equation: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. Rearranging for $C_L$: $C_L = \\frac{L}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S}$. Substituting the values: $C_L = \\frac{35.3 \\text{ N}}{0.5 \\times 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (20 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\times 0.24 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{35.3}{58.8} \\approx 0.60034$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the wing's actual lift curve slope ($a_{wing,deg}$). For a symmetric airfoil, the zero-lift angle of attack is 0 degrees. Therefore, $C_L = a_{wing,deg} \\times \\alpha_{deg}$. Rearranging for $a_{wing,deg}$: $a_{wing,deg} = \\frac{C_L}{\\alpha_{deg}} = \\frac{0.60034}{8 \\text{ deg}} \\approx 0.07504 \\text{ per degree}$. (This value is the answer to the linked question Q78).",
          "Step 4: Apply the formula relating the 2D airfoil lift curve slope to the 3D wing lift curve slope, incorporating the span efficiency factor. The formula, accounting for $a_{0,deg}$ and $a_{wing,deg}$ in per degree, is: $a_{wing,deg} = \\frac{a_{0,deg}}{1 + \\frac{a_{0,deg} \\times 180}{\\pi^2 AR e}}$.",
          "Step 5: Solve the equation for the span efficiency factor ($e$). Substitute the known values: $0.07504 = \\frac{0.1}{1 + \\frac{0.1 \\times 180}{\\pi^2 \\times 6 \\times e}}$. Simplify the equation: $1 + \\frac{18}{6 \\pi^2 e} = \\frac{0.1}{0.07504} \\approx 1.3326$. This simplifies to $1 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} \\approx 1.3326$. Further simplification yields $\\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} \\approx 0.3326$. Solving for $e$: $e = \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 \\times 0.3326} \\approx \\frac{9.0207}{\\pi^2} \\approx \\frac{9.0207}{9.8696} \\approx 0.9139$. Using the exact fraction $\\frac{4}{3}$ for $\\frac{0.1}{0.075}$: $1 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} = \\frac{4}{3} \\implies \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies \\pi^2 e = 9 \\implies e = \\frac{9}{\\pi^2} \\approx 0.91189$. Rounding to two decimal places, $e \\approx 0.91$."
