Aspect Ratio AR = b²/S = (1.2)²/0.24 = 6. Airfoil lift curve slope a0 = 0.1 per degree. From Q78 context, the finite wing lift curve slope 'a' is derived. Based on the calculation path and typical results, a = 0.075 per degree (Option C from Q78).",

This formula stems from lifting line theory, where the induced angle of attack reduces the effective angle of attack.",

        "notes": "RAG context provided excellent theoretical background on the span efficiency factor (e), its definition via Fourier coefficients, its relationship to induced drag, and the distinction from Oswald efficiency. However, it did not contain the specific formula linking 'e' to the finite wing lift curve slope ($a = a_0/(1 + a_0/(\\pi e AR))$) which is central to solving this particular problem. This gap was filled using internal knowledge. The RAG was still highly relevant for conceptual understanding."
