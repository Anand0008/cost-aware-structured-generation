The steps involve calculating the spring stiffness (k) from the static deflection, then determining the natural frequency ($\\omega_n$), and finally applying the given initial conditions (initial displacement and zero initial velocity) to the general solution of undamped free vibration.\n\n1.  **Calculate spring stiffness (k):**\n    Given: mass $m = 1 \\text{ kg}$, static elongation $\\Delta x_{st} = 16 \\text{ mm} = 0.016 \\text{ m}$, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n    At static equilibrium, the spring force balances the gravitational force:\n    $k \\Delta x_{st} = m g$\n    $k = \\frac{m g}{\\Delta x_{st}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}{0.016 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{9.81}{0.016} = 613.125 \\text{ N/m}$\n\n2.  **Calculate natural circular frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    For an undamped spring-mass system, the natural frequency is:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{613.125 \\text{ N/m}}{1 \\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{613.125} \\approx 24.7614 \\text{ rad/s}$\n\n3.  **Determine initial conditions:**\n    The mass is pulled from its equilibrium position by $10 \\text{ mm}$ and released from rest.\n    Initial displacement: $x(0) = 10 \\text{ mm}$\n    Initial velocity: $\\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\text{ mm/s}$\n\n4.  **General solution for undamped free vibration:**\n    The general solution for $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$ is $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega_n t) + B \\sin(\\omega_n t)$.\n\n5.  **Apply initial conditions to find A and B:**\n    *   At $t=0$, $x(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A$. Since $x(0) = 10 \\text{ mm}$, we get $A = 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n    *   Differentiate $x(t)$ to find velocity: $\\dot{x}(t) = -A\\omega_n \\sin(\\omega_n t) + B\\omega_n \\cos(\\omega_n t)$.\n    *   At $t=0$, $\\dot{x}(0) = -A\\omega_n \\sin(0) + B\\omega_n \\cos(0) = B\\omega_n$. Since $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$, we have $B\\omega_n = 0$. As $\\omega_n \\neq 0$, it implies $B = 0$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final response:**\n    Substitute $A = 10 \\text{ mm}$, $B = 0$, and $\\omega_n \\approx 24.76 \\text{ rad/s}$ into the general solution:\n    $x(t) = 10 \\cos(24.76 t) \\text{ mm}$\n\nThis matches option B."
