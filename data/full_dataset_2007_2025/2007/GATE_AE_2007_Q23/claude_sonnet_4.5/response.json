        "reasoning": "The given information can be used to derive the equation of motion for the mass-spring system and solve for the response. The key steps are:\n\n1. The mass `m` is 1 kg, and the spring elongates by 16 mm under the weight of the mass. Using Hooke's law, the spring stiffness `k` can be calculated as:\n   `k = mg / delta_st = 1 * 9.81 / 0.016 = 612.5 N/m`\n\n2. The mass is pulled 10 mm from the equilibrium position and released from rest. The initial displacement `u0` is 10 mm or 0.01 m.\n\n3. The equation of motion for an undamped mass-spring system is:\n   `m * x'' + k * x = 0`\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   `1 * x'' + 612.5 * x = 0`\n   Dividing by `m`, the natural frequency `omega_n` is:\n   `omega_n = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(612.5/1) = 24.76 rad/s`\n\n4. The general solution for the free vibration of an undamped mass-spring system is:\n   `x(t) = x_0 * cos(omega_n * t) + (v_0 / omega_n) * sin(omega_n * t)`\n   Where `x_0` is the initial displacement (0.01 m) and `v_0` is the initial velocity (0 m/s).\n\n5. Substituting the values, the response is:\n   `x(t) = 0.01 * cos(24.76 * t) + 0 * sin(24.76 * t)`\n   `x(t) = 0.01 * cos(24.76 * t)`\n\nThus, the correct answer is option B: `x = 10 cos 24.76t`."
