        "reasoning": "To find the natural frequencies of a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, we need to derive its equations of motion, form the mass ([M]) and stiffness ([K]) matrices, and then solve the characteristic equation `det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0`. \\n\\n**1. Equations of Motion (EOMs):**\\nLet $x_1$ be the displacement of mass $m$ and $x_2$ be the displacement of mass $3m$. We assume positive displacement to the right.\\n\\n*   **For mass $m$:**\\n    Forces acting on $m$: \\n    - From left spring $k$: $-k x_1$ (restoring force)\\n    - From middle spring $k$: $k (x_2 - x_1)$ (relative displacement)\\n    Using Newton's second law: $m \\ddot{x}_1 = -k x_1 + k (x_2 - x_1)$ \\n    $m \\ddot{x}_1 + 2k x_1 - k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 1)\\n\\n*   **For mass $3m$:**\\n    Forces acting on $3m$: \\n    - From middle spring $k$: $-k (x_2 - x_1)$ (relative displacement, opposite to $m$)\\n    - From right spring $k$: $-k x_2$ (restoring force)\\n    Using Newton's second law: $3m \\ddot{x}_2 = -k (x_2 - x_1) - k x_2$ \\n    $3m \\ddot{x}_2 - k x_1 + 2k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 2)\\n\\n**2. Matrix Formulation:**\\nAssume a harmonic solution of the form $x_1 = A_1 \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $x_2 = A_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$. \\nThen $\\ddot{x}_1 = -\\omega^2 A_1 \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $\\ddot{x}_2 = -\\omega^2 A_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\\nSubstitute these into the EOMs and cancel $\\sin(\\omega t)$:\\n$(2k - m\\omega^2) A_1 - k A_2 = 0$\\n$-k A_1 + (2k - 3m\\omega^2) A_2 = 0$\\n\\nThis can be written in matrix form as $([K] - \\omega^2[M])\\{A\\} = \\{0\\}$, where:\\n$[K] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2k & -k \\ -k & 2k \\end{bmatrix}$ (Stiffness Matrix)\\n$[M] = \\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 \\ 0 & 3m \\end{bmatrix}$ (Mass Matrix)\\n\\n**3. Characteristic Equation:**\\nFor non-trivial solutions (i.e., amplitudes $A_1, A_2$ are not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\\n$\\det\\begin{bmatrix} 2k - m\\omega^2 & -k \\ -k & 2k - 3m\\omega^2 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\\n\\n**4. Solving the Determinant:**\\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)(2k - 3m\\omega^2) - (-k)(-k) = 0$\\n$4k^2 - 6mk\\omega^2 - 2mk\\omega^2 + 3m^2\\omega^4 - k^2 = 0$\\n$3m^2\\omega^4 - 8mk\\omega^2 + 3k^2 = 0$\\n\\n**5. Solving for $\\omega^2$ (Eigenvalues):**\\nLet $\\lambda = \\omega^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $\\lambda$:\\n$3m^2\\lambda^2 - 8mk\\lambda + 3k^2 = 0$\\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{(-8mk)^2 - 4(3m^2)(3k^2)}}{2(3m^2)}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{64m^2k^2 - 36m^2k^2}}{6m^2}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{28m^2k^2}}{6m^2}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm mk\\sqrt{28}}{6m^2}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm mk(2\\sqrt{7})}{6m^2}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2mk(4 \\pm \\sqrt{7})}{6m^2}$\\n$\\lambda = \\frac{(4 \\pm \\sqrt{7})k}{3m}$\\n\\n**6.

          "description": "Lagrange's equations provide a systematic way to derive equations of motion for complex systems, especially when generalized coordinates are used or when dealing with constraints. It involves calculating kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V) and applying the formula $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q_i} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_i} = Q_i$, where $q_i$ are generalized coordinates and $Q_i$ are non-conservative forces.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: More systematic, handles complex geometries and constraints easily, often less prone to sign errors than Newton's method for complex systems. Cons: Can be more computationally intensive for simple systems, requires good understanding of energy principles.",

Chunks 1, 2, 4, and 5 were particularly relevant, outlining the step-by-step process and the use of the quadratic formula for 2-DOF systems. While the specific mass and stiffness matrices in the RAG examples differed from the question, the underlying principles and derivation steps were directly applicable and highly helpful."
