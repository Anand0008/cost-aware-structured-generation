        "reasoning": "In a biplane configuration, the two wings are in close proximity. The flow field around each wing is altered due to the presence of the other. The constriction of the streamlines between the wings leads to an increased flow velocity (Bernoulli/continuity effect), meaning each airfoil experiences an increased approach velocity relative to the freestream. Furthermore, the circulation (lift) generated by each wing induces an upward-directed velocity component (upwash) on the other wing. For two wings with positive lift, the mutual interference typically results in an upwash on both wings, increasing their effective angles of attack. This aligns with option A. Options B and C incorrectly suggest downwash or asymmetric velocity changes. Option D is false because the incidence (effective angle of attack) is altered by interference."

For two wings producing lift in the same sense (positive lift), the induced vertical velocity component on each other is generally upward (upwash). This upwash increases the local effective angle of attack.",
