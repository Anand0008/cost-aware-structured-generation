        "reasoning": "Each lifting airfoil can be modeled as a bound vortex of circulation \\(\\Gamma\\). A lifting wing induces an upwash ahead of it and a downwash behind it. In the biplane, the two wings are staggered but both are at the same positive incidence and both generate positive lift (positive \\(\\Gamma\\)). The lower wing A lies in the upwash field induced by the upper wing B (it is ahead of B in the sense of the induced field), and the upper wing B lies in the upwash field induced by the lower wing A. Thus, the local flow approaching each wing is tilted slightly upward relative to the freestream, which increases the effective incidence and therefore the local approach speed magnitude over the airfoil sections. Hence both airfoils experience upwash and an increased approach velocity. Options B and C incorrectly state downwash or mixed effects, and D is wrong because induced velocities do alter effective incidence."

          "Step 3: In a biplane, each wing is a lifting element. Therefore, each wing lies partly in the induced velocity field of the other wing.",
          "Step 4: Consider the lower wing A. The upper wing B is located somewhat downstream and above A. The bound vortex of B induces an upward velocity component (upwash) at the location of A, tilting the local flow upward relative to the freestream.",
          "Step 5: Similarly, the bound vortex of A induces an upward velocity component at the location of B (since B is ahead of A in the sense of the induced field), so B also experiences upwash.",
          "Step 6: This upwash increases the effective angle between the local relative wind and the chord for both wings, which is equivalent to an increased effective incidence and an increased approach velocity magnitude over the airfoil sections.",
          "Step 7: Therefore, the correct qualitative statement is that both airfoils experience an upwash and an increased approach velocity, corresponding to option A."
