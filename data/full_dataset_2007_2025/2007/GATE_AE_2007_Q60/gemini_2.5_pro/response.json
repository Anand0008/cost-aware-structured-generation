        "reasoning": "In a biplane configuration, the aerodynamic interaction between the two wings (airfoils A and B) is characterized by mutual induction. Each wing's circulation and associated vortex system induce a velocity field that affects the other wing. \n\n1.  **Induced Flow (Upwash/Downwash):** The bound vortex and trailing vortices of one wing induce an upward component of velocity (upwash) on the other wing. Specifically, the upper wing (B) induces an upwash on the lower wing (A), and the lower wing (A) induces an upwash on the upper wing (B). This upwash effectively increases the local angle of attack for both airfoils, leading to higher lift for a given geometric angle of attack compared to what would be expected from isolated wings experiencing only downwash from their own trailing vortices. Therefore, both airfoils experience an upwash.\n\n2.  **Approach Velocity:** The presence of two lifting surfaces in close proximity, both generating lift, significantly alters the local flow field. The combined circulation fields of the two airfoils cause the flow *between* them to accelerate. This acceleration results in a higher local velocity, meaning both airfoils experience an increased approach velocity compared to the free stream velocity if they were isolated. This increased velocity, coupled with the upwash, contributes to the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the biplane.\n\nBased on these principles, statement A, 'Both the airfoils experience an upwash and an increased approach velocity,' is the correct description of the aerodynamic interaction in a biplane."

          "Step 1: Understand the biplane configuration. The question presents two identical airfoil sections, A and B, arranged vertically with a separation 'h' and both operating at an incidence '$\\alpha$' in a uniform stream $U_\\infty$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the concept of induced flow for multiple lifting surfaces. When two lifting surfaces are in close proximity, the flow field generated by one surface (its bound vortex and trailing vortices) affects the other surface.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the induced flow (upwash/downwash) on each airfoil. For a biplane, the bound vortex and trailing vortices of the upper wing (B) induce an upward velocity component (upwash) on the lower wing (A). Similarly, the bound vortex and trailing vortices of the lower wing (A) induce an upwash on the upper wing (B). This mutual induction leads to both airfoils experiencing an upwash.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect on approach velocity. The combined circulation around both airfoils in a biplane configuration leads to an acceleration of the flow in the region between the two wings. This means that the local velocity experienced by both airfoils is greater than the free stream velocity $U_\\infty$.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis. Option A states both airfoils experience an upwash and an increased approach velocity, which aligns with the aerodynamic principles of biplanes. Options B, C, and D are inconsistent with these principles."
