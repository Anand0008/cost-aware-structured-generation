        "reasoning": "The horizontal tail volume ratio ($V_H$) is a key parameter influencing both longitudinal static stability and elevator control power. $V_H = (S_T L_T) / (S c)$, where $S_T$ is horizontal tail area, $L_T$ is tail moment arm, $S$ is wing area, and $c$ is mean aerodynamic chord. Increasing $S_T$ increases $V_H$. (1) Longitudinal static stability: The tail's stabilizing contribution is proportional to $V_H$. A larger $V_H$ makes the aircraft more statically stable (increases the static margin). (2) Elevator control power: The elevator effectiveness derivative $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$ (or $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$) is given by $C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = -\\eta V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_t}} \\tau$. Increasing $V_H$ directly increases the magnitude of $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$, meaning more pitching moment per degree of elevator deflection, i.e., increased control power. Keeping the elevator-to-tail area ratio constant means the elevator's relative size and its effectiveness parameter $\\tau$ remain unchanged, so the change is solely due to the increased tail area and its associated increase in $V_H$. Therefore, both stability and control power increase."

          "Step 2: Understand the effect of increasing horizontal tail area ($S_T$). With other parameters ($L_T$, $S$, $c$) held constant, increasing $S_T$ directly increases $V_H$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the formula for longitudinal static stability. The static margin (a measure of stability) has a contribution from the tail proportional to $V_H$. A larger $V_H$ means a more negative slope of the pitching moment curve vs. angle of attack ($C_{m_\\alpha}$), indicating increased static stability.",
          "Step 4: Recall the formula for elevator control power: $C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = -\\eta V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_t}} \\tau$, where $\\eta$ is tail efficiency factor, $C_{L_{\\alpha_t}}$ is tail lift curve slope, and $\\tau$ is elevator effectiveness. $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$ quantifies the pitching moment generated per unit elevator deflection.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the effect of increased $V_H$ on $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$. Since $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$ is directly proportional to $V_H$, increasing $V_H$ increases the magnitude of $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$, meaning greater control authority (more pitching moment for the same elevator input).",
          "Step 6: Consider the constraint: 'elevator to horizontal tail area ratio is kept same.' This means the elevator is scaled proportionally with the tail. The parameter $\\tau$ (which depends on elevator chord ratio) remains approximately constant, so the change in control power comes solely from the increased $V_H$.",
          "Step 7: Synthesize: Increasing $S_T$ increases $V_H$. Increased $V_H$ leads to increased longitudinal static stability and increased elevator control power. Hence, option A is correct."
