This means the tail volume ratio (VH) will increase, as VH is proportional to the horizontal tail area (ST). \n\nFrom the formulas and concepts provided in the RAG context, we know that a larger VH leads to:\n1. Increased longitudinal static stability, as the horizontal tail provides more stabilizing pitching moment.\n2. Increased elevator control power (CM_delta_e), as the larger tail area and longer moment arm provide more leverage for the elevator to generate pitching moments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, where both longitudinal static stability and elevator control power will increase."
