        "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability depends strongly on the horizontal tail volume ratio V_H = (S_t l_t)/(S c). Increasing horizontal tail area S_t (with all other geometric terms fixed) increases V_H, which increases the stabilizing tail contribution to dC_M/d\\alpha, hence improves longitudinal static stability. Elevator control power is governed by C_{M_{\\delta_e}} = - \\eta_t V_H C_{L_{\\alpha t}} \\tau. With elevator-to-tail area ratio kept constant, increasing S_t increases V_H while preserving elevator effectiveness parameter \\tau and tail lift-curve slope C_{L_{\\alpha t}}. Therefore |C_{M_{\\delta_e}}| increases, giving greater elevator control power. Thus both stability and control power increase, matching option A."
