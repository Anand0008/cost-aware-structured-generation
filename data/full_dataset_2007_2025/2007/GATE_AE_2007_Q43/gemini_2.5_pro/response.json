        "reasoning": "The question asks about the impact of increasing horizontal tail area ($S_T$) on longitudinal static stability and elevator control power, while keeping the elevator to horizontal tail area ratio constant. Let's analyze each aspect:\n\n1.  **Longitudinal Static Stability:**\n    *   Longitudinal static stability is primarily determined by the aircraft's pitching moment characteristics, particularly the slope of the pitching moment coefficient with respect to angle of attack ($C_{M_\\alpha}$). A more negative $C_{M_\\alpha}$ indicates greater static stability.\n    *   The horizontal tail's contribution is crucial for longitudinal stability. Its effectiveness is largely quantified by the horizontal tail volume ratio ($V_H$).\n    *   The formula for horizontal tail volume ratio is $V_H = \\frac{S_T L_T}{S c}$, where $S_T$ is horizontal tail area, $L_T$ is tail moment arm, $S$ is wing reference area, and $c$ is mean aerodynamic chord (Chunk 1, 3, 4, 6).\n    *   If $S_T$ is increased, and other parameters ($L_T, S, c$) remain constant, then $V_H$ will increase.\n    *   A larger $V_H$ provides greater leverage for the tail to generate restoring moments, thus increasing longitudinal static stability (Chunk 3, 4).\n\n2.  **Elevator Control Power:**\n    *   Elevator control power is represented by the pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to elevator deflection, $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$. A larger magnitude of $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ indicates greater control power.\n    *   The formula for $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is given as $C_{M_{\\delta_e}} = - \\eta_t V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_T}} \\tau$ (Chunk 1, 3, 6), where $\\eta_t$ is the dynamic pressure ratio at the tail, $C_{L_{\\alpha_T}}$ is the lift curve slope of the horizontal tail, and $\\tau$ is the elevator effectiveness parameter.\n    *   The problem states that the elevator to horizontal tail area ratio is kept the same. This implies that $\\tau$ (which depends on the elevator chord ratio) and $C_{L_{\\alpha_T}}$ (which depends on the tail airfoil and aspect ratio) are likely to remain constant or scale appropriately with $S_T$ such that the overall effectiveness per unit tail area is maintained. The key factor here is $V_H$.\n    *   As established, increasing $S_T$ leads to an increase in $V_H$.\n    *   Since $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is directly proportional to $V_H$ (in magnitude), an increase in $V_H$ will lead to an increase in the magnitude of $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$, thereby increasing elevator control power (Chunk 1, 3, 6).\n\nTherefore, increasing the horizontal tail area will increase both longitudinal static stability and elevator control power."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the parameters involved. The question asks about the impact of increasing horizontal tail area ($S_T$) on two key flight mechanics characteristics: longitudinal static stability and elevator control power.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition and significance of the horizontal tail volume ratio ($V_H$). The horizontal tail volume ratio is a non-dimensional parameter defined as $V_H = \\frac{S_T L_T}{S c}$, where $S_T$ is the horizontal tail area, $L_T$ is the tail moment arm, $S$ is the wing reference area, and $c$ is the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of increasing $S_T$ on $V_H$. If $S_T$ is increased while other parameters ($L_T, S, c$) are kept constant, the horizontal tail volume ratio ($V_H$) will increase.",
          "Step 4: Relate $V_H$ to longitudinal static stability. A larger horizontal tail volume ratio ($V_H$) implies greater leverage for the horizontal tail to generate pitching moments. This directly contributes to increased longitudinal static stability, as the tail's ability to restore the aircraft to a trimmed condition is enhanced (Chunks 3, 4).",
          "Step 5: Relate $V_H$ to elevator control power. Elevator control power is quantified by the pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to elevator deflection ($C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$). The formula for this is $C_{M_{\\delta_e}} = - \\eta_t V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_T}} \\tau$ (Chunks 1, 3, 6).",
          "Step 6: Analyze the effect of increasing $S_T$ on $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$. Since $S_T$ increases $V_H$, and $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is directly proportional to $V_H$ (in magnitude), an increase in $V_H$ will lead to an increase in the magnitude of $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$. This means the elevator will be able to generate a larger pitching moment for a given deflection, thus increasing elevator control power (Chunks 1, 3, 6). The condition 'elevator to horizontal tail area ratio is kept same' ensures that the elevator's effectiveness relative to the tail ($\\tau$) does not diminish, allowing the increased tail area to translate directly to increased control power.",
          "Step 7: Conclude the combined effect. Both longitudinal static stability and elevator control power will increase."
