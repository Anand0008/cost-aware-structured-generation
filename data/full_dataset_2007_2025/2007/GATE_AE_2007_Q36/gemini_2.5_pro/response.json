First, the Indicated Airspeed (IAS) must be converted to True Airspeed (TAS) using the ratio of sea-level density to local density. Second, the static pressure at the given altitude needs to be calculated using the Ideal Gas Law. Finally, Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow is applied to find the stagnation pressure. Following these steps with the given values leads to a stagnation pressure of approximately $2.8796 \\times 10^4$ N/m², which matches option C."

          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. We are given the altitude (10 km), ambient temperature ($T = 223$ K), local air density ($\\rho = 0.413$ kg/m³), Indicated Airspeed (IAS = 60 m/s), standard sea-level density ($\\rho_{SL} = 1.225$ kg/m³), and the gas constant ($R = 288$ J/kg/K). The goal is to find the stagnation pressure ($P_0$).",
          "Step 2: Convert the Indicated Airspeed (IAS) to True Airspeed ($V_{true}$). The airspeed indicator is calibrated for standard sea-level density. The relationship between TAS and IAS is given by $V_{true} = IAS \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{SL}}{\\rho}}$. Substitute the given values: $V_{true} = 60 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{0.413 \\text{ kg/m}^3}} = 60 \\times \\sqrt{2.966} \\approx 60 \\times 1.722 \\approx 103.32 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the static pressure ($p$) at the given altitude. Use the Ideal Gas Law: $p = \\rho R T$. Substitute the local density, gas constant, and ambient temperature: $p = 0.413 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 288 \\text{ J/(kg\\cdot K)} \\times 223 \\text{ K} \\approx 26592.35 \\text{ N/m}^2$.",
          "Step 4: Apply Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow to find the stagnation pressure ($P_0$). Bernoulli's equation states that $P_0 = p + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_{true}^2$. Substitute the calculated static pressure, local density, and true airspeed: $P_0 = 26592.35 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.413 \\times (103.32)^2$.",
          "Step 5: Complete the calculation for stagnation pressure. $P_0 = 26592.35 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.413 \\times 10675.02 \\approx 26592.35 + 2204.07 \\approx 28796.42 \\text{ N/m}^2$. This value is approximately $2.8796 \\times 10^4 \\text{ N/m}^2$, which corresponds to option C."
