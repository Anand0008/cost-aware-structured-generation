These directly informed the formulas and conceptual steps used in the solution. However, none of the chunks explicitly solve the exact problem type where you start with IAS and must find P0 at altitude using the ideal gas law for static pressure. Therefore, internal knowledge was required to synthesize the steps (combine ideal gas law with the instrument calibration principle)."
