To find the cube root of a positive number $c$, we need to solve the equation $x = c^{1/3}$, which can be rewritten as $x^3 = c$, or $f(x) = x^3 - c = 0$. The derivative of this function is $f'(x) = 3x^2$. The Newton-Raphson iteration formula is given by $x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$. Substituting $f(x_k)$ and $f'(x_k)$ into the formula: $x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{x_k^3 - c}{3x_k^2}$. To simplify, find a common denominator: $x_{k+1} = \\frac{x_k \\cdot (3x_k^2) - (x_k^3 - c)}{3x_k^2} = \\frac{3x_k^3 - x_k^3 + c}{3x_k^2} = \\frac{2x_k^3 + c}{3x_k^2}$. This matches option C."
