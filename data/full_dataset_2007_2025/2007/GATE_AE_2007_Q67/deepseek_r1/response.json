        "reasoning": "The system has a solid wall B. At design condition (p₁ = p_d), the expansion fan from A is completely absorbed, meaning the flow becomes parallel to wall B upon reaching it, so no reflection occurs. For off-design conditions (p₁ ≠ p_d), a reflection occurs. The key principle from gas dynamics is that for a solid wall boundary condition (flow must be parallel to the wall), an incident expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave (to turn the flow back to be parallel). Therefore, for both p₁ < p_d and p₁ > p_d, the reflection from wall B should be an expansion wave. Option A states that for p₁ < p_d, the reflection is a compression wave, which contradicts the solid wall reflection rule. Hence, option A is NOT true."

(ii) For a constant pressure (free) boundary, an incident expansion wave reflects as a compression wave. This is directly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 & 2).",
          "Step 3: Understand the design condition. The expansion fan is completely absorbed at wall B when p₁ = p_d. This implies that at design, the flow after passing through the expansion fan is exactly parallel to wall B, so no reflected wave is needed.",
          "Step 4: Analyze off-design conditions. When p₁ ≠ p_d, the flow turning through the expansion fan is not the correct amount to be parallel to wall B. Thus, a reflected wave is generated at B to satisfy the solid wall boundary condition.",
          "Step 5: Determine the type of reflected wave. Since B is a solid wall, regardless of whether p₁ is greater than or less than p_d, the reflected wave must be an expansion wave to adjust the flow direction back to parallel. The specific family (left- or right-running) depends on the geometry, but the wave type remains expansion.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate each option: A (false, as argued), B (true, reflection is expansion), C (true, reflection is expansion), D (true, B always encounters an expansion wave, either the incident one or the reflected one). Therefore, the statement NOT true is A."
