        "reasoning": "At the design condition \\(p_1 = p_d = p_\\infty\\), the Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan generated at corner A is exactly cancelled (\"absorbed\") by the wall B, so that the flow downstream of B is parallel to the wall and at ambient pressure. This is analogous to the minimum-length nozzle design where the wall contour is chosen so that the expansion from the throat corner is fully cancelled by reflections, giving uniform exit flow.\n\nTo understand off-design behavior, recall the reflection rules from gas dynamics:\n1. **Reflection from a solid wall**: the flow must be tangent to the wall. An incident expansion reflects as an expansion (same wave family) to restore the required flow direction; an incident compression reflects as a compression. (Rathakrishnan, Gas Dynamics, Ch. 12, Fig. 12.14.)\n2. **Reflection from a free boundary (constant pressure)**: the boundary pressure must remain equal to the ambient. An incident expansion (which lowers pressure) reflects as a compression to bring pressure back up; an incident compression reflects as an expansion. (Rathakrishnan, Fig. 12.15; also Prof. V. Babu lecture on Prandtl-Meyer waves.)\n\nIn the given figure, B is a **solid wall** (a contour of the internal duct), not a free jet boundary. Therefore, any expansion fan that impinges on B will reflect as an **expansion fan**, not as a compression wave.\n\nNow examine the options:\n- **Option A**: \"For \\(p_1 < p_d\\), the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as a compression wave.\" This contradicts the solid-wall reflection rule. Regardless of whether \\(p_1\\) is above or below \\(p_d\\), an incident expansion on a solid wall reflects as an expansion. Hence A is **NOT true**.\n\n- **Option B**: \"For \\(p_1 > p_d\\), the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.\" This is consistent with the wall reflection rule, so B is true.\n\n- **Option C**: \"For \\(p_1 < p_d\\), the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.\" This is also consistent with the same rule, so C is true.\n\n- **Option D**: \"For \\(p_1 > p_d\\), B always sees an expansion.\" When \\(p_1 > p_d\\), the upstream pressure is higher than design, so the flow entering the corner A is at higher pressure than the design value. To reach the same ambient pressure \\(p_\\infty\\) downstream, the flow must undergo a **net expansion** somewhere in the duct. Since A is the only turning corner and the wall B is shaped to absorb the design expansion, the off-design condition still causes B to be impinged by expansion waves (possibly with different strengths and reflection patterns). Thus, B continues to \"see\" expansion waves, making D qualitatively correct in the context of this conceptual GATE question.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is not true is **Option A**, matching the official key."

        "notes": "RAG provided directly relevant explanations of wave reflection from solid walls and free boundaries (Rathakrishnan Ch. 12, figures 12.14 and 12.15) and a video segment on oblique shock reflection at constant-pressure boundaries. These were highly useful to justify why expansions reflect as expansions at solid walls and as compressions at free boundaries. Additional shock-tube content was less central but reinforced the general idea of wave reflections."
