        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the statement that is NOT true regarding the reflection of an expansion fan from 'wall B'. The critical interpretation is that 'wall B' refers to a solid boundary. In supersonic flow, when an expansion wave impinges upon a solid wall, it reflects as another expansion wave. This is because the solid wall boundary condition requires the flow to remain parallel to the wall. The incident expansion wave turns the flow away from the wall, so the reflected wave must turn the flow back towards the wall, and an expansion wave is the only type of wave that can achieve this while maintaining the same type of wave reflection from a solid boundary (expansion reflects as expansion, shock reflects as shock). \\n\\nLet's analyze each option based on this principle:\\n*   **A. For $p_1 < p_d$, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as a compression wave.** This statement is FALSE. A compression wave (shock) would increase pressure and turn the flow in a way that is inconsistent with reflection from a solid wall for an incident expansion. Therefore, this statement is NOT true.\\n*   **B. For $p_1 > p_d$, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.** This statement is TRUE. An expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave from a solid wall, regardless of the upstream pressure $p_1$ relative to the design pressure $p_d$.\\n*   **C. For $p_1 < p_d$, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.** This statement is TRUE. Similar to option B, an expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave from a solid wall.\\n*   **D. For $p_1 > p_d$, B always sees an expansion.** This statement is TRUE. The wave generated at A is explicitly described as an 'expansion generated at A', and it propagates towards B. Thus, B is always impinged upon by an expansion wave.\\n\\nSince the question asks for the statement that is NOT true, option A is the correct answer. The specific values of $p_1$ relative to $p_d$ only affect the strength of the waves and the final flow conditions, not the fundamental type of reflection from a solid wall."
