        "reasoning": "Moving the CG forward increases the static margin, making the aircraft more statically stable but also more nose-heavy. For a given lift coefficient, the nose-down pitching moment about the CG increases, so more nose-up elevator deflection is required to trim (Cm = 0). The trim relation from the RAG (Chunk 5) is\n\n$\\Delta E_{\\text{trim}} = \\Delta E_0 + \\dfrac{\\bar{N}_0 - \\bar{X}_{CG}}{C_{M_{\\Delta E}}} C_{L_{\\text{trim}}}$\n\nHere $(\\bar{N}_0 - \\bar{X}_{CG})$ is the static margin. When CG moves forward, $\\bar{X}_{CG}$ decreases, so $(\\bar{N}_0 - \\bar{X}_{CG})$ increases. Since $C_{M_{\\Delta E}} < 0$ for a conventional tail, the slope $\\dfrac{d\\Delta E}{dC_L} = \\dfrac{\\text{Static Margin}}{C_{M_{\\Delta E}}}$ becomes more negative in magnitude: higher $C_L$ requires larger-magnitude (more nose-up) elevator deflection.\n\nThe airplane can only be trimmed up to the $C_{L}$ where the required elevator deflection reaches its physical limit $\\Delta E_{\\max}$ (forward CG limit concept in Chunks 2, 3, 4). With a more forward CG, this limit is reached at a lower $C_L$. Therefore, the maximum lift coefficient $C_{L\\max}$ for which the airplane can still be trimmed decreases when the CG is moved forward. Hence option A (decrease) is correct."

          "1. Recall that trim in pitch requires the pitching moment coefficient about CG to be zero: $C_m = 0$. For a given flight condition, this is achieved by an appropriate elevator deflection $\\Delta E_{\\text{trim}}$.",
          "2. From longitudinal trim theory (Chunk 5), the elevator deflection required for trim varies with lift coefficient and CG location as: $\\Delta E_{\\text{trim}} = \\Delta E_0 + \\dfrac{\\bar{N}_0 - \\bar{X}_{CG}}{C_{M_{\\Delta E}}} C_{L_{\\text{trim}}}$.",
          "3. The term $(\\bar{N}_0 - \\bar{X}_{CG})$ is the static margin. Moving the CG forward (towards the nose) means $\\bar{X}_{CG}$ decreases, so the static margin increases.",
          "4. For a conventional tail, $C_{M_{\\Delta E}} < 0$. Thus $\\dfrac{d\\Delta E}{dC_L} = \\dfrac{\\text{Static Margin}}{C_{M_{\\Delta E}}}$ becomes more negative when static margin increases: higher $C_L$ now needs larger-magnitude nose-up elevator deflection.",
          "5. The elevator has a finite deflection limit $\\Delta E_{\\max}$ (Chunks 2, 3, 4). The maximum $C_L$ at which the aircraft can still be trimmed is set by the condition that the required $|\\Delta E_{\\text{trim}}|$ just equals $|\\Delta E_{\\max}|$.",
          "6. With a more forward CG (larger static margin), this deflection limit is reached at a lower $C_L$. Therefore, the maximum lift coefficient for which trim is possible decreases when the CG is moved forward.",

          "name": "Graphical trim curve method",
          "description": "Plot the elevator trim curve (elevator deflection vs CL) for two CG positions: original and more forward. Superimpose the elevator deflection limits (e.g., maximum nose-up). The intersection of each curve with the limit line gives the maximum CL that can be trimmed. Comparing the two curves shows that the forward CG case intersects at a lower CL.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides strong visual intuition about how CG shifts affect trim and control limits. Cons: Requires more time and drawing; not practical in a timed exam but excellent for learning.",

          "description": "Write the pitching moment balance about the CG including wing, tail, and weight contributions. Move the CG forward and re-evaluate how much tail lift (and thus elevator deflection) is needed to balance moments at a high CL. Show that the required tail moment grows faster with CL when CG is forward, reaching tail/elevator limits at a lower CL.",
