        "reasoning": "The correct answer is A (decrease). Moving the center of gravity (CG) forward increases the static margin, making the aircraft more longitudinally stable. This results in a more negative slope of the pitching moment coefficient versus lift coefficient curve ($\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}$). To trim ($C_m = 0$) at a given lift coefficient, a specific elevator deflection is required. The required nose-up elevator deflection (typically trailing edge down) increases with lift coefficient and with a more forward CG. Since elevator deflection has a physical limit ($\\delta_{e_{max}}$), the maximum lift coefficient at which trim can be achieved (i.e., before the required elevator deflection exceeds the available limit) decreases as the CG moves forward. This is a standard concept in aircraft stability and control, directly supported by the RAG context."

          "Step 3: Recognize the effect of moving CG forward. Moving CG forward increases the static margin ($h_n - h$), making $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}$ more negative (more stable).",
          "Step 4: Solve for trim elevator deflection. Setting $C_m = 0$ gives $\\delta_{e_{trim}} = -\\frac{C_{m_0} + \\left(\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}\\right) C_{L_{trim}}}{C_{m_{\\delta_e}}}$.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the relationship. For a given $C_{L_{trim}}$, a more negative $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}$ (due to forward CG) increases the magnitude of $\\delta_{e_{trim}}$ required (assuming $C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$ is negative).",
          "Step 6: Consider the limiting factor. The elevator has a maximum deflection limit $\\delta_{e_{max}}$. The maximum trim-able lift coefficient $C_{L_{max,trim}}$ occurs when $|\\delta_{e_{trim}}| = \\delta_{e_{max}}$.",
          "Step 7: Deduce the effect. As CG moves forward, the required $\\delta_{e_{trim}}$ for any given $C_L$ increases. Therefore, the $C_L$ at which $\\delta_{e_{trim}}$ reaches $\\delta_{e_{max}}$ becomes lower. Hence, $C_{L_{max,trim}}$ decreases."
