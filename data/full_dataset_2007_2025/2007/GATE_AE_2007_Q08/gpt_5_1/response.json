        "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability depends on the net pitching moment slope with respect to angle of attack, which is governed by the relative positions of the aerodynamic centers (AC) and the center of gravity (CG), and the lift-curve slopes and areas of wing and tail. A larger wing does not automatically mean more or less stability; its effect depends on where its AC lies relative to the CG and on the tail contribution. If the larger wing’s aerodynamic center is behind the CG, then an increase in wing lift with angle of attack produces a nose-down restoring moment (stabilizing). Increasing wing area in that configuration increases the stabilizing contribution of the wing, so the airplane will have more longitudinal static stability, especially for an aft tail configuration where the tail is already stabilizing. Options A, B, and C claim a necessary (always true) effect independent of AC–CG geometry, which is incorrect. Only option D correctly states a conditional situation under which the larger wing necessarily increases stability."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall that longitudinal static stability requires a negative pitching moment coefficient slope with respect to angle of attack, i.e., C_m_\\alpha < 0.",
          "Step 2: For each lifting surface, the sign of its contribution to C_m_\\alpha depends on whether its aerodynamic center is ahead of or behind the CG. If AC is behind CG, increasing lift with angle of attack gives a nose-down (stabilizing) moment; if AC is ahead of CG, it gives a nose-up (destabilizing) moment.",
          "Step 3: The wing contribution to stability can be written conceptually as C_m_\\alpha,wing \\propto -a_w S_w (x_ac_w - x_CG), where a_w is wing lift-curve slope, S_w is wing area, and x_ac_w - x_CG is the moment arm.",
          "Step 4: Increasing wing area S_w by itself does not fix the sign of this term; it only scales its magnitude. The sign (stabilizing or destabilizing) is set by (x_ac_w - x_CG).",
          "Step 5: If the larger wing’s aerodynamic center is behind the CG (x_ac_w > x_CG), then (x_ac_w - x_CG) is positive, so the term is negative and stabilizing. Increasing S_w then makes C_m_\\alpha,wing more negative, i.e., more stable.",
          "Step 6: In an aft-tail airplane, the tail is also behind the CG and is stabilizing. So with both wing AC and tail AC behind the CG, increasing wing size further increases overall longitudinal static stability. This is exactly the situation described in option D.",
          "Step 7: Therefore, there is no unconditional rule that a larger wing always increases or decreases stability; only the conditional statement in D is necessarily true."
