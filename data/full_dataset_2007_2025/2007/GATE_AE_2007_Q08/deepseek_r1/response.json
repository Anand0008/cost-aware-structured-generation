        "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability requires a negative pitching moment coefficient derivative ($C_{m_\\alpha}$). The wing's contribution to $C_{m_\\alpha}$ depends on the relative positions of its aerodynamic center (AC) and the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). If the wing's AC is behind the CG ($x_{AC_{wing}} > x_{CG}$), the wing contribution is stabilizing ($C_{m_\\alpha_{wing}} < 0$). In a conventional aft-tail configuration, the horizontal tail is also stabilizing. For a larger wing (increased area $S_w$ and/or chord $\\bar{c}$), if its AC is behind the CG, its stabilizing contribution increases in magnitude (since lift and moment scale with size), potentially enhancing overall stability. However, this is not universally true; it depends on the AC-CG relationship. Option D correctly states the condition under which a larger wing necessarily provides more stability: for an aft-tail airplane, if the larger wing's AC is behind the CG. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the effect of wing size on stability is not absolute; it depends on design parameters like AC and CG locations."

          "Step 2: Understand the wing's contribution: $C_{m_\\alpha_{wing}} = -a_w \\left( \\frac{x_{AC_{wing}} - x_{CG}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$, where $a_w$ is the wing lift curve slope. This term is negative (stabilizing) if $x_{AC_{wing}} > x_{CG}$ (AC behind CG), and positive (destabilizing) if $x_{AC_{wing}} < x_{CG}$ (AC ahead of CG).",
          "Step 3: Consider the effect of increasing wing size. A 'larger wing' typically means increased wing area ($S_w$) and mean aerodynamic chord ($\\bar{c}$). This increases the wing's lift generation for a given $\\alpha$, and if $x_{AC_{wing}} > x_{CG}$, the magnitude of the stabilizing pitching moment from the wing increases.",
          "Step 4: For an aft-tail airplane, the horizontal tail provides a stabilizing contribution ($C_{m_\\alpha_{tail}} < 0$). The tail volume ratio $V_h = \\frac{S_t l_t}{S_w \\bar{c}}$ decreases if $S_w$ and $\\bar{c}$ increase while tail parameters are fixed, reducing the tail's relative effectiveness. However, if the wing itself is stabilizing (AC behind CG), the increased wing contribution can outweigh any reduction in tail contribution, leading to a net increase in stability.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the options: (A) 'more longitudinal static stability' is not necessarily true because if the wing's AC is ahead of CG, a larger wing could be more destabilizing. (B) 'less longitudinal static stability' is also not necessarily true for the same reason. (C) 'same longitudinal static stability' is false because wing size affects contributions. (D) provides the specific condition (aft-tail airplane, wing AC behind CG) under which a larger wing necessarily enhances stability, making it the correct choice."
