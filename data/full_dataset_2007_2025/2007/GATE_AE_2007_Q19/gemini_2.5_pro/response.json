        "reasoning": "The Joukowski transformation is a specific type of conformal mapping used in aerodynamics. Its primary utility is to transform a simple circle in a complex plane (z-plane) into an airfoil shape in another complex plane ($\\zeta$-plane). This mathematical transformation is crucial because analyzing incompressible, inviscid fluid flow over a simple circular cylinder is an analytically solvable problem in potential flow theory. By mapping the airfoil to a circle, the complex flow problem around the airfoil can be solved by first solving the much simpler flow problem around the circle and then mapping the solution back. Therefore, the ease of mathematically transforming an airfoil into a circle (and vice-versa) is the fundamental reason for studying Joukowski airfoils. Option B accurately reflects this. Option A is incorrect because Joukowski airfoils, characterized by a cusped (zero-angle) trailing edge, are generally not used in modern aircraft due to practical manufacturing difficulties and suboptimal aerodynamic performance compared to more advanced designs (as supported by RAG Chunk 3). Option C is misleading; while the *generating* circle is simple, the resulting airfoil geometry can be complex, and the primary reason for study is the mathematical tractability of the transformation, not just the geometry itself. Option D is incorrect; Joukowski airfoils do not inherently possess the highest lift curve slope among all airfoils."
