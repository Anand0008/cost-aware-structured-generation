This property allows the complex potential flow problem around an airfoil to be solved by first solving the simpler problem of flow around a circular cylinder and then applying the transformation. The significance lies in this mathematical tractability, enabling analytical solutions for lift, circulation, and pressure distribution. While Joukowski airfoils have specific geometric characteristics (like a cusped trailing edge) and are not widely used in modern aircraft, they are studied primarily for this elegant mathematical transformation property. Options A, C, and D are incorrect: they are not commonly used, their geometry is not the simplest, and they do not have the highest lift curve slope."
