        "reasoning": "The question asks for the engine with minimum specific fuel consumption (SFC) for a subsonic passenger transport airplane. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **A. Turbojet engine with afterburner:** Afterburners are used for short bursts of increased thrust, primarily for supersonic acceleration or takeoff. They significantly *increase* specific fuel consumption, making them highly inefficient for sustained subsonic cruise. (RAG Chunk 2 states afterburner SFC is 30-36 mg/(N*s), much higher than basic turbojet's 16-24 mg/(N*s)).\n2.  **B. Turbofan engine:** Turbofan engines are the workhorse of modern subsonic commercial aviation. They are designed for high subsonic to transonic speeds (Mach 0.8-0.95) and offer the best specific fuel consumption among jet engines for this flight regime. This is achieved by bypassing a large amount of air around the core engine, which increases propulsive efficiency and reduces exhaust velocity, leading to lower fuel consumption per unit of thrust. (RAG Chunk 3 states turbofan operating range is Mach 0.8-0.95; RAG Chunks 5 & 6 highlight turbofans as a blend optimizing for overall efficiency in subsonic flight).\n3.  **C. Ramjet engine:** Ramjet engines operate efficiently only at high supersonic speeds (Mach 3-5) and cannot produce thrust at zero or low speeds as they lack a compressor. They have a very high specific fuel consumption compared to turbojets at relevant speeds. Therefore, they are unsuitable for subsonic passenger transport. (RAG Chunk 2 states ramjet SFC is 60-90 mg/(N*s); RAG Chunk 3 specifies ramjet operating range as Mach 3-5).\n4.  **D. Scramjet engine:** Scramjet engines are an advanced form of ramjet designed for hypersonic speeds (Mach 5+). They are even less suitable for subsonic flight than ramjets and are still largely experimental. (RAG Chunk 3 specifies scramjet operating range as Mach 5+; RAG Chunks 5 & 6 define scramjets for hypersonic flight).\n\nConsidering the requirements of 'subsonic passenger transport' and 'minimum specific fuel consumption', the turbofan engine is the most appropriate choice."

          "Step 1: Understand the mission requirements. The question specifies a 'subsonic passenger transport airplane' and the objective of 'minimum specific fuel consumption'.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the operating speed range of each engine type. Subsonic flight typically refers to speeds below Mach 1, with commercial airliners usually operating in the high subsonic (Mach 0.8-0.9) range.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Ramjet and Scramjet engines. According to RAG Chunk 3, Ramjets operate efficiently at Mach 3-5 and Scramjets at Mach 5+. They cannot operate at subsonic speeds and are therefore unsuitable for the given mission. This eliminates options C and D.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Turbojet engine with afterburner. Afterburners are used for thrust augmentation, primarily for supersonic flight or short bursts. RAG Chunk 2 indicates that afterburning turbojets have a significantly higher specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to basic turbojets. Using an afterburner for sustained subsonic cruise would result in very poor fuel efficiency, contradicting the 'minimum specific fuel consumption' requirement. This eliminates option A.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Turbofan engine. RAG Chunk 3 states that Turbofan engines operate efficiently in the high subsonic to transonic range (Mach 0.8-0.95), which aligns perfectly with subsonic passenger transport. RAG Chunks 5 and 6 describe turbofans as optimizing for overall efficiency in subsonic flight. Turbofans achieve lower SFC than pure turbojets at these speeds due to their higher propulsive efficiency from the bypass air.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the most suitable engine. Based on both the operating speed compatibility and the goal of minimum specific fuel consumption for subsonic passenger transport, the Turbofan engine is the optimal choice."
