        "reasoning": "For a subsonic passenger transport airplane, the primary goal is fuel efficiency (minimum specific fuel consumption - SFC). Turbofan engines are specifically designed for high propulsive efficiency in the subsonic flight regime (Mach 0.8-0.95). They achieve this by using a large bypass ratio, where a significant portion of air is accelerated by a fan without going through the core, providing thrust more efficiently than a pure jet. In contrast: (A) Turbojet with afterburner has very high SFC (comparable to ramjet, around 30-90 mg/(N*s)) as the afterburner is fuel-inefficient and used only for short-duration thrust boost. (C) Ramjet engines have high SFC (60-90 mg/(N*s)) and are inefficient at subsonic speeds; they require supersonic flight (Mach 3-5) for efficient operation and cannot produce static thrust. (D) Scramjet engines are for hypersonic speeds (Mach 5+) and have even more severe limitations at low speeds. Therefore, the turbofan is the clear choice for minimum SFC in this application."

          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: Turbojet with afterburner. Afterburners dramatically increase thrust by injecting additional fuel downstream of the turbine, but this leads to very high SFC (similar to ramjets). They are used for supersonic dash, not efficient cruise.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: Turbofan engine. Turbofans are the workhorse of modern subsonic aviation. They have high bypass ratios, leading to high propulsive efficiency at subsonic speeds and consequently the lowest SFC among jet engines in this regime.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: Ramjet engine. Ramjets have no compressor; they rely on ram pressure for compression, which is only effective at high supersonic speeds (Mach > 2). At subsonic speeds, their SFC is poor, and they cannot produce static thrust.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: Scramjet engine. Scramjets are a variant of ramjets where combustion occurs at supersonic flow. They are designed for hypersonic speeds (Mach > 5) and are completely unsuitable for subsonic flight.",
