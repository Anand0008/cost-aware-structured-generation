        "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. Turbofan engine. Turbofan engines are the most suitable for subsonic passenger transport aircraft to achieve minimum specific fuel consumption (SFC).\n\nTurbofan engines are a hybrid design that combines the high-speed jet thrust of a turbojet with the high-efficiency, low-speed thrust of a turboprop. The large fan in a turbofan engine bypasses a significant portion of air around the core engine, generating a majority of the thrust from the fan. This bypass airflow provides high propulsive efficiency at subsonic speeds, resulting in lower SFC compared to a basic turbojet.\n\nIn contrast, the other options are not well-suited for subsonic passenger transport:\n- Turbojet with afterburner (option A) has higher SFC due to the additional fuel burn in the afterburner.\n- Ramjet engine (option C) operates efficiently only at high supersonic speeds, not subsonic.\n- Scramjet engine (option D) is designed for hypersonic flight, beyond the speed range of subsonic passenger aircraft."
