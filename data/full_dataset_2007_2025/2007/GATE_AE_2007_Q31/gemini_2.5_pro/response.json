Another key property of eigenvalues states that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a non-singular matrix A, then $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of its inverse, $A^{-1}$. Applying this property:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = 2$, the corresponding eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ is $1/2$.\n- For $\\lambda_2 = 3$, the corresponding eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ is $1/3$.\nThus, the eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are $1/2$ and $1/3$, which corresponds to option D."
