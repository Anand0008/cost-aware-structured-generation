Substitute $r=1$ into the magnification factor formula: $M_r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - 1^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\times 1)^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0 + 4 \\zeta^2)}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta}$. Thus, $1 = X_{st} \\times \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta}$, which implies $X_{st} = 2 \\zeta$ (Equation 1).",

Substitute $r=0.5$ into the magnification factor formula: $M_{0.5r} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - (0.5)^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\times 0.5)^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - 0.25)^2 + \\zeta^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((0.75)^2 + \\zeta^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)}}$. Thus, $0.5 = X_{st} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)}}$ (Equation 2).",
