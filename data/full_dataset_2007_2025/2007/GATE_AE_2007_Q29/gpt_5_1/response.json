        "reasoning": "For a harmonically forced SDOF system, the steady-state displacement amplitude is given by \\(X = \\frac{F_0/k}{\\sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}}\\), where \\(r = \\omega/\\omega_n\\). At resonance (for light damping) the amplitude is approximately \\(X_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{F_0/k}{2\\zeta}\\). We are told: amplitude at resonance = 1 cm, and amplitude at half the resonant frequency (i.e., at \\(r = 0.5\\)) is 0.5 cm. Taking the ratio of amplitudes eliminates \\(F_0/k\\). Let \\(H(r)\\) be the magnification factor. Then \\(H(1) = 1/(2\\zeta)\\) and \\(H(0.5) = 1/\\sqrt{(1-0.25)^2 + (2\\zeta\\cdot 0.5)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{0.75^2 + \\zeta^2}\\). The amplitude ratio is \\(X_{0.5}/X_{\\text{res}} = 0.5/1 = 0.5 = H(0.5)/H(1)\\). Thus \\n\\n\\[0.5 = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{0.75^2 + \\zeta^2}}{1/(2\\zeta)} = \\frac{2\\zeta}{\\sqrt{0.75^2 + \\zeta^2}}.\\]\\n\\nSquaring both sides: \\(0.25 = \\frac{4\\zeta^2}{0.5625 + \\zeta^2}\\). Hence \\(0.25(0.5625 + \\zeta^2) = 4\\zeta^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 0.140625 + 0.25\\zeta^2 = 4\\zeta^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 0.140625 = 3.75\\zeta^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow \\zeta^2 = 0.140625/3.75 = 0.0375\\). Therefore \\(\\zeta = \\sqrt{0.0375} \\approx 0.1936\\). This matches option D, confirming the official key."
