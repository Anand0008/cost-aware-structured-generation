It also states that for a non-dimensionalized center of gravity $\\bar{X}_{CG} = 0.3$, $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = -0.1$. From this, we can determine the static margin (SM) at this CG location:\n$SM = -\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = -(-0.1) = 0.1$\n\nThe static margin is also defined as the non-dimensional distance between the neutral point ($\\bar{X}_{NP}$) and the center of gravity ($\\bar{X}_{CG}$):\n$SM = \\bar{X}_{NP} - \\bar{X}_{CG}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$0.1 = \\bar{X}_{NP} - 0.3$\n$\\bar{X}_{NP} = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4$\nSo, the neutral point is located at $0.4\\bar{c}$. The neutral point location is an aerodynamic characteristic of the aircraft and is assumed to be constant for a given configuration.\n\nThe designer's requirement is to keep the longitudinal static stability margin (SM) within 5% to 15% of the mean aerodynamic chord, i.e., $0.05 \\le SM \\le 0.15$.\n\nWe need to find the *most forward* location of the airplane's center of gravity. A more forward CG increases the static margin (makes the aircraft more stable). Therefore, to find the most forward CG, we must use the *maximum* allowed static margin, which is $SM_{max} = 0.15$.\n\nUsing the static margin formula again with $SM_{max}$ and the calculated $\\bar{X}_{NP}$:\n$SM_{max} = \\bar{X}_{NP} - \\bar{X}_{CG,forward}$\n$0.15 = 0.4 - \\bar{X}_{CG,forward}$\n$\\bar{X}_{CG,forward} = 0.4 - 0.15 = 0.25$\n\nThus, the most forward location of the airplane center of gravity permitted is $0.25\\bar{c}$.
