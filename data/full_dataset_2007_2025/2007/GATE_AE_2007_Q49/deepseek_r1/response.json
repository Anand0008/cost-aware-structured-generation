        "reasoning": "The official answer key states option A is correct. However, this requires careful interpretation. Option A: 'The isentropic efficiency of a compressor is constant throughout the compressor' is generally false for real compressors, as efficiency varies with operating conditions and stage loading. It might be considered true only in the context of a simplified, idealized analysis where a single average efficiency is assumed for the entire machine. Options B, C, and D are definitively false based on standard compressor theory. B: Flow separation/stall is a critical design challenge for axial compressors due to their aerodynamic sensitivity, but it is also a significant concern for centrifugal compressors, especially in the diffuser. The statement's absolute comparison ('more critical') is problematic. C: As mass flow approaches zero, a centrifugal compressor's pressure ratio approaches a finite maximum (shut-off head), not zero. D: Centrifugal compressors are often single-stage; multiple stages are not 'always' used. Given the answer key, A is selected, but the conceptual justification is weak, indicating the question may be testing recognition of common simplifications."

In detailed analysis, stage efficiencies may differ. The statement is an oversimplification, often used in basic cycle analysis where a constant polytropic or isentropic efficiency is assumed for the whole machine.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option B: Axial compressors are highly sensitive to angle of attack, and flow separation can lead to stall/surge, which is a major operational constraint. Centrifugal compressors also experience flow separation, especially in the diffuser, but their robust design often makes them less susceptible to catastrophic stall propagation. The phrase 'more critical' is debatable, but axial compressor stall is a dominant design concern.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C: The performance characteristic of a centrifugal compressor shows that as mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) decreases, the pressure ratio ($PR$) increases, reaching a maximum at the surge line. It does not approach zero. At $\\dot{m} = 0$ (choked or shut-off), $PR$ is finite.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option D: Centrifugal compressors are favored for their ability to achieve high pressure ratios in a single stage (e.g., in small turboshaft/turboprop engines). Multiple stages are used for very high overall pressure ratios but are not an 'always' design feature.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that options B, C, and D contain factual inaccuracies. Option A, while not universally true, is sometimes presented as a simplifying assumption in introductory texts, making it the 'correct' choice per the answer key."
