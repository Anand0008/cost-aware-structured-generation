Compressor efficiency is typically assumed to be constant throughout the compression process for simplicity in analysis, even though in reality it may vary slightly. This is a valid assumption for conceptual-level understanding. The other options are incorrect:\n- Option B is false, as flow separation is more critical for axial compressors than centrifugal compressors.\n- Option C is false, the pressure ratio of a centrifugal compressor does not approach zero as the mass flow rate approaches zero.\n- Option D is false, centrifugal compressors can be designed with a single stage, not necessarily multiple stages."
