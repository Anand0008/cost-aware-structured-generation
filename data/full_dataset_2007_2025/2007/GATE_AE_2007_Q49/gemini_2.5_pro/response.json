        "reasoning": "The provided answer key states A is the correct option. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A. The isentropic efficiency of a compressor is constant throughout the compressor.**\n    *   **Analysis:** In a strict sense, the isentropic efficiency of a compressor is not constant; it varies with operating conditions (e.g., mass flow rate, rotational speed) and can differ slightly between stages in a multi-stage compressor. However, for simplified thermodynamic cycle analysis of a gas turbine, the compressor is often modeled with a single, constant isentropic efficiency value for the entire component. If interpreted in this simplified, overall system context (rather than at every infinitesimal point or stage), this statement could be considered true as an engineering approximation.\n\n*   **B. Flow separation problems are more critical for the axial compressors than for the centrifugal compressors.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This statement is generally considered **TRUE** in turbomachinery. Axial compressors are highly susceptible to flow separation and stall due to the adverse pressure gradients over multiple airfoil stages, especially at off-design conditions (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4 explicitly state axial compressors are 'prone to stall' and have 'flow separation limits'). Centrifugal compressors are 'less prone to stall compared to axial for a single stage' (RAG Chunks 1, 2). Given the strong evidence for B being true based on common turbomachinery principles and the provided RAG context, there might be an error in the question or the provided answer key, or a very specific interpretation is expected where B is considered false. However, adhering to the given answer key, B must be considered incorrect in this specific context.\n\n*   **C. The pressure ratio of a centrifugal compressor approaches zero as the compressor mass flow rate approaches zero.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This statement is **FALSE**. As the mass flow rate approaches zero (e.g., near the surge line on a compressor map), the compressor's pressure ratio typically reaches its *maximum* value before surge occurs. At zero mass flow, the compressor is still attempting to build pressure against a closed system, leading to high-pressure ratios, not zero.\n\n*   **D. Centrifugal compressors are always designed with multiple stages.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This statement is **FALSE**. Centrifugal compressors are known for achieving a very high pressure ratio in a *single stage* (typically ~4-8) (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3). While multi-stage centrifugal compressors exist for very high overall pressure ratios, many applications (e.g., small gas turbines, turbochargers) utilize single-stage centrifugal compressors. The absolute qualifier 'always' makes this statement incorrect.\n\nTherefore, if A is the correct answer, it relies on a simplifying assumption often made in preliminary cycle analysis, while B, C, and D are considered incorrect in the context of this question, despite the strong general truthfulness of B."
