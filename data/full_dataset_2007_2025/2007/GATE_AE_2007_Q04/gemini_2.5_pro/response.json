        "reasoning": "A satellite remains in a stable circular orbit because there is a precise balance between the Earth's gravitational attraction pulling it inwards and the centripetal force required for its circular motion. In a non-inertial (rotating) frame of reference moving with the satellite, this centripetal force is often conceptualized as an outward 'centrifugal pseudo-force' that balances the inward gravitational pull. This dynamic equilibrium ensures the satellite continuously 'falls around' the Earth, following its curvature, rather than falling directly onto it or flying off into space. Options B and D are incorrect as satellites in stable orbits do not require continuous thrust and do not rely on aerodynamic lift in the vacuum of space. Option C describes the effect of this balance but option A provides the fundamental force balance explanation, which is the more direct physical reason."

          "**Step 3: Relate gravity and velocity to circular motion.** In a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force acts as the centripetal force, continuously pulling the satellite towards the center of its path. This centripetal force is essential to keep the satellite from flying off into space due to its tangential velocity.",
          "**Step 4: Consider the force balance in a rotating frame of reference.** From the perspective of the satellite itself (a non-inertial frame rotating with it), its motion generates an apparent outward force called the centrifugal force. For a stable orbit, this outward centrifugal force precisely balances the inward gravitational attraction.",
          "**Step 5: Conclude the mechanism of orbital stability.** This balance between the gravitational pull and the centrifugal (or centripetal) force ensures that the satellite continuously 'falls around' the Earth, matching the curvature of the planet, rather than impacting the surface or escaping its gravitational field."
