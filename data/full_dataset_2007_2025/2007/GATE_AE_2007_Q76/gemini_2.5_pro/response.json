From the provided graph, identify the minimum power required ($P_{R,min}$) for both sea level (solid curve) and 5 km altitude (dashed curve). Both minimums are at $5 \\times 10^4$ W.",
          "**Step 2: Calculate Power Available at Sea Level ($P_{A,0}$).** The rate of climb is given by $ROC = P_{excess} / W$, where $P_{excess} = P_A - P_R$. For maximum ROC, we consider the minimum power required. Therefore, the excess power at sea level is $P_{excess,0} = ROC_0 \\times W$. The power available at sea level is then $P_{A,0} = P_{excess,0} + P_{R,min,0}$. Substitute the values: $P_{A,0} = (4 \\text{ m/s} \\times 20000 \\text{ N}) + 50000 \\text{ W} = 80000 \\text{ W} + 50000 \\text{ W} = 130000 \\text{ W}$.",

Substitute the values: $P_{A,5km} = 130000 \\text{ W} \\times (0.74 \\text{ kg/m}^3 / 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3) \\approx 130000 \\text{ W} \\times 0.60408 \\approx 78530.4 \\text{ W}$.",

Substitute the values: $P_{excess,max,5km} = 78530.4 \\text{ W} - 50000 \\text{ W} = 28530.4 \\text{ W}$.",

          "description": "Instead of reading $P_R$ from a graph, one could analytically derive the power required curve using aerodynamic principles ($P_R = D \\times V$, where $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$ and $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$). This would allow for a more precise calculation of $P_{R,min}$ at different altitudes if aircraft geometric and aerodynamic parameters were provided.",
