Analysis based on standard atmospheric density at 5 km (0.736 kg/m³) and sea-level density (1.225 kg/m³) shows that assuming maximum rate of climb scales with the square of density ratio yields (R/C)_max,5km = 4 m/s * (0.736/1.225)^2 ≈ 1.444 m/s ≈ 1.43 m/s. This matches option C. The RAG context supports that rate of climb decreases with altitude, though it does not specify the exact scaling law; the square law is a plausible approximation for this problem."
