        "reasoning": "For a prismatic beam with rectangular cross-section of height h (along z) and width b (along y), subjected to a transverse shear force V_z, the classical shear formula gives the shear stress distribution as \\(\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\dfrac{V_z Q(z)}{I_y b}\\), where Q is the first moment of area of the portion of the cross-section above (or below) the level z about the neutral axis, and I_y is the second moment of area about the y-axis. For a rectangle, this leads to a parabolic distribution: \\(\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\dfrac{3}{2} \\tau_{\\text{avg}} \\left(1 - \\dfrac{4 z^2}{h^2}\\right)\\), where \\(\\tau_{\\text{avg}} = V_z/(b h)\\) and z is measured from the neutral axis (z = 0) to the top/bottom surfaces at z = \\pm h/2. Rewriting this in terms of I_y and h, using \\(I_y = b h^3/12\\), we obtain \\(\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\dfrac{V_z (h/2)^2}{2 I_y} \\left(1 - \\dfrac{z^2}{(h/2)^2}\\right)\\). This matches option B exactly. The other options either give linear, quadratic-only, or constant distributions, which contradict the known parabolic profile and boundary conditions (zero shear at z = \\pm h/2, maximum at z = 0)."

          "Step 1: Recognize that the beam has a rectangular cross-section and is subjected to a transverse shear force V_z = dM_y/dx, so the shear stress distribution across the depth must be obtained from the standard shear formula for beams.",
          "Step 2: Recall the general shear formula for beams: \\(\\tau = V Q / (I b)\\), where V is the internal shear force, Q is the first moment of area of the portion of the cross-section above (or below) the level where \\(\\tau\\) is evaluated, I is the second moment of area about the neutral axis, and b is the width at that level.",

Compute Q(z) for the area above level z; this gives a quadratic function in z, leading to a parabolic shear stress distribution.",
          "Step 4: Using standard derivations (from strength of materials), the resulting expression is \\(\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\dfrac{V_z}{2 I_y} \\left(\\dfrac{h^2}{4} - z^2\\right)\\). Factor out \\((h/2)^2\\) to write it as \\(\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\dfrac{V_z (h/2)^2}{2 I_y} \\left(1 - \\dfrac{z^2}{(h/2)^2}\\right)\\).",
