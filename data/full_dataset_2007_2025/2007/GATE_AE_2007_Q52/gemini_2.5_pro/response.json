Chunks 4 and 6 provided an almost identical example for octane, which was extremely helpful for confirming the calculation method and molecular weights. Chunk 2 provided the general stoichiometric framework, and Chunk 1 defined the equivalence ratio. Chunk 5 clarified air composition. The RAG context directly supported the solution."
