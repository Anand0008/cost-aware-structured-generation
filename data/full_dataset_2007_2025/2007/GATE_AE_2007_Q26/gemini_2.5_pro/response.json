          "Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal. We have two pipes with different diameters ($D_1 \\neq D_2$) carrying the same fluid (water) at the same volume flow rate ($Q_1 = Q_2$). We need to compare their Reynolds numbers.",
          "Step 2: Write down the formula for the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is given by $\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu}$, where $\\rho$ is fluid density, $V$ is average flow velocity, $D$ is pipe diameter, and $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity.",
          "Step 3: Relate the flow velocity ($V$) to the given volume flow rate ($Q$) and pipe diameter ($D$). The volume flow rate is $Q = A V$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. For a circular pipe, $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$. Therefore, $V = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the expression for $V$ into the Reynolds number formula. This yields $\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}\\right) D}{\\mu}$.",
          "Step 5: Simplify the expression for the Reynolds number. $\\text{Re} = \\frac{4 \\rho Q}{\\pi \\mu D}$.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the relationship. Since the fluid is water and the volume flow rate is the same for both pipes, $\\rho$, $Q$, and $\\mu$ are constant. The terms $4$ and $\\pi$ are also constants. Thus, the Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the pipe diameter ($D$), i.e., $\\text{Re} \\propto \\frac{1}{D}$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude based on the inverse proportionality. A narrower pipe has a smaller diameter ($D$). Since $\\text{Re}$ is inversely proportional to $D$, a smaller $D$ will result in a larger $\\text{Re}$. Therefore, the Reynolds number is larger in the narrower pipe."
