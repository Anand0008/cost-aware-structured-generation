An isentropic process is a reversible adiabatic process, meaning there is no heat transfer and no losses due to friction or other irreversibilities. This ideal process ensures that the maximum possible pressure is achieved by converting all kinetic energy into internal energy and flow work. The retrieved knowledge consistently supports this definition, highlighting that while stagnation temperature and enthalpy are defined for an adiabatic process, stagnation pressure specifically requires the more restrictive isentropic condition (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)."
