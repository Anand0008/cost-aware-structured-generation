          "Step 2: Assume a harmonic solution for the displacement $u(x,t) = \\phi(x) T(t)$, where $T(t)$ is a harmonic function of time. Substituting this into the governing equation and performing separation of variables leads to the spatial ordinary differential equation: $\\phi''(x) + \\beta^2 \\phi(x) = 0$, where $\\beta = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ is the wave number and $\\omega$ is the natural frequency.",
          "Step 3: Write down the general solution for the spatial mode shape $\\phi(x)$: $\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\beta x) + C_2 \\cos(\\beta x)$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.",
          "Step 4: Apply the first boundary condition for a rod fixed at $x=0$. A fixed end implies zero displacement, so $\\phi(0) = 0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the general solution: $C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.",
          "Step 5: The simplified mode shape becomes $\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\beta x)$.",
          "Step 6: Apply the second boundary condition for a rod free at $x=L$. A free end implies zero axial force, which means zero axial strain. Therefore, the derivative of displacement with respect to $x$ must be zero at $x=L$: $\\phi'(L) = 0$. First, find the derivative of the simplified mode shape: $\\phi'(x) = C_1 \\beta \\cos(\\beta x)$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute $x=L$ into the derivative and set it to zero: $C_1 \\beta \\cos(\\beta L) = 0$.",
          "Step 8: For a non-trivial solution (i.e., $C_1 \\neq 0$ and $\\beta \\neq 0$), the term $\\cos(\\beta L)$ must be zero. Thus, the characteristic equation is $\\cos(\\beta L) = 0$.",
          "Step 9: Substitute $\\beta = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ back into the characteristic equation to obtain the final form in terms of natural frequency $\\omega$: $\\cos(\\frac{\\omega L}{c}) = 0$."
