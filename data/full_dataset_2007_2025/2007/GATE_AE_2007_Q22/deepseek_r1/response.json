Statement (ii) is true: for square matrices, PQ = I (since I² = I) implies P and Q are inverses of each other; specifically, Q⁻¹ exists and equals P. Statements (iii) and (iv) are false because matrix multiplication is not commutative in general; correct expansions are (P+Q)² = P² + PQ + QP + Q² and (P−Q)² = P² − PQ − QP + Q², which simplify to the given forms only if PQ = QP.

By definition, Q⁻¹ satisfies Q Q⁻¹ = I and Q⁻¹ Q = I. From PQ = I, we have P is a left inverse of Q. For square matrices, a left inverse is also a right inverse, so QP = I and thus P = Q⁻¹. Hence, (ii) is true.",
