Then P ≠ 0, Q ≠ 0, but PQ = 0. So (i) is false.\n(ii) \"PQ = I² implies P = Q⁻¹\". Since I² = I, the condition is PQ = I. For square matrices, if PQ = I, then P is a right inverse of Q and Q is a left inverse of P. For square matrices left and right inverses coincide and are unique, so Q is invertible and P = Q⁻¹. Thus (ii) is true.\n(iii) \"(P + Q)² = P² + 2PQ + Q²\" would require the scalar binomial expansion, but for matrices multiplication is not commutative. Compute: (P + Q)² = (P + Q)(P + Q) = P² + PQ + QP + Q². This equals P² + 2PQ + Q² only if PQ = QP. In general P and Q need not commute, so (iii) is false.\n(iv) Similarly, (P − Q)² = (P − Q)(P − Q) = P² − PQ − QP + Q², which equals P² − 2PQ + Q² only if PQ = QP. So (iv) is also false in general.\nTherefore only (ii) is true, matching option D."
