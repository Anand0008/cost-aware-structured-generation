        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the correct statement among four given properties of square matrices P and Q. Each statement needs to be evaluated based on fundamental rules of matrix algebra.\n\n**Statement (i): PQ = 0 implies P = 0 or Q = 0 or both**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. Unlike scalar multiplication, in matrix algebra, the product of two non-zero matrices can be a zero matrix. For example, let $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Neither P nor Q is a zero matrix, but $PQ = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$.\n\n**Statement (ii): PQ = I implies P = Q⁻¹**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. For square matrices P and Q of the same size, if their product $PQ = I$ (where I is the identity matrix), it means that Q is the right inverse of P. A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that for square matrices, if a right inverse exists, it is also the unique two-sided inverse. Therefore, $Q = P^{-1}$ and consequently $P = Q^{-1}$. This is supported by RAG Chunk 5, which defines the inverse and proves its uniqueness for square matrices.\n\n**Statement (iii): (P + Q)² = P² + 2PQ + Q²**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The expansion of $(P + Q)^2$ is $(P + Q)(P + Q) = P(P + Q) + Q(P + Q) = P^2 + PQ + QP + Q^2$. For the given statement to be true, it would require $PQ + QP = 2PQ$, which implies $QP = PQ$. However, matrix multiplication is generally **not commutative** ($PQ \\neq QP$). Therefore, this identity does not hold true for arbitrary square matrices.\n\n**Statement (iv): (P - Q)² = P² - 2PQ + Q²**\nThis statement is also **FALSE**. The expansion of $(P - Q)^2$ is $(P - Q)(P - Q) = P(P - Q) - Q(P - Q) = P^2 - PQ - QP + Q^2$. Similar to statement (iii), for this identity to hold, it would require $-PQ - QP = -2PQ$, which implies $QP = PQ$. Since matrix multiplication is generally not commutative, this identity is not true for arbitrary square matrices.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement (ii) is correct. Thus, option D is the correct choice."
