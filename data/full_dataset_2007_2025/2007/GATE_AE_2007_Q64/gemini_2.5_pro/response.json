The question asks for the angular positions where the speed along the surface is equal to the free stream speed, i.e., $V_s = U_{\\infty}$.\\n\\nSetting the two equal: $|-2 U_{\\infty} \\sin(\\theta)| = U_{\\infty}$.\\nDividing by $U_{\\infty}$ (assuming $U_{\\infty} \\neq 0$): $2 |\\sin(\\theta)| = 1$.\\nThis simplifies to $|\\sin(\\theta)| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\\n\\nThis condition is satisfied when $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\sin(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\\n\\nFor $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}$, the angles in the range $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}$ are $30^{\\circ}$ (first quadrant) and $150^{\\circ}$ (second quadrant, $180^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}$).\\n\\nFor $\\sin(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}$, the angles in the range $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}$ are $210^{\\circ}$ (third quadrant, $180^{\\circ} + 30^{\\circ}$) and $330^{\\circ}$ (fourth quadrant, $360^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}$).\\n\\nThus, the angular positions are $30^{\\circ}, 150^{\\circ}, 210^{\\circ}$, and $330^{\\circ}$. This matches option A. This is also consistent with the condition for $C_p=0$, as $C_p = 1 - (V_s/U_{\\infty})^2$, so $C_p=0$ implies $V_s = U_{\\infty}$ (as shown in RAG Chunk 3)."

          "Step 2: Recall the formula for the fluid velocity on the surface of a circular cylinder in a uniform stream of ideal fluid. For potential flow, the radial velocity component $u_r$ is zero at the surface ($r=R$), and the tangential velocity component $u_{\\theta}$ is given by $u_{\\theta}(r=R) = -2 U_{\\infty} \\sin(\\theta)$. The speed on the surface, $V_s$, is the magnitude of this tangential velocity: $V_s = |-2 U_{\\infty} \\sin(\\theta)| = 2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin(\\theta)|$.",
          "Step 3: Set up the condition given in the problem. We need to find $\\theta$ such that the surface speed $V_s$ is equal to the freestream speed $U_{\\infty}$. So, $2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin(\\theta)| = U_{\\infty}$.",
          "Step 4: Solve the equation for $|\\sin(\\theta)|$. Divide both sides by $U_{\\infty}$ (assuming $U_{\\infty} \\neq 0$): $2 |\\sin(\\theta)| = 1$, which gives $|\\sin(\\theta)| = \\frac{1}{2}$.",
          "Step 5: Determine the angles $\\theta$ that satisfy $|\\sin(\\theta)| = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\sin(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.",
