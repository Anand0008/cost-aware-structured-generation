The speed on the surface is |V_s| = |V_\\theta| = 2 U_\\infty |\\sin\\theta|. We want locations where this surface speed equals the freestream speed U_\\infty: 2 U_\\infty |\\sin\\theta| = U_\\infty. Cancel U_\\infty (nonzero), giving 2 |\\sin\\theta| = 1, so |\\sin\\theta| = 1/2. Thus \\sin\\theta = \\pm 1/2. Over 0^\\circ to 360^\\circ, this occurs at \\theta = 30^\\circ, 150^\\circ, 210^\\circ, 330^\\circ. The question measures angles relative to the forward stagnation point, which is at \\theta = 0^\\circ, so these are exactly the same numerical angles.

Recognize that C_p = 0 corresponds to p = p_\\infty, which via Bernoulli implies V = U_\\infty. Set C_p = 0, solve 1 - 4 \\sin^2\\theta = 0 ⇒ \\sin^2\\theta = 1/4 ⇒ \\sin\\theta = ±1/2, giving the same four angles.",
