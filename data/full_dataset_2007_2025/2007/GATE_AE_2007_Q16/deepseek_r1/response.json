This occurs after the freestream Mach number exceeds the critical Mach number (M_cr), which is the Mach number at which the flow first becomes sonic (M=1) at some point on the airfoil. Initially, for M∞ < M_cr, drag is nearly constant (equal to its incompressible value). Even for M∞ slightly above M_cr, where a weak supersonic bubble and shock form, drag does not increase dramatically. The sharp drag rise (divergence) begins at a higher Mach number, M_dd. Therefore, M_dd > M_cr always. Option A is false because M_dd depends on factors like angle of attack and Reynolds number. Option C is false because M_dd is greater than M_cr, not equal, even at zero angle of attack. Option D describes the critical Mach number, not the drag-divergence Mach number."

          "Step 4: For M∞ > M_cr, a supersonic flow region (bubble) forms, terminated by a weak shock wave. The drag coefficient does not increase significantly in this initial phase.",
          "Step 5: As M∞ increases further, the supersonic region expands and the terminating shock strengthens. At a specific M∞ = M_dd, the shock becomes strong enough to cause significant boundary layer separation and a sharp increase in pressure (wave) drag.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the relationship. Since the drag rise occurs due to phenomena (strong shocks, separation) that manifest only after the supersonic region has grown sufficiently beyond M_cr, M_dd is always greater than M_cr (M_dd > M_cr)."
