At this point, the drag coefficient ($\\text{c}_d$) remains nearly constant, close to its incompressible value (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5). The drag-divergence Mach number ($\\text{M}_{dd}$) is defined as the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient begins to rise sharply and suddenly (Chunks 4, 5, 6). This sharp increase is attributed to the strengthening of shock waves, leading to significant wave drag and boundary layer separation (Chunks 4, 5, 6). The RAG context clearly states that $\\text{M}_{dd}$ is 'slightly higher than $\\text{M}_{cr}$' (Chunks 1, 2). Therefore, option B, stating that the drag divergence Mach number is always higher than the critical Mach number, is correct."

At $\\text{M}_{cr}$, the drag coefficient has not yet significantly increased (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5).",
          "Step 2: Understand the Drag Divergence Mach Number ($\\text{M}_{dd}$). This is the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient of an airfoil begins to increase sharply and rapidly. This phenomenon is caused by the formation of strong shock waves on the airfoil surface, leading to wave drag and significant boundary layer separation (Chunks 4, 5, 6).",
          "Step 3: Compare $\\text{M}_{cr}$ and $\\text{M}_{dd}$. As the freestream Mach number increases beyond $\\text{M}_{cr}$, a small pocket of supersonic flow develops, terminated by a weak shock wave. The drag increase is still minimal. As the Mach number further increases, this supersonic region expands, and the terminating shock wave becomes much stronger, causing the sharp drag rise that defines $\\text{M}_{dd}$. Thus, $\\text{M}_{dd}$ always occurs at a higher Mach number than $\\text{M}_{cr}$ (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5).",
