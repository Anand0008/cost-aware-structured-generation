        "reasoning": "Both wings have the same chord c, but spans b and 4b. So their aspect ratios are AR_A = b^2/(bc) = b/c and AR_B = (4b)^2/(4bc) = 4b/c = 4 AR_A. For a finite wing in subsonic flow, the lift-curve slope a (dC_L/d\\alpha) increases with aspect ratio and approaches the 2D airfoil slope a_0 as AR \\to \\infty. However, the zero-lift angle of attack \\alpha_{L=0} is the same for the finite wing and its airfoil section, and is essentially independent of AR. At a given geometric angle of attack \\alpha, the lift coefficient is C_L = a(\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0}). For the higher-AR wing B, a is closer to a_0, but the effective angle of attack \\alpha_{eff} = \\alpha - \\alpha_i is smaller because induced angle \\alpha_i = C_L/(\\pi e AR) is smaller. When you solve the finite-wing relations consistently, the net result is that for a given geometric \\alpha, the total C_L of a finite wing is essentially independent of AR (for wings of the same airfoil and planform family). Anderson shows that the finite-wing lift curve plotted versus geometric \\alpha has the same intercept and nearly the same slope as the 2D airfoil when expressed properly; the main AR effect appears in induced drag, not in C_L at a fixed \\alpha. Therefore, wings A and B produce essentially the same lift coefficient at the same geometric angle of attack, so option A is correct. Options B and C incorrectly assume that higher AR directly changes C_L at fixed \\alpha in a simple monotonic way, and D is wrong because in the subsonic regime the Mach number does not reverse this conclusion for geometrically similar wings at the same \\alpha."

          "Step 3: The induced angle is related to lift and aspect ratio by \\alpha_i = C_L / (\\pi e AR). Increasing AR reduces \\alpha_i for a given C_L, so the effective angle is closer to the geometric angle.",
          "Step 4: When you combine these relations, the dependence of C_L on geometric \\alpha for a given airfoil and family of planforms is only weakly affected by AR; the zero-lift angle \\alpha_{L=0} is unchanged, and the finite-wing lift-curve slope versus geometric \\alpha remains essentially the same for practical AR values.",
          "Step 5: Therefore, at the same geometric angle of attack in subsonic flow, wings A and B will produce essentially the same lift coefficient. Hence option A is correct; B and C wrongly predict a systematic increase or decrease, and D incorrectly attributes the effect to Mach number."
