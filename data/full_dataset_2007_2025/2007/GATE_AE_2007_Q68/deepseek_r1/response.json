        "reasoning": "The design preference is for stall to begin at the wing root. Stall occurs when the local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) reaches the maximum lift coefficient ($c_{l_{max}}$) of the airfoil. Therefore, the wing with the highest $c_l$ at the root (y=0) and a decreasing $c_l$ towards the tips will stall at the root first. From the image description and typical distributions, curve P peaks away from the root (around $y/s = 0.4$), indicating its maximum $c_l$ is not at the root. Curve R, by elimination and typical knowledge, shows a distribution with maximum $c_l$ at the root, monotonically decreasing to the tips (resembling an elliptical or near-elliptical distribution). Thus, wing R satisfies the designer's requirement."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the design criterion. Stall begins at the wing section where the local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) first reaches the airfoil's maximum lift coefficient ($c_{l_{max}}$). For stall to begin at the root, the root must have the highest $c_l$ value across the span at any given wing angle of attack.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the given span-wise lift distributions. The graph plots $c_l$ vs. normalized span coordinate $y/s$. The shape indicates how $c_l$ varies from root ($y/s = 0$) to tip ($y/s = \\pm 0.5$).",
          "Step 3: Relate distribution shape to stall onset. A distribution that peaks at the root (highest $c_l$ at $y/s=0$) and decreases continuously towards the tips ensures the root reaches $c_{l_{max}}$ first as the overall wing $C_L$ increases.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each curve based on the image description and typical patterns. Curve P has its peak away from the root (around $y/s = 0.4$), so its root $c_l$ is lower than the inboard peak. Stall would likely begin inboard, not at the very root. Curve Q (not described in detail, but from typical graphs) often represents a more uniform or rectangular wing distribution, where $c_l$ is nearly constant or has a mild peak slightly inboard. Curve R typically represents a distribution with maximum at the root (like an elliptical distribution).",
          "Step 5: Select the wing. Wing R, with its maximum $c_l$ at the root, will stall at the root first, meeting the designer's preference."
