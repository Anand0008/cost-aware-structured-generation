        "reasoning": "Stall occurs when the local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) at any point on the wing exceeds its maximum possible value ($c_{l,max}$) for that specific airfoil section. For a designer who prefers stall to begin at the wing root ($y/s = 0$), the root section must be the first to reach its $c_{l,max}$ as the wing's angle of attack (and consequently, the overall wing lift coefficient $C_L$) increases. This implies that, for a given $C_L$, the local $c_l$ at the root must be proportionally higher compared to other sections along the span.\n\nThe provided figure plots the ratio $c_l / C_L$ against the normalized spanwise coordinate $y/s$. A higher value of $c_l / C_L$ at a particular spanwise location indicates that this section is operating at a relatively higher local lift coefficient compared to the overall wing lift. Therefore, the section with the highest $c_l / C_L$ ratio at the root ($y/s = 0$) will be the first to reach its $c_{l,max}$ and initiate stall.\n\nLet's analyze the values at $y/s = 0$ from the graph:\n*   For curve P: $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.8$\n*   For curve Q: $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.9$\n*   For curve R: $c_l / C_L \\approx 1.1$\n\nCurve R exhibits the highest value of $c_l / C_L$ at the wing root ($y/s = 0$). This means that for wing R, the root section is generating a proportionally higher lift compared to the overall wing lift. Consequently, as the angle of attack increases, the root section of wing R will reach its critical lift coefficient ($c_{l,max}$) before any other section, causing stall to begin at the root. This is a desirable characteristic in aircraft design for maintaining control and stability during stall."

          "**Step 3: Relate stall location to lift distribution.** For stall to begin at the root, the root section must be the first part of the wing to reach its $c_{l,max}$ as the aircraft's angle of attack (and thus the total wing lift coefficient $C_L$) increases. This implies that the root section must be operating at a relatively higher $c_l$ compared to other sections along the span.",
          "**Step 4: Interpret the graph's axes.** The y-axis represents the ratio $c_l / C_L$, which indicates the local section lift coefficient normalized by the total wing lift coefficient. The x-axis represents the normalized spanwise position $y/s$, where $y/s = 0$ is the wing root and $y/s = 1$ is the wing tip.",
          "**Step 5: Analyze the value of $c_l / C_L$ at the wing root ($y/s = 0$) for each curve.**\n    *   For curve P, at $y/s = 0$, $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.8$.\n    *   For curve Q, at $y/s = 0$, $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.9$.\n    *   For curve R, at $y/s = 0$, $c_l / C_L \\approx 1.1$.",
          "**Step 6: Identify the wing that meets the design objective.** Wing R has the highest $c_l / C_L$ value at the root ($y/s = 0$). This means its root section is generating proportionally more lift than the root sections of wings P and Q. Therefore, as the wing approaches stall, the root section of wing R will reach its $c_{l,max}$ first, causing stall to initiate at the root. This makes wing R the preferred choice for the designer."
