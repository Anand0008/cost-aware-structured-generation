For a given overall wing lift coefficient \\(C_L\\), the distribution of \\(c_l/C_L\\) along the span determines which part of the wing is most highly loaded relative to the average. The region with the highest \\(c_l/C_L\\) will reach \\(c_{l,stall}\\) first and therefore stall first. To have stall begin at the root (wing center), we want the root to have the largest normalized section lift coefficient, and the tip to be relatively lightly loaded so that it stalls later. From the figure, curve R has the highest \\(c_l/C_L\\) at the root (around 1.2) and decreases monotonically towards the tip, where it is the lowest among the three. Curves P and Q both have lower root loading and higher loading toward mid-span or tip, which would cause stall to start away from the root. Therefore, a designer who prefers root-first stall will choose wing R, matching option C."

A designer prefers to use a wing for which the stall begins at the root. Which of the wings will he choose?"
