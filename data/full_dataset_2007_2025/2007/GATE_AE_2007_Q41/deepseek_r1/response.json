This extra energy allows fluid particles to resist slowing down and reversing direction when encountering an adverse pressure gradient ($\\frac{dp}{dx} > 0$), thus delaying separation. This is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 5, 6). Option B is false: laminar boundary layers have lower skin friction drag, not higher. Option C is false: turbulence increases the effective eddy viscosity, enhancing momentum transfer but not reducing viscosity. Option D is false: turbulent boundary layers are thicker but have steeper velocity gradients at the wall ($\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n}$ is larger), leading to higher viscous losses (skin friction), not less."
