Turbulent boundary layers have stronger mixing, bringing high-momentum fluid from the outer region closer to the wall, giving the near-wall fluid more kinetic energy. This makes the turbulent boundary layer more energetic and more resistant to separation, so it remains attached over a longer distance. This is exactly what option A states.\\n\\nChecking other options:\\nB. Laminar boundary layers actually have *less* skin friction than turbulent ones at the same Reynolds number, so they do not slow down more rapidly because of higher friction. This is incorrect.\\nC. Turbulence increases effective viscosity (eddy viscosity), not reduces it. Increased mixing increases momentum transfer and skin friction. So this statement is physically wrong.\\nD. Turbulent boundary layers are thicker, but they have *steeper* velocity gradients at the wall and hence *higher* viscous losses (skin friction), not smaller. So this is also incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, A is the only option consistent with boundary layer theory and the standard explanation in Anderson and similar texts."
