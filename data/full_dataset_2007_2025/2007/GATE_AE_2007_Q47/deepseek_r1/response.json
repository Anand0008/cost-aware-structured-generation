        "reasoning": "For an impulse turbine with identical stages, the rotor blades are typically identical in shape. The 'absolute inlet blade angle' given (37°) refers to the geometric angle of the rotor blade at inlet measured from the turbine axis. Since the stages are identical, the rotor blade's exit geometric angle is the same as its inlet geometric angle. Therefore, the absolute exit blade angle is also 37°. This matches option B. The stator exit angle (70°) is a distractor; the key is recognizing that blade angles, not flow angles, are asked for and that identical stages imply identical blade geometry."

          "Step 2: Understand the context of 'identical stages'. In a multistage impulse turbine with identical stages, each stage is the same. This implies that the rotor blades are identical in shape from stage to stage.",
          "Step 3: Apply the condition of identical rotor blades. For a given rotor blade, if the inlet geometric angle is 37°, and the blade is symmetric (common in impulse turbines) or simply has the same angle at exit due to identical stage design, the exit geometric angle will also be 37° (or its mirror; but magnitude-wise 37°).",
