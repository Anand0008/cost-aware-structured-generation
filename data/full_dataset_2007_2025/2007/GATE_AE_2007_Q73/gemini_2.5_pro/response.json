        "reasoning": "The question asks for the center of gravity (CG) location where `d\\delta_e/dC_L = 0`. According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 3), the Stick Fixed Neutral Point (N0) is defined as the CG location where the rate of change of elevator deflection for trim with respect to the lift coefficient, `d(\\delta_e)/dC_L_trim`, is approximately zero. Therefore, the question is essentially asking for the neutral point of the airplane.\n\nTo find the neutral point (`X_{NP}`), we use the given information from the wind tunnel test:\n1.  For `\\bar{X}_{CG} = 0.3`, `dC_m/dC_L = -0.1`.\n2.  The relation `dC_m/dC_L = -SM` holds true, where `SM` is the static margin.\n3.  The static margin is also defined as `SM = (X_{NP} - X_{CG}) / \\bar{c}` (Chunk 1).\n\nCombining these, we have the fundamental relationship (from Chunk 1 and 2):\n`dC_m/dC_L = \\bar{X}_{CG} - \\bar{X}_{NP}`\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n`-0.1 = 0.3 - \\bar{X}_{NP}`\n\nSolving for `\\bar{X}_{NP}`:\n`\\bar{X}_{NP} = 0.3 + 0.1`\n`\\bar{X}_{NP} = 0.4`\n\nSince the CG location where `d\\delta_e/dC_L = 0` is the neutral point, the required CG location is `0.4 \\bar{c}`. This matches option D."
