Therefore, the static margin SM at that CG is 0.1. Since SM = X_NP - X_CG, we have 0.1 = X_NP - 0.3, solving gives X_NP = 0.4.

The retrieved knowledge from video notes by Prof. Ghosh provided clear physical intuition and the experimental method. This allowed for a confident and accurate solution."
