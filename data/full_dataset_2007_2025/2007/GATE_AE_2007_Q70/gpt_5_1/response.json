Let x = x_0 + \\(\\delta x\\) with x_0 = \\(\\pi/4\\) and \\(\\delta x\\) small. Linearize cos x about x_0 using Taylor expansion: cos x \\(\\approx\\) cos x_0 - sin x_0 (x - x_0). Here cos(\\(\\pi/4\\)) = 1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and sin(\\(\\pi/4\\)) = 1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Substituting x = x_0 + \\(\\delta x\\): cos x \\(\\approx\\) 1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) - (1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\))\\(\\delta x\\). The constant term 1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) does not affect the dynamics of the perturbation (it can be absorbed into the equilibrium condition), so the perturbation equation keeps only the term proportional to \\(\\delta x\\): 2\\(\\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt}\\) - (1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\))\\(\\delta x\\) = 0. Renaming \\(\\delta x\\) as x in the approximate equation, we get 2\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) - (1/\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)) x = 0, which corresponds to option B. Option A simply replaces cos x by sin x without any justification from linearization around \\(\\pi/4\\), so it is not the correct small-perturbation approximation. The official key lists A, but mathematically the correct linearized equation is B; thus, while acknowledging the key, the correct physics/maths-based answer is B."
