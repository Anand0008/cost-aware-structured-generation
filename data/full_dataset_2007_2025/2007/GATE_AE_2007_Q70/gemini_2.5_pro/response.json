        "reasoning": "The problem asks for a linearized approximation of the non-linear differential equation $2\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\cos x = 0$ for small perturbations about $x = \\pi/4$.\\n\\nThe standard method for linearization involves a Taylor series expansion around the operating point $x_0 = \\pi/4$.\\nLet $x = x_0 + \\delta x$, where $x_0 = \\pi/4$ and $\\delta x$ is a small perturbation.\\nThen, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d(x_0 + \\delta x)}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt}$ (since $x_0$ is a constant, its derivative is zero).\\n\\nThe non-linear term is $\\cos x$. Using Taylor series expansion for $f(x)$ around $x_0$:\\n$f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$\\nHere, $f(x) = \\cos x$, so $f'(x) = -\\sin x$.\\nAt $x_0 = \\pi/4$:\\n$f(x_0) = \\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\\n$f'(x_0) = -\\sin(\\pi/4) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\\nSubstituting these into the Taylor expansion:\\n$\\cos x \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - \\frac{\\pi}{4})$\\nNow, substitute this and $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt}$ into the original differential equation:\\n$2\\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 0$\\nReplacing $(x - \\pi/4)$ with $\\delta x$:\\n$2\\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\delta x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0$\\nThis is the correctly linearized differential equation in terms of the perturbation $\\delta x$. If we denote the perturbation variable as $x$ (a common convention), the equation is:\\n$2\\frac{dx}{dt} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0$\\n\\nComparing this with the given options:\\nA. $2(dx/dt) + \\sin x = 0$: This equation is still non-linear (due to $\\sin x$) and therefore cannot be a linearized approximation. A linearized equation must be linear.\\nB. $2(dx/dt) - (1/\\sqrt{2})x = 0$: This matches the homogeneous part of the correctly derived linearized equation ($2\\frac{dx}{dt} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x = 0$) if the constant term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ is ignored. While omitting the constant term is sometimes done when focusing solely on the dynamic stability of the perturbation, it is not a complete linearization.\\nC. $(dx/dt) + \\cos x = 0$: Still non-linear and has a different coefficient for the derivative term.\\nD. $(dx/dt) + x = 0$: Incorrect coefficients.\\n\\nBased on standard linearization principles, none of the options perfectly match the derived linear equation. Option A is fundamentally incorrect as a linearized approximation because it is non-linear. Option B is the closest linear approximation if the constant term is disregarded.\\nHowever, as per the instructions to validate the provided answer key, the answer is marked as A. This indicates a potential discrepancy between standard engineering principles and the intended answer for this specific question."
