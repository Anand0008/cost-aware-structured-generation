The tail lift coefficient derivative with respect to angle of attack, C_{L_\\alpha t}, does not depend on the tail arm l_t, but the pitching moment about the CG is L_t l_t. Non-dimensionalizing by q S c_\\bar gives a factor l_t/c_\\bar. Thus the tail contribution to \\partial C_m/\\partial \\alpha is directly proportional to l_t (first power). If l_t is doubled, the derivative doubles. Therefore the new value is two times the original, matching option A."

          "Step 2: The lift on the tail is L_t = q S_t C_{L,t}, and for small angles C_{L,t} \\approx C_{L_\\alpha t} \\alpha_{eff}, so the derivative of tail lift with respect to angle of attack is proportional to C_{L_\\alpha t}. This does not involve l_t.",
          "Step 3: The dimensional pitching moment derivative due to the tail is \\partial M_t/\\partial \\alpha = - (\\partial L_t/\\partial \\alpha) l_t, so it is proportional to l_t.",
          "Step 4: The pitching moment coefficient is C_m = M / (q S c_\\bar). Therefore, \\partial C_m/\\partial \\alpha (tail) = (1/(q S c_\\bar)) (\\partial M_t/\\partial \\alpha) \\propto l_t / c_\\bar.",
          "Step 5: Since all other quantities (S_t, S, c_\\bar, C_{L_\\alpha t}, downwash factor, etc.) are unchanged, the tail contribution to \\partial C_m/\\partial \\alpha scales linearly with l_t. Doubling l_t doubles \\partial C_m/\\partial \\alpha.",

Another chunk discussed C_mq with l_t^2 dependence, which was useful to highlight a common confusion but not directly needed. Overall, RAG was moderately helpful; the core proportionality result came from standard stability theory."
