          "Step 2: Recall or identify the formula for the horizontal tail's contribution to $\\frac{\\partial C_M}{\\partial \\alpha}$. From aircraft stability principles (and specifically from Chunk 4 of the retrieved knowledge), this is given by: $\\frac{\\partial C_{M_{tail}}}{\\partial \\alpha} = - C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}} \\left( \\frac{l_t}{c_{bar}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{S_t}{S_w} \\right) (1 - \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial \\alpha})$.",

All these are assumed to remain constant for the given problem, except for $l_t$, the tail moment arm.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the proportionality. The formula clearly shows that $\\frac{\\partial C_{M_{tail}}}{\\partial \\alpha}$ is directly proportional to $l_t$. That is, $\\frac{\\partial C_{M_{tail}}}{\\partial \\alpha} \\propto l_t$.",
