        "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is the freestream Mach number at which sonic flow first appears on the airfoil surface. A thicker airfoil causes greater flow acceleration and a more negative incompressible pressure coefficient ($C_{p,0}$), leading to a lower $M_{cr}$. Conversely, a thinner airfoil perturbs the flow less, has a less negative $C_{p,0}$, and thus achieves a higher $M_{cr}$. To enable efficient high-speed subsonic (transonic) flight without encountering severe wave drag, aircraft are designed with thin airfoils to push $M_{cr}$ as high as possible. This principle is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5)."
