        "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is defined as the freestream Mach number at which the local Mach number at some point on the airfoil surface first reaches Mach 1. For high-speed subsonic airplanes, it is desirable to have a high $M_{cr}$ to delay the onset of compressibility effects, such as wave drag. As explained in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5), thinner airfoils cause less acceleration of the airflow over their surfaces compared to thicker airfoils. This means that for a given freestream Mach number, the local Mach number on a thin airfoil will be lower than on a thick airfoil. Consequently, a higher freestream Mach number is required for the local flow on a thin airfoil to reach sonic speed, resulting in a higher critical Mach number. Therefore, high-speed subsonic airplanes are designed with thin airfoils to maximize their critical Mach number and allow for efficient flight at higher speeds before significant drag rise occurs."

          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of airfoil thickness on local flow acceleration. A thicker airfoil creates a larger disturbance and greater acceleration of the airflow over its curved surfaces (especially the upper surface). This leads to a more negative pressure coefficient ($C_p$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of airfoil thickness on $M_{cr}$. Due to greater flow acceleration, a thicker airfoil will reach $M_{local}=1$ at a lower freestream Mach number compared to a thinner airfoil. Conversely, a thinner airfoil causes less flow acceleration, meaning it requires a higher freestream Mach number for the local flow to become sonic.",
          "Step 5: Conclude the optimal design choice. To achieve a high critical Mach number, which is desired for high-speed subsonic flight, airfoils should be designed to be thin. This delays the formation of local supersonic regions and the associated drag rise."
