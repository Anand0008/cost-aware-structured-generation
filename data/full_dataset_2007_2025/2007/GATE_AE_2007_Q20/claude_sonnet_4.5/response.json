The retrieved knowledge indicates that thin airfoils have a higher critical Mach number compared to thick airfoils. This is because thin airfoils cause less flow acceleration over the top surface, resulting in a less negative pressure coefficient and a higher critical Mach number. Therefore, high-speed subsonic airplanes are usually designed with thin airfoils (option B) to maximize their cruise speed before encountering significant compressibility drag."
