        "reasoning": "The roll derivative Cl_beta (\\u2202Cl/\\u2202\\u03b2) from the vertical tail depends on its vertical position relative to the aircraft's roll axis. From retrieved knowledge (chunks 1, 2, 4, 6), a conventional vertical tail above the roll axis contributes a negative Cl_beta (stabilizing), while a vertical tail below the roll axis contributes a positive Cl_beta (destabilizing). When the vertical tail is inverted and placed below the horizontal tail, it is below the roll axis, so its contribution to Cl_beta is positive. This aligns with the formula $C_{l_\\beta, VT} = - \\frac{z_{VT}}{b} C_{Y_\\beta, VT, eff}$ where $z_{VT}$ is negative for tail below, making $C_{l_\\beta, VT}$ positive."

          "Step 2: Recognize that the vertical tail contributes to $C_{l_\\beta}$ based on its vertical position relative to the roll axis (often the fuselage centerline).",
          "Step 3: Recall from aerodynamics: for a conventional vertical tail above the roll axis, a positive sideslip \\u03b2 generates a side force on the tail to the left (negative Y-direction), and with the tail above (positive vertical arm), this creates a negative rolling moment, contributing negative $C_{l_\\beta}$.",
          "Step 4: For the given scenario, the vertical tail is inverted and placed below the horizontal tail, meaning it is below the roll axis. Thus, the vertical distance $z_{VT}$ from the roll axis is negative.",
          "Step 5: Apply the principle: with $z_{VT}$ negative, the side force during sideslip now produces a rolling moment of opposite sign compared to tail above. Specifically, for positive \\u03b2, side force leftward on a tail below creates a positive rolling moment, contributing positive $C_{l_\\beta}$.",
