        "reasoning": "For lateral static stability (dihedral effect), the aircraft needs a negative \\(C_{l\\beta} = \\partial C_l/\\partial \\beta\\). A conventional vertical tail located above the roll axis contributes a *negative* \\(C_{l\\beta}\\) (stabilizing). From the RAG (Chunks 1, 2, 4), the vertical tail contribution to roll derivative is proportional to its vertical offset from the roll axis: \\(C_{l\\beta,VT} \\propto (z_{VT}/b) C_{Y\\beta,VT,eff}\\). When the tail is above the roll axis (\\(z_{VT} > 0\\)), its contribution is negative (stabilizing). If we invert the vertical tail and put it *below* the horizontal tail and below the roll axis, the sign of \\(z_{VT}\\) reverses (\\(z_{VT} < 0\\)), so the sign of its rolling-moment contribution reverses. Thus a component that was giving negative \\(C_{l\\beta}\\) now gives positive \\(C_{l\\beta}\\). Therefore, the contribution of the inverted vertical tail to \\(\\partial C_l/\\partial \\beta\\) becomes positive. This matches the official key (Option B)."

          "Step 2: From the RAG (Chunks 1, 2, 4), the vertical tail produces a side force in sideslip, and if its aerodynamic center is vertically offset from the roll axis, this side force creates a rolling moment. The sign of this contribution depends on the sign of the vertical offset.",
          "Step 3: For a conventional configuration with the vertical tail above the fuselage/roll axis (\\(z_{VT} > 0\\)), a positive sideslip (\\(\\beta > 0\\), wind from the right) produces a side force on the tail that generates a *negative* rolling moment (stabilizing). Hence the vertical tail contribution to \\(C_{l\\beta}\\) is negative.",
          "Step 4: If we invert the vertical tail and place it below the horizontal tail and below the roll axis, the vertical distance \\(z_{VT}\\) changes sign (now \\(z_{VT} < 0\\)). The side-force derivative \\(C_{Y\\beta,VT}\\) due to sideslip does not change sign just because we flipped the tail; the flow physics in yaw/sideslip are the same.",
          "Step 5: Since the rolling moment contribution is proportional to \\(z_{VT}\\), changing \\(z_{VT}\\) from positive to negative reverses the sign of the vertical tail contribution to \\(C_{l\\beta}\\). What was negative becomes positive (destabilizing).",

For a positive sideslip, draw the side force on the tail and then use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the rolling moment. Compare the moment direction for the tail above vs below to infer the sign change in C_{l\\beta}.",

Chunk 6 reinforced the sign of C_L_beta for stability. The context was highly relevant and sufficient; only standard textbook knowledge was added for broader framing."
