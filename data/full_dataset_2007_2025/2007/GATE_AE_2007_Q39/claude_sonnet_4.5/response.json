        "reasoning": "The question asks about the effect of inverting the vertical tail (placing it below the horizontal tail) on the rolling moment derivative (Cl_beta). Based on the principles of lateral stability and the vertical tail's contribution to Cl_beta, inverting the vertical tail will make its contribution positive.\n\nTypically, for a conventional aircraft with the vertical tail above the roll axis, the vertical tail's contribution to Cl_beta is negative, which is stabilizing. This is because the side force generated on the vertical tail during a sideslip creates a rolling moment that tends to restore the aircraft to level flight (right wing down for positive sideslip).\n\nHowever, if the vertical tail is placed below the roll axis, the side force on the vertical tail will create a rolling moment that is destabilizing (right wing up for positive sideslip). Therefore, the contribution of the inverted vertical tail to Cl_beta will be positive, which matches the correct answer B."
