        "reasoning": "The roll derivative due to sideslip, $\\partial C_l / \\partial \\beta$ (or $C_{l\\beta}$), represents the change in rolling moment coefficient for a given change in sideslip angle. For an aircraft to possess positive lateral static stability, $C_{l\\beta}$ must be negative. This means a positive sideslip ($\\beta > 0$, wind from the right) should generate a negative (restoring) rolling moment (right wing down).\n\nLet's analyze the vertical tail's contribution:\n1.  **Sideslip Effect**: When an aircraft experiences a positive sideslip ($\\beta > 0$), the relative wind comes from the right. The vertical tail, acting as a fin, experiences an effective angle of attack from the right. This generates an aerodynamic side force ($F_Y$) on the vertical tail directed towards the left (negative Y-direction in the aircraft body axis system). So, $F_Y < 0$.\n2.  **Vertical Tail Position**: The question states the vertical tail is \"inverted and put below the horizontal tail.\" This implies that the aerodynamic center of the vertical tail is now located *below* the aircraft's roll axis. If we define $Z_t$ as the vertical distance of the vertical tail's aerodynamic center from the roll axis (positive upwards), then for this configuration, $Z_t$ is negative ($Z_t < 0$).\n3.  **Rolling Moment Generation**: The rolling moment ($L$) generated by this side force is given by $L = F_Y \\times Z_t$.\n    Substituting the signs: $L = (negative) \\times (negative) = positive$.\n4.  **Contribution to $C_{l\\beta}$**: A positive rolling moment ($L > 0$) for a positive sideslip ($\\beta > 0$) means that the contribution to $C_{l\\beta} = \\partial C_l / \\partial \\beta$ is positive. A positive $C_{l\\beta}$ is a destabilizing contribution to lateral stability.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 6) which explicitly states that a high vertical tail contributes to a negative (stabilizing) $C_{l\\beta}$, while a low vertical tail contributes to a positive (destabilizing) $C_{l\\beta}$. Therefore, the correct answer is positive."
