To find the equivalent airspeed, we can use the relationship between true airspeed (V), equivalent airspeed (Ve), and air density (ρ) at different altitudes:\n\nVe = V * sqrt(ρ / ρ_SL)\n\nWhere ρ_SL is the standard sea-level air density (1.225 kg/m^3) and ρ is the air density at 5 km altitude (0.74 kg/m^3).\n\nGiven:\n- True airspeed (V) at 5 km altitude during maximum rate of climb = unknown\n- Air density (ρ) at 5 km altitude = 0.74 kg/m^3\n- Air density (ρ_SL) at sea level = 1.225 kg/m^3\n\nSolving for the equivalent airspeed (Ve):\nVe = V * sqrt(0.74 / 1.225) = V * 0.775\n\nThe question states that the maximum rate of climb at sea level was 4 m/s. Since the shaft power available is proportional to ambient density, the maximum rate of climb at 5 km altitude would be:\nRate of climb at 5 km = 4 m/s * (0.74 / 1.225) = 2.42 m/s\n\nFrom the graph, the true airspeed (V) corresponding to the maximum rate of climb at 5 km altitude is approximately 82 m/s.\nTherefore, the equivalent airspeed (Ve) is:\nVe = 82 m/s * 0.775 = 63.7 m/s\n\nThis matches the correct answer option B."
