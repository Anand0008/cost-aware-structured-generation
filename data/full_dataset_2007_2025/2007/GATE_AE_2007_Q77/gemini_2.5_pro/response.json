        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the equivalent airspeed (EAS) during maximum rate of climb at 5 km altitude. This requires a multi-step calculation:\n1.  **Calculate Power Available at Sea Level ($P_{A,SL}$):** The problem states that the maximum climb rate at sea level ($R/C_{max,SL}$) is 4 m/s. For a piston propeller airplane with shaft power available independent of speed, the maximum rate of climb occurs at the speed corresponding to the minimum power required ($P_{R,min,SL}$). From the graph, $P_{R,min,SL} = 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W}$. The power available is then $P_{A,SL} = P_{R,min,SL} + W \\times R/C_{max,SL} = 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W} + 20000 \\text{ N} \\times 4 \\text{ m/s} = 13 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W}$.\n2.  **Calculate Power Available at 5 km Altitude ($P_{A,5km}$):** Shaft power available is proportional to ambient density. So, $P_{A,5km} = P_{A,SL} \\times (\\rho_{5km} / \\rho_{SL}) = 13 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W} \\times (0.74 \\text{ kg/m}^3 / 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3) \\approx 7.853 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W}$.\n3.  **Calculate Maximum Rate of Climb at 5 km Altitude ($R/C_{max,5km}$):** From the graph, the minimum power required at 5 km altitude ($P_{R,min,5km}$) is approximately $5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W}$ (reading the lowest point of the dashed curve). The maximum rate of climb at 5 km is $R/C_{max,5km} = (P_{A,5km} - P_{R,min,5km}) / W = (7.853 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W} - 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ W}) / 20000 \\text{ N} \\approx 1.4265 \\text{ m/s}$.\n4.  **Calculate True Airspeed at 5 km Altitude ($V_{5km}$):** The climb angle ($\\gamma$) is given by $\\gamma = \\theta - \\alpha$, where $\\theta$ is the pitch angle and $\\alpha$ is the angle of attack. So, $\\gamma = 5^\\circ - 4^\\circ = 1^\\circ$. The rate of climb is also given by $R/C = V \\sin \\gamma$. Therefore, $V_{5km} = R/C_{max,5km} / \\sin \\gamma = 1.4265 \\text{ m/s} / \\sin(1^\\circ) \\approx 1.4265 / 0.0174524 \\approx 81.738 \\text{ m/s}$.\n5.  **Calculate Equivalent Airspeed ($V_{EAS}$):** The equivalent airspeed is given by $V_{EAS} = V_{5km} \\sqrt{\\rho_{5km} / \\rho_{SL}} = 81.738 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\sqrt{0.74 \\text{ kg/m}^3 / 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3} \\approx 81.738 \\times 0.777226 \\approx 63.53 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThis calculated value of $63.53 \\text{ m/s}$ is closest to option B, $63.7 \\text{ m/s}$. The slight difference is due to rounding and precise graph reading."
