        "reasoning": "The laminar boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ on a flat plate held parallel to the freestream is governed by the Blasius solution.

Substituting the expression for $\\text{Re}_x$ into the $\\delta$ formula, we get:\n\n$\\delta = \\frac{5.0x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty x}{\\mu_\\infty}}} = 5.0x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty x}} = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty x^2}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty x}} = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty x}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty}}$\n\nSince the freestream fluid properties (density $\\rho_\\infty$, velocity $V_\\infty$, and dynamic viscosity $\\mu_\\infty$) are constant, the term $5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty}}$ is a constant. Therefore, the laminar boundary layer thickness is directly proportional to the square root of the distance from the leading edge:\n\n$\\delta \\propto \\sqrt{x}$\n\nThis proportionality can be used to find the new thickness:\n$\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}}$\n\nGiven:\n$\\delta_1 = 5 \\text{ mm}$ at $x_1 = 0.2 \\text{ m}$\nFind $\\delta_2$ at $x_2 = 0.8 \\text{ m}$\n\n$\\delta_2 = \\delta_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8 \\text{ m}}{0.2 \\text{ m}}} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\sqrt{4} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ mm}$"

Since the freestream conditions ($\\rho_\\infty, V_\\infty, \\mu_\\infty$) are constant for the flow, the term $5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty}}$ is a constant.
