By the First Law of Thermodynamics (energy conservation), the total enthalpy (h0) remains constant. For a calorically perfect gas, total temperature (T0) is directly proportional to h0, thus T0 remains constant. However, the shock is an irreversible process (high gradients cause viscous dissipation and thermal conduction), leading to an entropy increase. By the Second Law of Thermodynamics, this irreversibility causes a loss in the flow's work potential, which is measured by a decrease in total pressure (p0). This is a fundamental and well-established result in gas dynamics."
