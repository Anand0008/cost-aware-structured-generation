        "reasoning": "Across a normal shock wave, the flow process is adiabatic, meaning no heat is added to or removed from the flow. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady, adiabatic flow with no shaft work, the total enthalpy ($\\text{h}_0$) remains constant. For a calorically perfect gas, this implies that the total temperature ($\\text{T}_0$) also remains constant ($\\text{T}_{0,1} = \\text{T}_{0,2}$). However, a normal shock is an irreversible process due to viscous dissipation and thermal conduction within its very thin structure. This irreversibility leads to an increase in entropy ($\\Delta s > 0$) across the shock. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that for an irreversible adiabatic process, entropy must increase. An increase in entropy across a shock is directly linked to a decrease in the total pressure ($\\text{p}_0$), which represents a loss in the useful work potential of the flow ($\\text{p}_{0,2} < \\text{p}_{0,1}$). Therefore, total temperature remains constant, but total pressure decreases, which corresponds to option D."

          "**Step 1: Understand the nature of a normal shock.** A normal shock is an extremely thin discontinuity that occurs in supersonic flows, causing an abrupt change in flow properties. It is characterized as an adiabatic but irreversible process.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze Total Temperature ($\\text{T}_0$).** The process across a shock is considered adiabatic because it happens so quickly that there is no time for significant heat transfer to or from the fluid. For a steady, adiabatic flow with no external work, the total energy (represented by total enthalpy, $\\text{h}_0$) is conserved. For an ideal gas, $\\text{h}_0 = \\text{c}_p \\text{T}_0$. Therefore, if $\\text{h}_0$ is constant, $\\text{T}_0$ must also be constant across the shock ($\\text{T}_{0,1} = \\text{T}_{0,2}$).",
          "**Step 3: Analyze Total Pressure ($\\text{p}_0$).** The shock process involves strong compression and is inherently irreversible due to viscous effects and thermal conduction within the shock structure. Irreversibility leads to an increase in entropy ($\\text{s}_2 > \\text{s}_1$). According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, for an adiabatic process, entropy must increase or remain constant; for an irreversible process, it must increase. An increase in entropy is always accompanied by a decrease in total pressure ($\\text{p}_{0,2} < \\text{p}_{0,1}$). Total pressure represents the maximum useful work that can be extracted from the flow, and this potential is lost due to irreversibilities.",
