        "reasoning": "To achieve a steady, level flight at a higher speed, two primary conditions must be met:\n1.  **Thrust equals Drag (T = D):** As speed increases, drag generally increases significantly. To overcome this increased drag and maintain a constant speed, the engine thrust must be increased. This is achieved by increasing the engine throttle.\n2.  **Lift equals Weight (L = W):** For level flight, lift must balance weight. The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. If the speed ($V$) increases while weight ($W$), air density ($\\rho$), and wing area ($S$) remain constant, the lift coefficient ($C_L$) must decrease to maintain $L=W$. A decrease in $C_L$ implies a change in the aircraft's angle of attack ($\\alpha$).\n3.  **Zero Pitching Moment (Trim):** The aircraft must be trimmed at the new flight condition (new speed, new $C_L$, new $\\alpha$). As stated in the RAG context (Chunk 1, 5, 6), changing the aircraft's equilibrium velocity (and thus $C_L$) requires changing its pitching moment curve, which is achieved by deflecting the elevator. The elevator deflection ($\\delta_e$) is crucial to achieve zero pitching moment at the new $C_L$ and maintain the desired pitch attitude without continuous pilot input. Without re-trimming with the elevator, the aircraft would experience an unbalanced pitching moment and would not maintain steady level flight.\n\nTherefore, both increasing throttle (for thrust) and adjusting the elevator (for trim at the new $C_L$) are necessary to achieve a steady, level flight at a higher speed."

          "Step 1: Understand the initial condition. The airplane is in steady level flight, meaning Lift = Weight and Thrust = Drag, and it is trimmed (zero pitching moment) at a certain speed.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the requirement for 'higher speed' while maintaining 'steady level flight'. A higher speed ($V$) will increase the aerodynamic drag ($D$). To maintain steady flight (Thrust = Drag), the engine thrust must be increased. This is achieved by increasing the engine throttle.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the requirement for 'level flight' at a higher speed. For level flight, Lift ($L$) must equal Weight ($W$). The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. If $V$ increases and $L$ (which equals $W$) remains constant, then the lift coefficient ($C_L$) must decrease. A change in $C_L$ implies a change in the aircraft's angle of attack ($\\alpha$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the requirement for 'trimmed' flight at the new condition. Since the $C_L$ (and $\\alpha$) has changed, the aircraft's pitching moment characteristics will also change. To re-establish a zero pitching moment (trim) at the new $C_L$ and $\\alpha$, the elevator must be deflected. As per RAG (Chunk 1, 5, 6), elevator deflection is essential to trim the aircraft at different velocities and angles of attack.",
          "Step 5: Combine the requirements. To achieve a steady, level flight at a higher speed, both increased thrust (via throttle) to overcome increased drag and elevator adjustment (to re-trim for the new $C_L$) are necessary. Therefore, changing throttle and elevator together is the correct approach."
