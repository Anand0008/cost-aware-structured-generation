        "reasoning": "In steady level flight, trim requires lift equal to weight (L = W) and thrust equal to drag (T = D), with zero pitching moment (C_M = 0). To achieve a higher speed at the same altitude and weight, from the lift equation $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L = W$, if V increases, $C_L$ must decrease to maintain L = W. Decreasing $C_L$ requires reducing the angle of attack, which is achieved by deflecting the elevator (typically downward for conventional aircraft). Simultaneously, drag generally increases with speed, so thrust must be increased via throttle to maintain T = D. Thus, both throttle (for thrust) and elevator (for trim at new angle of attack) must be changed. Options A or B alone are insufficient; rudder (D) is for directional control, not primary speed/trim adjustment in longitudinal flight."

          "Step 1: Understand the initial condition: airplane in steady, level flight, trimmed at a certain speed. This implies equilibrium: Lift (L) = Weight (W), Thrust (T) = Drag (D), and pitching moment coefficient $C_M = 0$.",
          "Step 2: Recall that for steady level flight, lift is given by $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. Since weight is constant, if speed V increases, the lift coefficient $C_L$ must decrease proportionally to $1/V^2$ to keep L = W.",
          "Step 3: To decrease $C_L$, the angle of attack (α) must be reduced. This requires a change in the aircraft's pitching moment equilibrium, achieved by deflecting the elevator. For example, a downward elevator deflection (positive δ_e) typically reduces angle of attack for a statically stable aircraft.",
          "Step 4: Additionally, drag D generally increases with speed (especially parasite drag). To maintain T = D at the higher speed, thrust must be increased by advancing the throttle.",
          "Step 5: Therefore, to transition to a new steady level flight at a higher speed, both elevator deflection (to re-trim at the new $C_L$ and α) and throttle adjustment (to provide adequate thrust) are necessary. Changing only one would not maintain all equilibrium conditions."
