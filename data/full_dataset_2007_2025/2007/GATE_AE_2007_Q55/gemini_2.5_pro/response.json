        "reasoning": "A stationary point of a multi-variable scalar function $f(x, y, z)$ is defined as a point where its partial derivatives with respect to all independent variables are zero. The gradient of a scalar function $f$ is given by $\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\mathbf{k}$. If all partial derivatives are zero, then $\\nabla f = 0\\mathbf{i} + 0\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the gradient of the function vanishes (becomes the zero vector) at a stationary point. Options A and C are incorrect because curl and divergence are operators applied to vector functions, not scalar functions (as implied by 'multi-variable function' in this context). Even if they were applicable, their vanishing or unity does not define a stationary point. Option D is incorrect because the gradient represents the direction of the maximum rate of change, and at a stationary point, the rate of change is zero, not maximum."

          "Step 2: Recall the definition of the gradient operator. The gradient of a scalar function $f(x, y, z)$ is a vector field that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of $f$, and its magnitude is the maximum rate of increase. It is mathematically expressed as $\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\mathbf{k}$.",
