        "reasoning": "The question asks for the boundary conditions of a rod fixed at the root (x=0) and free at the tip (x=l) for longitudinal vibration. \\n\\n1.  **Fixed end at x=0 (root):** A fixed end implies that there is no displacement at that point. Therefore, the displacement `u` at `x=0` must be zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as `u(x=0, t) = 0`. \\n2.  **Free end at x=l (tip):** A free end implies that there are no external forces acting on that end. In longitudinal vibration, the internal axial force (and thus stress) must be zero. The axial stress `$\\sigma$` in a rod is related to the displacement `u` by `$\\sigma = E (\\partial u / \\partial x)$`, where `E` is Young's modulus. If `$\\sigma = 0$`, then `$\\partial u / \\partial x$` must be zero at `x=l`. Mathematically, this is expressed as `$\\partial u / \\partial x (x=l, t) = 0$`. \\n\\nCombining these two conditions, the correct boundary conditions are `u(x=0)=0` and `$\\partial u / \\partial x(x=l)=0$`. This matches option A. This reasoning is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge, particularly Chunks 3, 4, 5, and 6, which explicitly state these conditions for a clamped-free rod."

          "Step 3: Identify the boundary condition for the free end at `x=l`. A free end means there is no external force acting on it. For longitudinal vibration, this translates to zero axial stress.",

          "Step 5: Apply the zero stress condition at the free end `x=l`. Since `$\\sigma(x=l, t) = 0$`, it implies `E (\\partial u / \\partial x)(x=l, t) = 0`. As `E` is non-zero for a vibrating rod, this simplifies to `$\\partial u / \\partial x (x=l, t) = 0$` (zero strain/slope of displacement).",
