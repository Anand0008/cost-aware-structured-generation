        "reasoning": "The primary function of a fuel injection system in any combustor (gas turbine or rocket) is to prepare the liquid fuel for efficient combustion. This is achieved by breaking down (atomizing) the bulk liquid fuel into a fine mist of tiny droplets. This process dramatically increases the fuel's surface area, enabling rapid vaporization and thorough mixing with the oxidizer (air), which is essential for complete and stable combustion. Option D directly describes atomization. Options A and B describe potential secondary effects or design goals of the overall combustor, not the primary purpose of the injection system. Option C (ignition) is the function of a separate ignition system (e.g., spark plugs)."

(B) Stagnation pressure typically decreases in a combustor due to losses (heat addition and drag); the injector does not increase it. (C) Ignition is performed by a separate system (e.g., spark igniter); the injector only delivers fuel."
