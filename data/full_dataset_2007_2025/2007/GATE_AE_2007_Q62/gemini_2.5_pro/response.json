Atomization is defined as the process of breaking down bulk liquid fuel into a fine mist of tiny droplets. This significantly increases the surface area of the fuel, facilitating rapid vaporization and thorough mixing with air, which are crucial for efficient and complete combustion. Options A, B, and C describe effects or separate components/processes, not the direct purpose of the fuel injection system itself. Accelerating flow (A) is not its primary role; increasing stagnation pressure (B) is incorrect as injectors cause pressure drops; and igniting the mixture (C) is done by an igniter, not the injector."
