        "reasoning": "For a satellite of mass m in a circular orbit of radius r around Earth (gravitational parameter \\(\\mu\\)), the specific mechanical energy is \\(\\varepsilon = -\\dfrac{\\mu}{2a}\\), where for a circular orbit the semi-major axis \\(a = r\\). Thus \\(\\varepsilon = -\\dfrac{\\mu}{2r}\\). A higher orbit (larger r) has a less negative specific energy, i.e., larger total mechanical energy E. Therefore, if \\(h_A > h_B\\), then \\(r_A > r_B\\) and \\(E_A > E_B\\).\nThe orbital speed in a circular orbit is \\(v = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\mu}{r}}\\). Hence the kinetic energy \\(T = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\tfrac{1}{2} m \\dfrac{\\mu}{r}\\). This decreases with increasing r. Therefore, \\(T_A < T_B\\) for \\(r_A > r_B\\). Combining these, the correct qualitative statement is \\(E_A > E_B\\) and \\(T_A < T_B\\), which corresponds to option D.\nRegarding potential energy V (gravitational), \\(V = -\\dfrac{\\mu m}{r}\\). A larger r makes V less negative (numerically larger). So \\(V_A > V_B\\). This is consistent with E = T + V: at higher orbit, T is smaller but V is larger, and the net E is larger (less negative). Option D matches the correct relations for E and T."

Overall, RAG aligned well with the orbital energy concepts needed here."
