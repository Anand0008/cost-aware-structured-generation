        "reasoning": "The question asks to compare the total mechanical energy (E), kinetic energy (T), and gravitational potential energy (V) of two identical satellites A and B in circular orbits at altitudes $h_A$ and $h_B$ respectively, with $h_A > h_B$. This implies that the orbital radius of satellite A, $r_A = R_e + h_A$, is greater than the orbital radius of satellite B, $r_B = R_e + h_B$, where $R_e$ is Earth's radius.\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the satellite and $\\mu = GM$ be the gravitational parameter of Earth.\n\n1.  **Gravitational Potential Energy (V):**\n    For a satellite at radius $r$, the gravitational potential energy is given by $V = -\\frac{\\mu m}{r}$.\n    Since $r_A > r_B$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{r_A} < \\frac{1}{r_B}$.\n    Multiplying by $-\\mu m$ (a negative quantity), the inequality reverses:\n    $-\\frac{\\mu m}{r_A} > -\\frac{\\mu m}{r_B}$\n    Therefore, $V_A > V_B$. (A higher orbit means less negative, hence greater potential energy).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Energy (T):**\n    For a satellite in a circular orbit at radius $r$, the orbital velocity is $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$.\n    The kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{r}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu m}{2r}$.\n    Since $r_A > r_B$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{r_A} < \\frac{1}{r_B}$.\n    Multiplying by $\\frac{\\mu m}{2}$ (a positive quantity), the inequality remains:\n    $\\frac{\\mu m}{2r_A} < \\frac{\\mu m}{2r_B}$\n    Therefore, $T_A < T_B$. (A higher orbit means lower orbital velocity, hence lower kinetic energy).\n\n3.  **Total Mechanical Energy (E):**\n    The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy: $E = T + V$.\n    $E = \\frac{\\mu m}{2r} - \\frac{\\mu m}{r} = -\\frac{\\mu m}{2r}$.\n    This can also be directly obtained from the specific orbital energy formula $e = -\\frac{\\mu}{2A}$ (where $A=r$ for circular orbits), so $E = m \\cdot e = -\\frac{\\mu m}{2r}$.\n    Since $r_A > r_B$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{r_A} < \\frac{1}{r_B}$.\n    Multiplying by $-\\frac{\\mu m}{2}$ (a negative quantity), the inequality reverses:\n    $-\\frac{\\mu m}{2r_A} > -\\frac{\\mu m}{2r_B}$\n    Therefore, $E_A > E_B$. (A higher orbit means less negative, hence greater total energy).\n\nCombining these results:\n*   $E_A > E_B$\n*   $T_A < T_B$\n*   $V_A > V_B$\n\nComparing with the given options:\n*   A. $E_A > E_B$ and $V_A < V_B$ (Incorrect, $V_A > V_B$)\n*   B. $E_A > E_B$ and $T_A > T_B$ (Incorrect, $T_A < T_B$)\n*   C. $E_A < E_B$ and $T_A > T_B$ (Incorrect, $E_A > E_B$ and $T_A < T_B$)\n*   D. $E_A > E_B$ and $T_A < T_B$ (Correct)"

          "name": "Vis-Viva Equation",
          "description": "The Vis-Viva equation directly relates orbital velocity, radial distance, and semi-major axis: $v^2 = \\mu \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)$. For circular orbits, $a=r$, so $v^2 = \\mu \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu}{r}$. This confirms the kinetic energy calculation. The total specific energy $e = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} = \\frac{\\mu}{2r} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} = -\\frac{\\mu}{2r}$. This approach is more general for any conic section but simplifies to the same for circular orbits.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: More general, useful for elliptical orbits. Cons: Slightly more complex if not already familiar with it, but provides a robust framework.",

Chunk 3 provided the circular velocity formula. Chunk 4 explained potential energy and conservation of total energy. Chunk 6 reinforced the concepts of potential and kinetic energy in orbit. The other chunks were less directly applicable but provided general context on orbital energy."
