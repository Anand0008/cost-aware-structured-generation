        "reasoning": "The question asks for the pressure loss factor of a combustor under very specific idealized assumptions: one-dimensional, incompressible, and frictionless flow in a constant area duct with heat addition. The pressure loss factor is defined as the stagnation pressure loss non-dimensionalized by the inlet dynamic pressure.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of the given assumptions:\n1.  **One-dimensional, steady flow in a constant area duct ($A = \\text{constant}$)**: This is the geometric setup.\n2.  **Incompressible flow ($\\rho = \\text{constant}$)**: This is a crucial assumption, meaning the density of the fluid does not change.\n3.  **Frictionless flow**: This means there are no viscous shear forces acting on the fluid, and thus no frictional pressure losses.\n\nFrom the principle of **mass conservation (continuity equation)** for steady, one-dimensional flow:\n$\\dot{m} = \\rho A V = \\text{constant}$\nSince the flow is incompressible ($\\rho = \\text{constant}$) and the duct area is constant ($A = \\text{constant}$), it implies that the velocity of the flow must also be constant throughout the combustor:\n$V_1 = V_2 = V = \\text{constant}$\n\nNow, consider the **momentum equation** for a constant area, frictionless flow with heat addition. In the absence of friction and external forces, the momentum equation simplifies to:\n$P_1 A + \\dot{m} V_1 = P_2 A + \\dot{m} V_2$\nDividing by area $A$ and substituting $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V$:\n$P_1 + \\rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \\rho V_2^2$\nSince we established that $V_1 = V_2$ (due to incompressible, constant area flow), the momentum equation further simplifies to:\n$P_1 = P_2$\nThis means the static pressure remains constant across the combustor under these specific assumptions.\n\nFinally, let's look at the **stagnation pressure** definition for incompressible flow:\n$P_0 = P + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$\nTherefore, the stagnation pressure at the inlet ($P_{01}$) and outlet ($P_{02}$) are:\n$P_{01} = P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2$\n$P_{02} = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$\nSince $P_1 = P_2$ and $V_1 = V_2$, it directly follows that:\n$P_{01} = P_{02}$\n\nThis means the stagnation pressure loss, $\\Delta P_0 = P_{01} - P_{02}$, is zero.\n\nThe pressure loss factor is defined as $\\frac{\\Delta P_0}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2}$. Since $\\Delta P_0 = 0$, the pressure loss factor is:\n$\\frac{0}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2} = 0$\n\nThe given stagnation temperatures ($540 \\text{ K}$ and $1104 \\text{ K}$) are consistent with heat addition, but under the \"incompressible and frictionless\" assumptions, this heat addition does not cause a stagnation pressure loss. This is a highly idealized scenario, contrasting with real combustors where significant stagnation pressure losses occur due to compressibility effects, friction, and flow acceleration."

        "notes": "The RAG chunks provided excellent context on real combustor pressure loss (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6) and Rayleigh flow (compressible, frictionless, heat addition - Chunks 2, 5). While highly relevant for understanding combustor analysis in general, they did not directly provide formulas or discussions for 'incompressible, frictionless flow with heat addition'. The solution required applying fundamental fluid mechanics principles (continuity, momentum) under the specific 'incompressible' assumption, which is a departure from the compressible flow focus of the RAG. The RAG was helpful for contrasting the idealized problem with real-world scenarios and typical GATE questions."

Assume that the flow is one dimensional, incompressible and frictionless and that the heat addition is driving the flow inside the combustor. The pressure loss factor (stagnation pressure loss non-dimensionalized by the inlet dynamic pressure) of the combustor is"
