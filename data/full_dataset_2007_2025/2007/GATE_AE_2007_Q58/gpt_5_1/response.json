        "reasoning": "The combustor is explicitly modeled as a one-dimensional, incompressible, frictionless, constant-area duct with heat addition driving the flow. For an incompressible fluid with no friction, the static pressure change along a constant-area duct is governed by Bernoulli: any increase in velocity must come from a drop in static pressure. However, the problem defines the pressure loss factor as the stagnation pressure loss non-dimensionalized by the inlet dynamic pressure. In incompressible, frictionless flow with only heat addition and no shaft work, the stagnation pressure remains constant because there is no irreversible process (no friction, no shocks, no area change). Thus, the stagnation pressure loss is zero, so the pressure loss factor is zero. The given large rise in stagnation temperature (from 540 K to 1104 K) is thermodynamically inconsistent with strict incompressible behavior, but the question instructs us to assume incompressible, frictionless flow; under those assumptions, total pressure cannot change, so the non-dimensional loss is zero. Therefore option A (0) matches the model implied by the assumptions and is consistent with the official key."

    "question_text": "A gas turbine engine operates with a constant area duct combustor with inlet and outlet stagnation temperatures 540 K and 1104 K respectively. Assume that the flow is one dimensional, incompressible and frictionless and that the heat addition is driving the flow inside the combustor. The pressure loss factor (stagnation pressure loss non-dimensionalized by the inlet dynamic pressure) of the combustor is"
