This is because the range of a glider is given by the equation R = h * (L/D), where h is the initial altitude. To achieve the maximum range, the glider should fly at the velocity corresponding to the maximum L/D ratio, which results in the shallowest descent angle and the longest glide distance. The other options, such as minimum rate of descent (B) or maximum descent angle (C), are not the conditions for maximum range, but rather for maximum endurance and minimum sink rate, respectively. The lift-to-weight ratio (D) is not the critical parameter for determining maximum range."
