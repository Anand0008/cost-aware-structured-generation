        "reasoning": "The fundamental principle for gliding flight is that the range is maximized when the glide angle (\\gamma) is minimized. From force balance, tan(\\gamma) = D/L = 1/(L/D). Therefore, the minimum glide angle occurs when the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is maximum. This is a standard result in flight mechanics, directly stated in the RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4). Option B (rate of descent minimum) corresponds to maximum endurance, not range (Chunk 6). Option C (descent angle maximum) is opposite to the condition for maximum range. Option D (lift to weight ratio maximum) is not the defining condition for maximum glide range; in a steady glide, L = W cos(\\gamma) ≈ W for small angles, so L/W ≈ 1, not a variable to maximize for range."
