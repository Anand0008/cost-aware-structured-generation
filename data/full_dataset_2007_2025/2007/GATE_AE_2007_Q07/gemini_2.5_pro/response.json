        "reasoning": "For a glider, maximum range is achieved when the aircraft covers the greatest horizontal distance for a given loss of altitude. This occurs at the shallowest possible glide angle ($\\\\gamma_{min}$). From the force balance equations for steady gliding flight (as detailed in RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4):\n1. Along the flight path: $D = W \\\\sin(\\\\gamma)$\n2. Perpendicular to the flight path: $L = W \\\\cos(\\\\gamma)$\nDividing these equations yields: $\\\\tan(\\\\gamma) = D/L = 1/(L/D)$.\nTo achieve the minimum glide angle ($\\\\gamma_{min}$), $\\\\tan(\\\\gamma)$ must be minimized. This implies that the ratio $D/L$ must be minimized, or equivalently, the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$) must be maximized. The range ($R$) covered during a glide from an altitude ($h$) is given by $R = h / \\\\tan(\\\\gamma) = h \\\\times (L/D)$. Therefore, maximum range ($R_{max}$) is achieved when the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$) is at its maximum value. This directly supports option A."

These are: $D = W \\\\sin(\\\\gamma)$ (along the flight path) and $L = W \\\\cos(\\\\gamma)$ (perpendicular to the flight path), where $D$ is drag, $L$ is lift, $W$ is weight, and $\\\\gamma$ is the glide angle.",

Dividing the two force balance equations gives $\\\\frac{L}{D} = \\\\frac{W \\\\cos(\\\\gamma)}{W \\\\sin(\\\\gamma)} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tan(\\\\gamma)}$.
