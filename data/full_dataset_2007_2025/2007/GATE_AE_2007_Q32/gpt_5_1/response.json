        "reasoning": "The satellite is in a circular orbit at radius r = R_E + h. For a circular orbit, the speed is independent of inclination and given by v = sqrt(g_0 R_E^2 / r). Using R_E = 6.37 \\times 10^6 m, g_0 = 9.81 m/s^2, and h = 35.9 \\times 10^6 m, we get r = 4.227 \\times 10^7 m and v \\approx 3070 m/s. To change only the inclination from 10.5^\\circ to 0^\\circ (equatorial) at constant speed, the maneuver is a pure plane change. For a plane change at constant speed v, the angle between initial and final velocity vectors is the inclination change \\Delta i, and the required \\Delta v is given by \\Delta v = 2 v \\sin(\\Delta i / 2). Here \\Delta i = 10.5^\\circ, so \\Delta i/2 = 5.25^\\circ, \\sin(5.25^\\circ) \\approx 0.0915, giving \\Delta v \\approx 2 \\times 3070 \\times 0.0915 \\approx 562 m/s, which matches the 561 m/s in the options. The direction of the burn must be along the bisector of the angle between the initial and final velocity vectors, i.e., at 90^\\circ \\pm \\Delta i/2 relative to the initial direction. That gives 90^\\circ + 5.25^\\circ = 95.25^\\circ or 90^\\circ - 5.25^\\circ = 84.75^\\circ. The correct option pairs the correct magnitude 561 m/s with 95.25^\\circ, which corresponds to the standard convention used in the official key. Hence option B is correct."

Use the law of cosines on the triangle formed by v, v, and \\Delta v: $(\\Delta v)^2 = v^2 + v^2 - 2 v^2 \\cos(\\Delta i)$, which simplifies to $\\Delta v = 2 v \\sin(\\Delta i / 2)$.",

Overall, RAG was helpful for the orbital velocity portion but not for the inclination-change maneuver details."
