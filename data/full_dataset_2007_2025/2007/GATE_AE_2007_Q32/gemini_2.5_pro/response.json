        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 2, 5 provided excellent context and formulas for calculating orbital velocity, including the relationship between $GM_E$ and $g_0R_E^2$. Chunks 3, 4, 6 helped confirm the nature of the orbit (geostationary) and its characteristics (0 degree inclination for equatorial). While the specific formula for plane change $\\Delta V$ and its angle was not explicitly stated in the RAG, the general concept of orbital maneuvers was covered, and the RAG provided strong foundational knowledge for the first part of the problem."
