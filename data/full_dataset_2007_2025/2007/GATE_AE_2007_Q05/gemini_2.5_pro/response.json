        "reasoning": "The question asks for the Euler iteration formula for numerically integrating a first-order nonlinear differential equation of the form $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ with a constant step size of $\\Delta t$. Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Given an ODE `dy/dt = f(y, t)` and an initial condition `y(t_0) = y_0`, the formula for Euler's method to approximate the next value `y_{i+1}` at `t_{i+1} = t_i + h` is `y_{i+1} = y_i + h * f(y_i, t_i)`. In this question, the dependent variable is `x` instead of `y`, the independent variable `t` is implicit in `f(x)` (meaning `f` depends only on `x`, not explicitly on `t`), and the step size is `\\Delta t` instead of `h`. Therefore, mapping these variables, the formula becomes `x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)`. This directly matches option D. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6) consistently provides this formula, confirming its correctness."

          "Step 2: Recall the general formula for Euler's explicit method. For an ordinary differential equation `dy/dt = f(y, t)` with a step size `h`, the iterative formula is given by `y_{i+1} = y_i + h \\times f(y_i, t_i)`.",
          "Step 3: Adapt the general formula to the given problem's notation. In the question, the dependent variable is `x` (instead of `y`), the independent variable is `t` (implied by $\\dot{x}$), the function is `f(x)` (meaning it depends only on `x`, not explicitly on `t`), and the step size is `\\Delta t` (instead of `h`). The index `k` is used for the current step, and `k+1` for the next step.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the given notation into the general Euler's formula. Replacing `y` with `x`, `i` with `k`, `i+1` with `k+1`, `h` with `\\Delta t`, and `f(y_i, t_i)` with `f(x_k)`, we get `x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)`.",
          "Step 5: Compare the derived formula with the given options. Option D, `x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)`, perfectly matches the derived formula."
