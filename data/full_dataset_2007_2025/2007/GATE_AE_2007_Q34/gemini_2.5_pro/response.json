For elevator setting $\\delta_e = 5$ degrees up, $C_m = 0.08$.\n   Conventionally, 'up' deflection means trailing edge up, which is a negative elevator deflection. So, $\\delta_{e1} = -5$ degrees.\n   $C_{m1} = 0.08$\n\n2. For elevator setting $\\delta_e = 5$ degrees down, $C_m = 0$.\n   'Down' deflection means trailing edge down, which is a positive elevator deflection.
