While they did not explicitly discuss composite beams, they provided the core relation M = EI/ρ and interpretation of EI as flexural rigidity, which directly supports deriving the composite expression by superposition."

The Young's modulus of material A and B are E_A and E_B, respectively. The sectional moment of area, about the neutral axis, of the cross-sectional areas made of materials A and B, are I_A and I_B, respectively. The radius of curvature ρ of the flexural deflection of this composite beam to the bending moment M is then"
