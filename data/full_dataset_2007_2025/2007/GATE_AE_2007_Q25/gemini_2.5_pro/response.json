The total bending moment $M$ is resisted by the sum of the moments carried by each material component. Each component contributes to the total flexural rigidity based on its own Young's modulus and moment of inertia about the common neutral axis.\n\nThus, the total bending moment $M$ can be expressed as:\n$M = M_A + M_B$\n\nWhere $M_A$ is the moment resisted by material A, and $M_B$ is the moment resisted by material B. Using the flexure formula for each material:\n$M_A = \\frac{E_A I_A}{\\rho}$\n$M_B = \\frac{E_B I_B}{\\rho}$\n\nSubstituting these into the total moment equation:\n$M = \\frac{E_A I_A}{\\rho} + \\frac{E_B I_B}{\\rho}$\n$M = \\frac{(E_A I_A + E_B I_B)}{\\rho}$\n\nRearranging to solve for the radius of curvature $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{(E_A I_A + E_B I_B)}{M}$\n\nThis matches option A."

So, $M_A = \\frac{E_A I_A}{\\rho}$ and $M_B = \\frac{E_B I_B}{\\rho}$.",

The Young's modulus of material A and B are E_A and E_B, respectively. The sectional moment of area, about the neutral axis, of the cross-sectional areas made of materials A and B, are I_A and I_B, respectively. The radius of curvature ρ of the flexural deflection of this composite beam to the bending moment M is then"
