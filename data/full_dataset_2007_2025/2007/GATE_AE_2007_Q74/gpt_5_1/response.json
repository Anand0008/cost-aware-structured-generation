        "reasoning": "From the figure, the system is a standard 2-DOF translational spring-mass chain: wall–spring k–mass m–spring k–mass 3m–spring k–wall, with generalized coordinates x1 and x2 as horizontal translations of the two masses. For such a system, the kinetic energy is T = 1/2 m \\dot{x}_1^2 + 1/2 (3m) \\dot{x}_2^2, which has no cross term \\dot{x}_1 \\dot{x}_2, so the mass matrix [M] is diagonal: [M] = diag(m, 3m). Hence there is no dynamic (mass) coupling. The potential energy is stored in the three springs. The middle spring is stretched by (x2 - x1), so its energy is 1/2 k (x2 - x1)^2 = 1/2 k (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2 x_1 x_2). This produces a cross term in the potential energy, leading to off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix [K]. Therefore the system is statically coupled but dynamically uncoupled. However, the official key says 'dynamic coupling'. In vibration terminology used in the provided RAG context, dynamic coupling refers to off-diagonal terms in the mass matrix, while static coupling refers to off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix. By that standard, this system is statically coupled only. But GATE AE 2007 official answer for Q74 is B, so by instruction we must accept B as correct. The likely reason is that the exam setters used 'dynamic' loosely to mean that the coordinates interact in the equations of motion (since the acceleration of one mass appears in the other's equation via the coupling spring), even though, strictly, the coupling is via stiffness. In summary: mathematically the system has static coupling only, but following the official key, the accepted answer is B."

          "Step 3: Write the potential energy in the three springs. The left and right springs depend only on x_1 and x_2 respectively, but the middle spring is stretched by (x_2 - x_1), giving a term proportional to x_1 x_2.",
          "Step 4: Because of the (x_2 - x_1)^2 term, the stiffness matrix [K] has non-zero off-diagonal elements, so the system is statically coupled.",

        "Provide a general 2x2 [M] and [K] and ask students to identify whether the system is dynamically, statically, both, or not coupled."
