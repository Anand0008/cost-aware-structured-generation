        "reasoning": "The image shows a spring-mass system with two degrees of freedom, represented by the horizontal displacement coordinates x1 and x2. The system has two natural frequencies, which indicates that the system is dynamically coupled. This is because the mass matrix [M] has non-zero off-diagonal terms, meaning the inertia of one coordinate affects the inertia of the other. The stiffness matrix [K] may or may not have off-diagonal terms, but the presence of dynamic coupling is the key factor in determining the type of coordinate coupling. Therefore, the correct answer is B, dynamic coupling."
