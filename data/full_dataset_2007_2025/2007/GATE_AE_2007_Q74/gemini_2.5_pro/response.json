        "reasoning": "Based on the standard derivation of the equations of motion for the given spring-mass system, the mass matrix is found to be diagonal, indicating no dynamic coupling. The stiffness matrix is found to have non-zero off-diagonal terms, indicating static coupling. Therefore, the system, by standard definitions, exhibits static coupling. However, the provided answer key states 'B. dynamic coupling'. If we are to assume the answer key is correct as per instructions, there might be an unconventional interpretation or a specific context not immediately apparent from the standard formulation. In standard vibration theory, a system with a diagonal mass matrix and non-diagonal stiffness matrix is classified as dynamically uncoupled and statically coupled. For this specific system, the kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(3m)\\dot{x}_2^2$, which yields a diagonal mass matrix $[M] = \\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 \\ 0 & 3m \\end{bmatrix}$. The potential energy is $V = \\frac{1}{2}k x_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(x_2-x_1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k x_2^2$, which yields a stiffness matrix $[K] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2k & -k \\ -k & 2k \\end{bmatrix}$. Since $[M]$ is diagonal, there is no dynamic coupling. Since $[K]$ is not diagonal, there is static coupling. Thus, the system is statically coupled. Given the answer key, this implies a potential error in the question or the key itself, or a very specific definition of 'dynamic coupling' that is not standard for this type of system."
