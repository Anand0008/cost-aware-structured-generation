        "reasoning": "The question asks for the lift curve slope of the *wing*, given the *airfoil* lift curve slope and wing geometry. This requires applying finite wing theory.\n\n1.  **Calculate Wing Aspect Ratio (AR):** For a rectangular wing, the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of span to chord. Given `span (b) = 1.2 m` and `chord (c) = 0.2 m`, the aspect ratio is:\n    `AR = b / c = 1.2 \\text{ m} / 0.2 \\text{ m} = 6`\n\n2.  **Convert Airfoil Lift Curve Slope (a₀) to Radians:** The finite wing theory formula typically requires the lift slope in radians. Given `a₀ = 0.1 \\text{ per degree}`, convert it:\n    `a_{0, \\text{rad}} = 0.1 \\times (\\frac{180}{\\pi}) \\approx 5.7296 \\text{ per radian}`\n\n3.  **Apply Finite Wing Theory Formula:** The lift curve slope of a finite wing (`a`) is related to the airfoil lift curve slope (`a₀`) and aspect ratio (`AR`) by Prandtl's Lifting Line Theory. In the absence of an Oswald efficiency factor (`e`) or taper ratio correction (`\\tau`), the most common approximation assumes an elliptical lift distribution (`e=1` or `\\tau=0`):\n    `a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + \\frac{a_0}{\\pi \\cdot AR}}`\n    Substituting the values (using `a₀` in radians):\n    `a_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{5.7296}{1 + \\frac{5.7296}{\\pi \\cdot 6}} = \\frac{5.7296}{1 + \\frac{5.7296}{18.8496}} = \\frac{5.7296}{1 + 0.30395} = \\frac{5.7296}{1.30395} \\approx 4.3940 \\text{ per radian}`\n\n4.  **Convert Wing Lift Curve Slope back to Degrees:** Since the options are in per degree, convert the calculated wing lift slope from per radian back to per degree:\n    `a_{\\text{deg}} = a_{\\text{rad}} \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{180}) = 4.3940 \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{180}) \\approx 0.07669 \\text{ per degree}`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `0.07669 \\text{ per degree}` is closest to option C, `0.075 \\text{ per degree}`. The slight difference may be due to rounding or the question implicitly assuming an Oswald efficiency factor `e \\approx 0.91` (which would yield exactly `0.075`). Given the options, `0.075` is the most appropriate choice. The other data provided (lift, velocity, density, angle of attack) is either for the next linked question or is inconsistent/distracting for this specific calculation of the wing's inherent lift curve slope."

          "**Step 1: Identify Given Parameters and Goal.** The problem provides the wing's chord (0.2 m), span (1.2 m), and the airfoil's lift curve slope (0.1 per degree). The goal is to find the lift curve slope of the *wing*. Note that the lift (35.3 N), freestream velocity (20 m/s), air density (1.225 kg/m³), and angle of attack (8 degrees) are extraneous for this specific question, as they would lead to an inconsistent wing lift slope if used directly.",
          "**Step 2: Calculate the Wing Aspect Ratio (AR).** For a rectangular wing, the aspect ratio is simply the ratio of its span to its chord. $\\text{AR} = \\frac{\\text{span}}{\\text{chord}} = \\frac{b}{c}$.",
          "**Step 3: Convert the Airfoil Lift Curve Slope (a₀) to Radians.** The standard formula for relating 2D (airfoil) and 3D (wing) lift slopes requires the 2D lift slope to be expressed in units of 'per radian'. The conversion factor is $1 \\text{ radian} = \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\text{ degrees}$.",
          "**Step 4: Apply the Finite Wing Theory Formula.** Use the formula derived from Prandtl's Lifting Line Theory to calculate the wing's lift curve slope ($a$). This formula accounts for the reduction in lift curve slope due to induced drag effects on a finite wing. In the absence of an Oswald efficiency factor ($e$) or taper ratio correction ($\\tau$), assume an elliptical lift distribution (i.e., $e=1$ or $\\tau=0$) for the simplest and most common approximation. The formula is $a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + \\frac{a_0}{\\pi \\cdot AR}}$, where $a_0$ is in radians.",
          "**Step 5: Convert the Wing Lift Curve Slope back to Degrees.** Since the options are provided in 'per degree', convert the calculated wing lift curve slope from 'per radian' back to 'per degree'.",
