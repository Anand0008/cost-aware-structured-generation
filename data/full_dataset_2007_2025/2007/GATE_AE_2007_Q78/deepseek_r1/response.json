For a symmetric airfoil in the linear range, the lift curve passes through (0,0). Using the given data: Lift L = 35.3 N, air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m³, velocity V = 20 m/s, wing area S = chord * span = 0.2 m * 1.2 m = 0.24 m², angle of attack α = 8°. First, compute the lift coefficient: C_L = L / (0.5 * ρ * V² * S). Substituting yields C_L ≈ 0.6003. Then a_wing = C_L / α ≈ 0.6003 / 8 = 0.07504 per degree. This matches option C (0.075 per deg). The airfoil lift slope (0.1 per deg) is a distractor; the finite wing's slope is lower due to downwash effects."
