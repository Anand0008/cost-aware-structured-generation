        "reasoning": "Euler's critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$) for a slender column is fundamentally dependent on its end boundary conditions. The general formula is $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(KL)^2}$, where $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the minimum area moment of inertia, $L$ is the actual length, and $K$ is the effective length factor, which accounts for the end conditions.\n\nLet's match each boundary condition from Column X to its corresponding critical buckling load in Column Y:\n\n*   **X1. Pinned-pinned column:** For a pinned-pinned column, the effective length factor $K=1$. Substituting this into the general formula gives $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(1L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{L^2}$. This matches **Y4**.\n\n*   **X2. Fixed-free (cantilevered) column:** For a fixed-free column, the effective length factor $K=2$. Substituting this gives $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(2L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{4L^2}$. This matches **Y3**.\n\n*   **X3.

Substituting this gives $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(0.5L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(L/2)^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2EI}{L^2}$. This matches **Y1**.\n\n*   **X4. Fixed-pinned column:** For a fixed-pinned column, the effective length factor $K \\approx 0.7$ (more precisely, $K = 1/\\sqrt{2.046} \\approx 0.699$). Substituting this gives $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{(0.7L)^2} \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2EI}{0.49L^2} \\approx 2.04\\frac{\\pi^2EI}{L^2}$. The given option **Y2** is $P_{cr} = 2.046\\pi^2EI / L^2$, which is the precise value for this case.\n\nCombining these matches:\n*   X1-Y4\n*   X2-Y3\n*   X3-Y1\n*   X4-Y2\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to Option A."
