        "reasoning": "The question asks for the highest limit load factor for a civil transport aircraft. According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 4), 'Limit Load' is the highest load an aircraft is expected to encounter during normal operations. Chunk 1 mentions a 'standard 2.5g manoeuvre limit' for civil aircraft and notes that for cruise speeds, gust cases can exceed this. Chunk 2 provides a specific example for a 'normal category aircraft' (which includes civil transport aircraft) where the maneuver load factor `n1` is approximately 3.8 for a 14,000 lb aircraft. Both 2.5g and 3.8g fall within the range of 2.0 – 5.0. Therefore, option B is the correct range."

          "Step 2: Recall typical load factor values for civil transport aircraft. Airworthiness authorities specify these values (Chunk 2). For normal category aircraft, which includes civil transport aircraft, the positive limit maneuver load factor ($n_1$) is typically around 2.5g to 3.8g (Chunk 1, Chunk 2).",
          "Step 3: Compare these typical values with the given options. A standard civil aircraft might have a positive limit load factor of +2.5g (Chunk 1) or approximately +3.8g for a 14,000 lb aircraft (Chunk 2).",
          "Step 4: Determine which range encompasses these values. Both 2.5g and 3.8g fall squarely within the range of 2.0 – 5.0. Therefore, this range represents the highest limit load factor for civil transport aircraft."
