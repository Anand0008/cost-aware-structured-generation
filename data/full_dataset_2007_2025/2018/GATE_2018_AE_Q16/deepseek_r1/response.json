The positive limit load factor (n1) is typically 2.5 for heavier aircraft and can be slightly higher for smaller transport aircraft, but rarely exceeds 4.0. The negative limit load factor is around -1.0. Therefore, the highest (positive) limit load factor falls within 2.0 to 5.0. Options A (0-2) is too low, C (5-8) is typical for aerobatic or military aircraft, and D (8-10) is for high-performance fighters."
