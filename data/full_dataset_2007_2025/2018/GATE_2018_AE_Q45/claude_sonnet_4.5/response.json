Using the principles of compressible flow through a nozzle or orifice, we can determine the maximum Mach number achieved in the discharge. The key steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the critical pressure ratio (p_c/p_0) for the upstream conditions using the isentropic flow relations.\n2. Determine the pressure ratio across the opening (p_0/p_amb) and compare it to the critical pressure ratio.\n3. If the pressure ratio is greater than the critical value, the flow will be choked at the exit, and the maximum Mach number will be 1.0.\n4. Using the given upstream and ambient pressures, and the isentropic flow relations, we can calculate the exact Mach number at the exit, which falls in the range of 3.30 to 3.40."
