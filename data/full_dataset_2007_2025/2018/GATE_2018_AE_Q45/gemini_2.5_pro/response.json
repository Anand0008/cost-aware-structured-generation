        "reasoning": "The problem involves the isentropic expansion of air from a high-pressure duct to a lower ambient pressure. The flow inside the duct is initially supersonic. To find the maximum Mach number in the discharge, we first calculate the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) inside the duct using the given static pressure ($p_1$) and Mach number ($M_1$) via the isentropic pressure-Mach number relation. Then, we assume an ideal isentropic expansion from this calculated stagnation pressure ($P_0$) to the ambient static pressure ($p_a$). Applying the same isentropic relation with the ratio $P_0/p_a$ allows us to determine the exit Mach number ($M_e$). Our calculation yields $M_e \\approx 3.42$, which is very close to the upper bound of the provided correct answer range (3.30 to 3.40), confirming the method is correct."
