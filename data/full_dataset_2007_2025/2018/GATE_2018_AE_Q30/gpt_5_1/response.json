This result can be derived from slope-deflection or conjugate-beam/compatibility methods. Using symmetry, each end moment is equal (M) and the vertical reactions are equal (R). Taking moments about one end gives R = P/2. The bending moment at a distance x from the left end (0 \\le x \\le L/2) is M(x) = M + R x. The rotation at each fixed end must be zero. Integrating the curvature equation EI \\theta(x) = \\int M(x) dx and enforcing \\theta(0) = 0 and \\theta(L) = 0 yields M = PL/8. This matches the standard structural tables and option C."

Core solution relied on standard beam theory and internal knowledge, while RAG helped reinforce general SFD/BMD and beam analysis concepts."
