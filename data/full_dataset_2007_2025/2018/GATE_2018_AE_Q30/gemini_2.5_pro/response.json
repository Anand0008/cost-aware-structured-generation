To find the moment reaction at the fixed ends, one can use the double integration method or recall the standard formula for this specific beam configuration.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactions:** Due to the symmetry of the beam and loading, the vertical reactions at both fixed ends (let's call them $R_A$ and $R_B$) are equal: $R_A = R_B = P/2$. Similarly, the moment reactions at both ends ($M_A$ and $M_B$) are equal in magnitude.\n\n2.  **Bending Moment Equation:** Consider a section of the beam from the left end ($x=0$) to the midspan ($x=L/2$). The bending moment $M(x)$ in this section, considering the unknown moment reaction $M_A$ (assumed positive counter-clockwise) and vertical reaction $R_A = P/2$ (upwards), is:\n    $M(x) = M_A + (P/2)x$\n\n3.  **Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation:**\n    $EI \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = M(x) = M_A + \\frac{P}{2}x$\n\n4.  **Integrate for Slope:**\n    $EI \\frac{dy}{dx} = M_A x + \\frac{P}{4}x^2 + C_1$\n\n5.  **Integrate for Deflection:**\n    $EI y(x) = \\frac{M_A}{2}x^2 + \\frac{P}{12}x^3 + C_1 x + C_2$\n\n6.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   At the clamped end $x=0$: Deflection $y(0)=0$ and slope $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0$.\n        From $y(0)=0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n        From $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0 \\implies C_1 = 0$.\n\n    The slope and deflection equations simplify to:\n    $EI \\frac{dy}{dx} = M_A x + \\frac{P}{4}x^2$\n    $EI y(x) = \\frac{M_A}{2}x^2 + \\frac{P}{12}x^3$\n\n7.  **Apply Symmetry Condition:** Due to the symmetric loading and supports, the slope at the midspan ($x=L/2$) must be zero:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx}(L/2) = 0$\n\n8.  **Solve for $M_A$:** Substitute $x=L/2$ into the simplified slope equation:\n    $0 = M_A (L/2) + \\frac{P}{4} (L/2)^2$\n    $0 = M_A \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{P}{4} \\frac{L^2}{4}$\n    $0 = M_A \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{PL^2}{16}$\n    $M_A \\frac{L}{2} = -\\frac{PL^2}{16}$\n    $M_A = -\\frac{PL^2}{16} \\times \\frac{2}{L} = -\\frac{PL}{8}$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the moment reaction is a hogging moment (i.e., it acts in the opposite direction to the assumed positive moment, which is consistent with the beam bending downwards).

          "**Step 2: Determine Support Reactions (Vertical).** Due to the symmetry of the beam and the loading, the vertical reactions at both fixed ends are equal. By summing vertical forces, $R_A + R_B = P$, so $R_A = R_B = P/2$. Also, due to symmetry, the moment reactions at both ends ($M_A$ and $M_B$) will be equal in magnitude.",
          "**Step 3: Establish the Bending Moment Equation.** Consider a section of the beam from the left end ($x=0$) up to the midspan ($x=L/2$). The bending moment $M(x)$ at any point $x$ in this section is given by the sum of moments from the reactions at the left end. Assuming $M_A$ is a counter-clockwise moment and $R_A$ is an upward force, $M(x) = M_A + R_A x = M_A + (P/2)x$.",

          "**Step 5: Integrate to Find Slope and Deflection Equations.** Integrate the equation once to get the slope $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and a second time to get the deflection $y(x)$, introducing integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.",
          "**Step 6: Apply Boundary Conditions at the Clamped End.** For a clamped (fixed) end at $x=0$, both the deflection and the slope are zero: $y(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0$. Use these conditions to solve for $C_1$ and $C_2$. You will find $C_1=0$ and $C_2=0$.",

However, it did not provide the specific formula or derivation for a clamped-clamped beam with a midspan point load, requiring reliance on internal knowledge for the exact solution. Other RAG chunks were less relevant, focusing on simply supported beams or beam-columns."
