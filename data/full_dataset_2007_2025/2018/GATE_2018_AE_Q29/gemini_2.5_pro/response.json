The maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) occurs at the outer surface.\n\n2.  **Calculate maximum shear stress:** The formula for maximum shear stress in a solid circular shaft of diameter 'd' subjected to a torque 'T' is given by the torsion formula (as per RAG chunks 1, 2, 6):\n    `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d^3}$`\n\n3.  **Determine principal stresses from pure shear:** For a state of pure shear, where `$\\sigma_x = 0$`, `$\\sigma_y = 0$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{max}$`, the principal stresses (maximum normal stresses) can be found using Mohr's Circle or the principal stress formulas. \n    *   The center of Mohr's Circle `C = (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) / 2 = (0 + 0) / 2 = 0$`. \n    *   The radius of Mohr's Circle `R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{0 - 0}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{max}^2} = \\tau_{max}$`.\n    *   The principal stresses are `$\\sigma_1 = C + R = 0 + \\tau_{max} = \\tau_{max}$` (maximum tensile stress) and `$\\sigma_2 = C - R = 0 - \\tau_{max} = -\\tau_{max}$` (maximum compressive stress). (This is explicitly stated in RAG chunk 5).\n\n4.  **Substitute `$\\tau_{max}$`:** Therefore, the maximum tensile stress experienced at any point on the shaft is equal to the maximum shear stress:\n    `$\\sigma_{tensile, max} = \\tau_{max} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d^3}$`\n\nThis matches option D."

Specifically, `$\\sigma_1 = +\\tau_{xy}$` (tensile) and `$\\sigma_2 = -\\tau_{xy}$` (compressive). This can be visualized using Mohr's Circle, where the center is at the origin and the radius is `$\\tau_{xy}$`.",
