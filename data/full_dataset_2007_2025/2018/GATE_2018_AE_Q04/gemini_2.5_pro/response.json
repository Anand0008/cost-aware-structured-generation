        "reasoning": "The aircraft is initially flying at its maximum endurance condition, which, for a jet aircraft, occurs at the velocity where the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$) is maximized. This also corresponds to the minimum thrust required ($T_R$) for steady, level flight (RAG Chunk 1, 3, 6).\n\n1.  **To fly faster (increase $V$)**: The question states the aircraft needs to fly 'faster' at the 'same altitude'.\n2.  **Maintain steady, level flight**: For steady, level flight, Lift ($L$) must equal Weight ($W$), and Thrust ($T$) must equal Drag ($D$) (RAG Chunk 2, 4, 5, 6).\n3.  **Effect on Angle of Attack ($\\alpha$)**: The lift equation is $L = 0.5 \\rho V^2 S_w C_L$. Since $L=W$ (constant) and $\\rho$, $S_w$ are constant (same altitude), if the airspeed $V$ increases, the dynamic pressure term ($0.5 \\rho V^2 S_w$) increases. To maintain $L=W$, the coefficient of lift ($C_L$) must decrease. Since $C_L$ is primarily a function of angle of attack ($\\alpha$), a decrease in $C_L$ requires a decrease in $\\alpha$ (RAG Chunk 2, 5, 6). The pilot achieves this by pushing the control stick forward, which reduces the angle of attack.\n4.  **Effect on Thrust**: The thrust required for steady, level flight is $T_R = D = W / (L/D)$ (RAG Chunk 6). At maximum endurance, the aircraft is flying at the minimum $T_R$ (maximum $L/D$). If the aircraft flies faster than this speed, it moves away from the minimum $T_R$ point on the thrust-required curve. Generally, for speeds higher than the maximum endurance speed, the drag (and thus the thrust required) increases. Therefore, to maintain steady flight at a higher speed, the pilot must increase thrust to overcome the increased drag.\n\nCombining these two points, the pilot should increase thrust and reduce the angle of attack. This corresponds to option C."

          "Step 3: Analyze the lift requirement for steady, level flight. For constant altitude, lift ($L$) must equal weight ($W$). The lift equation is $L = 0.5 \\rho V^2 S_w C_L$. Since $L$, $\\rho$, and $S_w$ are constant, if the airspeed ($V$) increases, the coefficient of lift ($C_L$) must decrease to maintain the balance $L=W$.",
          "Step 4: Determine the change in angle of attack ($\\alpha$). The coefficient of lift ($C_L$) is directly related to the angle of attack ($\\alpha$) for a given airfoil. To decrease $C_L$, the angle of attack ($\\alpha$) must be reduced.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the thrust requirement. At maximum endurance, the aircraft is flying at the speed of minimum thrust required ($T_R$). As the aircraft flies faster than this speed, the total drag ($D$) increases. To maintain steady flight (where thrust $T$ equals drag $D$), the pilot must increase thrust.",
