        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. To fly steady and level but faster at the same altitude, the pilot must increase thrust and reduce the angle of attack.\n\nIncreasing thrust alone (option A) would cause the aircraft to accelerate, but it would also increase the lift, causing the aircraft to climb. \n\nIncreasing both thrust and angle of attack (option B) would also cause the aircraft to climb, as the increased angle of attack would generate more lift.\n\nReducing the angle of attack alone (option D) would cause the aircraft to descend, as the reduced lift would no longer balance the weight.\n\nBy increasing thrust and reducing the angle of attack (option C), the pilot can maintain level flight at a higher airspeed. The reduced angle of attack compensates for the increased dynamic pressure, keeping the lift equal to the weight."
