        "reasoning": "At maximum endurance for a jet, the aircraft flies at the speed corresponding to maximum lift-to-drag ratio or near-minimum thrust required, which occurs at a relatively high coefficient of lift and angle of attack for that weight and altitude. In steady, level flight, lift must equal weight: $L = W = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. If the aircraft is to fly faster at the same altitude and weight, $V$ increases while $\\rho$ and $S$ are constant. To keep $L=W$ with a higher $V$, the required $C_L$ must decrease. Since $C_L$ increases with angle of attack $\\alpha$ in the linear range, a lower $C_L$ means a lower $\\alpha$. So the pilot must reduce angle of attack. At the same time, drag at the higher speed is larger, so to maintain steady level flight, thrust must be increased to balance the higher drag ($T=D$). Therefore, the correct combined action is: increase thrust and reduce angle of attack, which is option C."

          "Step 4: In the linear lift range, $C_L$ is approximately proportional to angle of attack $\\alpha$ ($C_L = C_{L0} + a \\alpha$). Therefore, a decrease in $C_L$ requires a decrease in $\\alpha$.",
          "Step 5: Consider drag and thrust: at higher speed, profile drag increases and induced drag changes; overall drag $D$ at the new, higher speed is larger than at the endurance condition. To maintain steady, level flight, thrust must be increased so that $T = D$ at the new speed.",
          "Step 6: Combine both requirements: to fly faster at the same altitude and still be steady and level, the pilot must increase thrust (to balance higher drag) and reduce angle of attack (to keep lift equal to weight at higher dynamic pressure). This matches option C."
