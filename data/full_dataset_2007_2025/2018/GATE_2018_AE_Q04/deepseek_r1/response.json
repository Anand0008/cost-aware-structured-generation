        "reasoning": "For a jet aircraft in steady, level flight, maximum endurance occurs at the velocity where the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is maximized. At this condition, thrust required is minimized. To fly faster at the same altitude while maintaining level flight (L = W), the aircraft must operate at a lower lift coefficient (C_L) because dynamic pressure increases with speed. A lower C_L is achieved by reducing the angle of attack. Simultaneously, flying faster than the speed for maximum L/D moves the aircraft to a higher point on the thrust-required curve, meaning drag (and thus required thrust) increases. Therefore, the pilot must increase thrust to overcome the higher drag and reduce angle of attack to adjust the lift coefficient for the new speed."

          "Step 3: Understand the relationship between speed ($V$), lift coefficient ($C_L$), and angle of attack ($\\alpha$). From $L=W$, for constant weight and altitude, $C_L \\propto 1/V^2$. To fly faster, $C_L$ must decrease. $C_L$ is primarily a function of $\\alpha$ (in linear range), so decreasing $C_L$ requires reducing $\\alpha$.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the drag (thrust required) implications. The thrust-required curve has a minimum at the velocity for maximum L/D. Flying faster than this velocity increases the required thrust. Therefore, to maintain level flight at a higher speed, thrust must be increased to match the higher drag.",
          "Step 5: Combine the required actions. To fly steady, level, and faster at the same altitude from the maximum endurance condition, the pilot must (1) increase thrust to overcome increased drag, and (2) reduce angle of attack to achieve the lower $C_L$ needed for the higher speed."
