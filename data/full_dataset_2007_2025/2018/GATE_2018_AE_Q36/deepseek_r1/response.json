For any simple, closed contour that encloses the origin, the circulation (closed line integral $\\oint \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$) is a constant $2\\pi$. Evaluating $2\\pi$ gives approximately 6.2832, which rounds to 6.28 (within the specified range of 6.25-6.35). This is a well-known result, independent of the contour's shape, due to the singular behavior at the origin where the curl (circulation density) is a Dirac delta function. The RAG context confirms Stokes' theorem and the notation for closed integrals, providing the foundational principles."

We need to compute the closed line integral $\\oint \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$, which is the circulation of $\\mathbf{v}$ around a contour enclosing the origin.",
          "Step 2: Identify the physical and mathematical nature of the field. This is the velocity field of a line vortex (or potential vortex) centered at the origin. For such a vortex, the tangential velocity is proportional to $1/r$. A key property is that the circulation $\\Gamma$ is constant for any closed loop encircling the origin.",
          "Step 3: Choose a convenient contour for evaluation. Since the circulation is path-independent for contours enclosing the origin (the field is irrotational everywhere except at the origin), we can choose a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin. This simplifies the calculation due to symmetry.",

The differential tangent vector is $d\\mathbf{s} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{d\\theta} d\\theta = (-R\\sin \\theta \\, d\\theta) \\hat{i} + (R\\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta) \\hat{j}$.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the vector field on the contour. Substitute $x$ and $y$ into $\\mathbf{v}$: $\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{R\\sin \\theta}{R^2} \\hat{i} + \\frac{R\\cos \\theta}{R^2} \\hat{j} = -\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{R} \\hat{i} + \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{R} \\hat{j}$.",

The RAG context on double integrals in polar coordinates (Chunks 2, 6) and complex analysis (Chunks 3, 4) was not directly applicable."
