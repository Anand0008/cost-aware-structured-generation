The vector field v can be written in polar coordinates as v = -sin(θ)/r i + cos(θ)/r j.\n2. The contour integral of v.ds around a closed contour C that encloses the origin is given by the formula:\n   ∮_C v.ds = ∮_C (-sin(θ)/r dr + cos(θ)/r dθ)\n3. Since the contour encloses the origin, the radial component (dr) vanishes, and the integral simplifies to:\n   ∮_C v.ds = ∮_C cos(θ)/r dθ\n4. Evaluating the integral, we get:\n   ∮_C v.ds = ∫_0^2π cos(θ)/r dθ = ∫_0^2π cos(θ) dθ = 2π\nTherefore, the contour integral of the given vector field around a contour that encloses the origin is 2π, which is between 6.25 and 6.35 when rounded to two decimal places."
