          "Step 2: Recognize that the vector field has a singularity at the origin $(0,0)$ (where $r=0$), and the contour $C$ encloses this origin. This is a critical observation, as it means Green's Theorem cannot be directly applied to the entire region enclosed by $C$ because the field is not continuously differentiable at the origin.",
          "Step 3: Choose a convenient contour that encloses the origin. The simplest choice is a circle of arbitrary radius $R$ centered at the origin. Parameterize this contour in polar coordinates: $x = R\\cos\\theta$, $y = R\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$ for a full closed loop.",

The vector field represents an ideal point vortex, a key component in modeling complex flow patterns around aerodynamic bodies.",

The vector field $\\mathbf{v}$ is related to the imaginary part of $\\frac{1}{z}$. This connection highlights the deep mathematical parallels between real vector calculus and complex analysis, especially concerning singularities.",
