A mathematical proof exists, but for the given discrete set (circle, square, equilateral triangle), one can compute the area for each shape given the same perimeter P and compare. Let P be the common perimeter. For a circle, radius r = P/(2π), area = πr² = P²/(4π) ≈ 0.0796 P². For a square, side a = P/4, area = a² = P²/16 = 0.0625 P². For an equilateral triangle, side s = P/3, area = (√3/4) s² = (√3/36) P² ≈ 0.0481 P². Clearly, circle area > square area > triangle area."
