        "notes": "RAG context was highly relevant. Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 all pertained to isentropic flow, Bernoulli equation derivations, and related formulas. Chunk 1 specifically derived the critical pressure ratio, which is a related concept. Chunks 2, 4, and 6 provided the exact Bernoulli equation for isentropic flow needed to answer the question. Chunk 5 provided the isentropic relations in Mach number form, which is an alternative viewpoint. The context was sufficient to confirm the correct answer and provide supporting material for the explanation."
