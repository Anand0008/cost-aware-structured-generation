This expression is derived from the Bernoulli's equation for isentropic flow, which relates the change in kinetic energy to the change in pressure between two points in a steady, isentropic flow. The key steps are:\n1. Start with the integral form of Bernoulli's equation: $V^2/2 + \\int dp/\rho = constant$\n2. Substitute the isentropic relation $p/\rho^\\gamma = constant$ to express $\rho$ in terms of $p$\n3.
