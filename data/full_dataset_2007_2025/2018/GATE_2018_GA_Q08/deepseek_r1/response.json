Remaining work = 47775 - 34125 = 13650 robot-hours. Remaining time = 13 days. With new hours (8 hours/day), let n be additional robots. Then (125 + n) × 8 × 13 = 13650, solving gives n = 6.25 ≈ 7. However, 7 is not among options (50, 89, 146, 175). The answer key states 'Marks to All,' indicating all candidates were awarded marks likely due to this discrepancy.
