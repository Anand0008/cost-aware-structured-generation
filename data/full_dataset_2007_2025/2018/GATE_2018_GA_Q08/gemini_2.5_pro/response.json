        "reasoning": "The problem is a classic 'work and time' problem. The amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of robots, the number of days they work, and the hours per day they are operational. We can establish a relationship between these quantities.\n\nLet $W$ be the total work to be completed. Let $R$ be the number of robots, $D$ be the number of days, and $H$ be the hours per day. The work done can be expressed as $Work = k \\times R \\times D \\times H$, where $k$ is a constant representing the work rate per robot-hour.\n\n**Phase 1: Work completed**\n*   Initial robots ($R_1$) = 125\n*   Days worked ($D_1$) = 39 days\n*   Hours per day ($H_1$) = 7 hours\n*   Work completed ($W_1$) = $\\frac{5}{7}$ of total work ($W$)\n\nSo, $\\frac{5}{7} W = k \\times 125 \\times 39 \\times 7$ (Equation 1)\n\n**Phase 2: Remaining work**\n*   Remaining days ($D_2$) = Total days - Days worked = $52 - 39 = 13$ days\n*   New hours per day ($H_2$) = 8 hours\n*   Remaining work ($W_2$) = $W - \\frac{5}{7} W = \\frac{2}{7} W$\n*   Let $R_2$ be the total number of robots required for the remaining work.\n\nSo, $\\frac{2}{7} W = k \\times R_2 \\times 13 \\times 8$ (Equation 2)\n\nTo find $R_2$, we can divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n\n$\\frac{(\\frac{2}{7} W)}{(\\frac{5}{7} W)} = \\frac{(k \\times R_2 \\times 13 \\times 8)}{(k \\times 125 \\times 39 \\times 7)}$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{R_2 \\times 13 \\times 8}{125 \\times 39 \\times 7}$\n\nNow, solve for $R_2$:\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{125 \\times 39 \\times 7}{13 \\times 8}$\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{2 \\times 125 \\times 39 \\times 7}{5 \\times 13 \\times 8}$\n\nPerform cancellations:\n*   $125 / 5 = 25$\n*   $39 / 13 = 3$\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{2 \\times 25 \\times 3 \\times 7}{8}$\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{25 \\times 3 \\times 7}{4}$ (after cancelling a 2 from numerator and denominator)\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{525}{4}$\n\n$R_2 = 131.25$\n\nThis is the total number of robots required for the remaining work. The question asks for 'additional robots'.\n\nAdditional robots = $R_2 - R_1 = 131.25 - 125 = 6.25$\n\nSince the number of robots must be an integer, 7 additional robots would be required to ensure completion on time (rounding up). However, 6.25 is the precise calculated value. None of the options (A. 50, B. 89, C. 146, D. 175) match this calculated value or a reasonable rounded integer (6 or 7). The 'Marks to All' status for this question in the GATE exam confirms a discrepancy with the provided options."
