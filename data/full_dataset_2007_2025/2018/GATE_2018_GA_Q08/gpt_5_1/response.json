        "reasoning": "Treat total work as proportional to robot-hours. Initially: 125 robots, 7 h/day, 52 days. Total planned robot-hours: 125 \\times 7 \\times 52 = 45500 robot-hours. After 39 days, work done is \\frac{5}{7} of total, so remaining work is \\frac{2}{7} of total. Work completed in 39 days: 125 \\times 7 \\times 39 = 34125 robot-hours. This should equal \\frac{5}{7} of total work W. Let W be in robot-hours at 7 h/day baseline. From proportion: \\frac{5}{7}W = 34125 \\Rightarrow W = 34125 \\times \\frac{7}{5} = 47775 robot-hours. Then remaining work = W - 34125 = 13650 robot-hours. Remaining time: 52 - 39 = 13 days, with each robot now working 8 h/day. If R is the total number of robots in the remaining period, total remaining capacity = R \\times 8 \\times 13 = 104R robot-hours. Set equal to remaining work: 104R = 13650 \\Rightarrow R = 131.25 robots. Initially there are 125 robots, so additional robots required = 131.25 - 125 = 6.25. Since number of robots must be an integer, the minimal feasible integer is 7, but none of the options (50, 89, 146, 175) match 6, 7, or any reasonable rounding. Alternative interpretations (e.g., assuming total work fixed by initial plan: 45500 robot-hours) also lead to non-integer or non-option answers. Hence the official key awarded marks to all, indicating the options are inconsistent with any sensible interpretation. Therefore, 'Marks to All' is correct as per official GATE decision."

          "Step 1: Define work in terms of robot-hours. One robot working 1 hour does 1 unit of work. Total planned work if plan was followed: 125 robots \\times 7 h/day \\times 52 days = 45500 robot-hours.",
          "Step 2: Compute work actually done in 39 days: 125 robots \\times 7 h/day \\times 39 days = 34125 robot-hours. This is given to be \\frac{5}{7} of total work W.",
          "Step 3: Use proportion to find total work W: \\frac{5}{7}W = 34125 \\Rightarrow W = 34125 \\times \\frac{7}{5} = 47775 robot-hours. Then remaining work = W - 34125 = 13650 robot-hours.",
          "Step 4: Remaining time is 52 - 39 = 13 days. Now each robot works 8 h/day. Let R be the total number of robots in this remaining period. Available work capacity = R \\times 8 \\times 13 = 104R robot-hours.",
          "Step 5: Equate remaining work to remaining capacity: 104R = 13650 \\Rightarrow R = 131.25 robots. Additional robots required = R - 125 = 6.25, which is not an integer and does not match any option.",
          "Step 6: Check alternative interpretation (keeping total work as 45500 robot-hours). Then remaining work = 45500 - 34125 = 11375 robot-hours. With 13 days and 8 h/day, if N is additional robots, total robots = 125 + N, so (125 + N) \\times 8 \\times 13 = 11375 \\Rightarrow 104(125 + N) = 11375 \\Rightarrow N \\approx -16.7, meaning fewer robots would be needed, again not matching options.",
          "Step 7: Since all reasonable interpretations fail to yield any of the given options, the question is flawed. The official GATE key therefore awarded full marks to all candidates, which is why 'Marks to All' is the official outcome."
