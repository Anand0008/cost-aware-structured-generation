The key factor is that the thrust is directly proportional to the free-stream density, as per the formula $T = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 S C_T$. On hot summer days, the air density $\\rho$ decreases, leading to a reduction in thrust. This results in a lower net accelerating force, requiring a longer ground roll distance to reach the necessary takeoff speed. The other options are not the primary reason for the increased ground roll distance on hot days."
