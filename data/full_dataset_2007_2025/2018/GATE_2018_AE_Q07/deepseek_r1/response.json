        "reasoning": "On hot summer days, air temperature is higher, leading to lower air density ($\\rho$). For most aircraft propulsion systems (jet engines and propellers), thrust ($T$) is approximately directly proportional to free-stream density. Lower density means lower thrust produced by the engine for a given throttle setting. Reduced thrust ($T$) decreases the net accelerating force ($T - D - F_{friction}$), leading to lower acceleration ($a$). To achieve the same lift-off speed ($V_{LO}$), the aircraft requires more time and a longer distance ($s$) to accelerate, as given by kinematics ($s \\propto V^2 / a$). Option B is false; thrust depends on engine design and atmospheric conditions, not directly on aircraft weight. Option C is false; the lift-off distance formula shows it is inversely proportional to density, not directly proportional (see Chunk 3). Option D is false; while runway surface temperature might affect friction slightly, the dominant effect is the aerodynamic and propulsive impact of low density."

          "Step 3: Establish the dependency of thrust on density. For gas turbine (jet) engines and propellers, thrust at a given velocity is approximately directly proportional to air density: $T \\propto \\rho$. Therefore, lower density reduces thrust ($T \\downarrow$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the impact on acceleration. The equation of motion during ground roll is: $T - D - \\mu_r (W - L) = (W/g) * a$. A decrease in $T$ directly reduces the net accelerating force ($T - D - F_f$), leading to lower acceleration ($a \\downarrow$).",
          "Step 5: Relate acceleration to ground roll distance ($s$). For a given required lift-off speed ($V_{LO}$), the distance to accelerate from rest is $s \\approx V_{LO}^2 / (2a)$ for constant acceleration, or more generally $s$ increases as acceleration decreases.",
