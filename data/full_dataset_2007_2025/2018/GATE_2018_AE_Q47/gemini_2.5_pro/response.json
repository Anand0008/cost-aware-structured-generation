        "reasoning": "The problem describes an incompressible, laminar flow over a flat plate. The boundary layer thickness ($\\delta$) for such a flow is given by the formula $\\delta = \\frac{5.0x}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}$, where $Re_x = \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty} x}{\\mu_{\\infty}}$. First, the density of air ($\\rho_{\\infty}$) must be calculated using the ideal gas law: $\\rho_{\\infty} = \\frac{P}{RT}$. Given $P = 1 \\text{ bar} = 1 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}$, $T = 300 \\text{ K}$, and $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg K)}$ for air, $\\rho_{\\infty} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^5}{287 \\times 300} \\approx 1.1614 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. Substituting $Re_x$ into the $\\delta$ equation yields $\\delta = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{x \\mu_{\\infty}}{\\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}}}$. Rearranging to solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{\\delta^2 \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}}{5.0^2 \\mu_{\\infty}}$. Plugging in the given values: $\\delta = 0.001 \\text{ m}$, $V_{\\infty} = 20 \\text{ m/s}$, $\\mu_{\\infty} = 1.789 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ kg/(m-s)}$, and the calculated $\\rho_{\\infty} \\approx 1.1614 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. This gives $x = \\frac{(0.001)^2 \\times 1.1614 \\times 20}{25 \\times 1.789 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.0520 \\text{ m}$. Converting to millimeters, $x \\approx 52.0 \\text{ mm}$.

        "notes": "RAG chunks 2, 4, and 5 provided the exact formulas for laminar boundary layer thickness and Reynolds number, which were directly applicable to solving the problem. Chunk 3 offered general context. Chunks 1 and 6 were irrelevant as they pertained to turbulent flow. The RAG context did not provide the ideal gas law or the specific gas constant for air, which was necessary for calculating density; this information was supplemented by the model's internal knowledge."

If the flow velocity is 20 m/s with 1 bar pressure, 300 K temperature, and 1.789x10^-5 kg/(m-s) viscosity, the maximum distance (in mm) of the sensor location from the leading edge is ________ (accurate to one decimal place)."
