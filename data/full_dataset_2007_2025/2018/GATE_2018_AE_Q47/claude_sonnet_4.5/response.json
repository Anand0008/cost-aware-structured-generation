Using the formula for the laminar boundary layer thickness, $\\delta = 5.0x/\\sqrt{Re_x}$, and setting $\\delta = 1$ mm, we can solve for the maximum distance $x$. The given flow conditions of $V_\\infty = 20$ m/s, $p = 1$ bar, $T = 300$ K, and $\\mu = 1.789 \times 10^{-5}$ kg/(m-s) allow us to calculate the local Reynolds number $Re_x$.
