        "notes": "RAG provided excellent coverage of boundary layer formulas for both laminar and turbulent flows. Chunks 2, 4, and 5 gave the laminar boundary layer thickness formula directly, and Chunk 5 provided the Reynolds number definition. The retrieved knowledge was highly relevant and sufficient to answer the question."

If the flow velocity is 20 m/s with 1 bar pressure, 300 K temperature, and 1.789x10^-5 kg/(m-s) viscosity, the maximum distance (in mm) of the sensor location from the leading edge is ________ (accurate to one decimal place)."
