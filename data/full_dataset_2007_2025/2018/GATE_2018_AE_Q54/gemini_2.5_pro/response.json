        "reasoning": "The problem specifies a \"straight radial impeller\" and \"slip-free operation\". For a straight radial impeller, the blade exit angle $\\beta_2$ is $90^\\circ$. This implies that the relative velocity at the exit, $V_{r2}$, is purely radial, so the radial component of absolute velocity, $V_{f2}$, is equal to $V_{r2}$. Given $V_{r2} = 100$ m/s, we have $V_{f2} = 100$ m/s. For slip-free operation, the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the exit, $V_{w2}$, is equal to the impeller tip speed, $U_2$. Given $U_2 = 200$ m/s, we have $V_{w2} = 200$ m/s. The absolute velocity at the impeller exit, $V_2$, is the vector sum of its radial and tangential components. Using the Pythagorean theorem (from the velocity triangle), $V_2 = \\sqrt{V_{f2}^2 + V_{w2}^2} = \\sqrt{(100)^2 + (200)^2} = \\sqrt{10000 + 40000} = \\sqrt{50000} = 100\\sqrt{5} \\approx 223.60679$ m/s.

          "Step 2: Interpret the condition \"straight radial impeller\". For a straight radial impeller, the blade exit angle $\\beta_2$ is $90^\\circ$. This means the relative velocity at the exit ($V_{r2}$) is purely in the radial direction. Therefore, the radial component of the absolute velocity ($V_{f2}$) is equal to the relative velocity ($V_{r2}$). So, $V_{f2} = 100$ m/s.",
          "Step 3: Interpret the condition \"slip-free operation\". Slip-free operation is an ideal condition where the fluid perfectly follows the blade's guidance. This implies that the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the exit ($V_{w2}$) is equal to the impeller tip speed ($U_2$). So, $V_{w2} = 200$ m/s.",
          "Step 4: Apply the velocity triangle relation. The absolute velocity ($V_2$) at the impeller exit is the vector sum of its radial ($V_{f2}$) and tangential ($V_{w2}$) components. Since these components are perpendicular, they form a right-angled triangle, and the absolute velocity can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.",
          "Step 5: Write down the formula for absolute velocity: $V_2 = \\sqrt{V_{f2}^2 + V_{w2}^2}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the calculated values into the formula: $V_2 = \\sqrt{(100)^2 + (200)^2} = \\sqrt{10000 + 40000} = \\sqrt{50000}$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the final value and round to one decimal place: $V_2 \\approx 223.60679$ m/s. Rounded to one decimal place, $V_2 = 223.6$ m/s."
