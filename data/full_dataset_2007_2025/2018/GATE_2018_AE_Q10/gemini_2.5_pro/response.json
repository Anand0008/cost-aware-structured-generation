        "reasoning": "The question asks for the equation of a trajectory of a space object (a general conic section) in polar coordinates. According to fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, the general equation for a conic section with the central body at the focus is given by:\n\n$$\\text{r} = \\frac{\\text{l}}{1 + \\text{e} \\cos(\\theta)}$$\n\nwhere:\n- `r` is the radial distance from the central body.\n- `l` is the semi-latus rectum.\n- `e` is the eccentricity.\n- `θ` is the true anomaly (angle from perigee).\n\nThe semi-latus rectum `l` (often denoted as `p` in some texts) is related to the specific angular momentum `h` and the gravitational parameter `μ` (or `k^2 = GM`) by the formula:\n\n$$\\text{l} = \\frac{\\text{h}^2}{\\mu}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the conic section equation, we get:\n\n$$\\text{r} = \\frac{(\\text{h}^2 / \\mu)}{1 + \\text{e} \\cos(\\theta)}$$\n\nThis matches Option C. The RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) consistently provides this formula, with `p` or `l` being `h^2/k^2` or `h^2/mu`."
