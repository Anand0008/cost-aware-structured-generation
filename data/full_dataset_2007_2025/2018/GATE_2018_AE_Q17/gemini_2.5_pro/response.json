        "reasoning": "Statement [a] is true: Aircraft wings are indeed designed using a closed-section box beam configuration, commonly referred to as a 'torque box'. This structure, typically formed by spars and skin panels, is fundamental to modern aircraft wing design. Statement [r] is also true: Closed-section box beams are highly efficient and capable of resisting torsional loads. This is because they allow for the formation of a continuous shear flow path around the enclosed area, which provides significantly higher torsional rigidity (stiffness) compared to open sections of similar material and perimeter, as explained by Bredt-Batho theory. Furthermore, [r] is the correct reason for [a]: Aircraft wings are subjected to substantial torsional loads during flight due to aerodynamic forces (e.g., lift distribution, control surface deflections). The primary reason for employing a closed-section box beam in wings is precisely its superior capability to resist these torsional loads, ensuring structural integrity, preventing excessive twist, and maintaining aeroelastic stability. Therefore, both statements are true, and [r] provides the correct explanation for [a]."

Aircraft wings are universally constructed around a primary closed box structure, often called a 'torque box', formed by the front and rear spars and the upper and lower skin panels. This configuration is essential for carrying flight loads. Therefore, statement [a] is TRUE.",
          "**Step 2: Analyze Statement [r] - 'Closed-section box beam configuration is capable of resisting torsional loads.'** Recall principles of torsion in thin-walled sections. Closed sections are known to be extremely efficient in resisting torsional loads. This efficiency stems from the ability to develop a continuous shear flow path around the enclosed area, which results in high torsional rigidity (`GJ`). In contrast, open sections are significantly less stiff in torsion, primarily resisting twist through warping. Therefore, statement [r] is TRUE.",
          "**Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between [a] and [r].** Consider why aircraft wings are designed with closed sections. Wings experience significant torsional moments from aerodynamic forces. To prevent excessive twist (which can lead to aeroelastic instability like divergence or flutter) and to maintain structural integrity, the wing structure must possess high torsional stiffness. The closed-section box beam provides this necessary high torsional resistance. Thus, the capability of closed sections to resist torsional loads is the direct and primary reason for their widespread use in aircraft wings.",
