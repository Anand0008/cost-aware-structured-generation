        "reasoning": "Both statements are factually correct, and there is a direct causal link between them. (1) Assertion [a] is true: The primary load-bearing structure of an aircraft wing is indeed a closed-section box beam, often called a torque box or wing box, formed by the front and rear spars and the top and bottom skins. (2) Reason [r] is true: A closed-section configuration is exceptionally effective at resisting torsional (twisting) loads. This is explained by Bredt-Batho theory, where the torsional rigidity ($GJ$) is proportional to the square of the enclosed area ($A^2$) and the wall thickness ($t$), leading to very high efficiency. (3) [r] is the correct reason for [a]: The very high torsional stiffness is the primary design driver for choosing a closed-section box beam in wings, which must efficiently transmit and resist aerodynamic twisting moments (e.g., due to aileron deflection or gusts) to the fuselage."

          "Step 2: Analyze Reason [r]. Recall the mechanics of torsion in thin-walled sections. Closed sections develop a constant shear flow around the perimeter when subjected to torque. Their torsional rigidity ($GJ_{closed}$) is much higher than that of an open section of similar dimensions because it is proportional to $4A^2 / \\oint (ds/t)$, where $A$ is the enclosed area.",
          "Step 3: Compare Torsional Efficiency. For an open section (like a C-channel or I-beam), torsional rigidity ($GJ_{open}$) is roughly proportional to $\\frac{1}{3} \\sum b t^3$, which is orders of magnitude smaller for thin walls ($t^3$ term). Thus, closed sections are specifically chosen where torsional loads are significant.",
          "Step 4: Establish the Causal Link. Aircraft wings experience significant torsional loads. To efficiently resist these loads with minimal weight (a prime aerospace design goal), the closed-section box beam configuration is employed. Therefore, the capability stated in [r] directly explains the design choice stated in [a].",
          "Step 5: Conclude the Logical Relationship. Since both statements are individually true, and the truth of [r] provides the fundamental engineering rationale for the truth of [a], the correct option is A."
