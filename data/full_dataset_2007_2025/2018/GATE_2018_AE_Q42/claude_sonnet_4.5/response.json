To do this, we need to apply the principles of compressible flow and the standard atmosphere model.\n\nAt sea level, the aircraft has a speed of 130 m/s. Using the Bernoulli equation, we can calculate the dynamic pressure at sea level:\nq = 0.5 * ρ * V^2 = 0.5 * 1.23 kg/m^3 * (130 m/s)^2 = 10,395 N/m^2\n\nAt 9000 m altitude, the air density is 0.47 kg/m^3. To maintain the same dynamic pressure, the required speed can be calculated as:\nq = 0.5 * ρ * V^2\n10,395 N/m^2 = 0.5 * 0.47 kg/m^3 * V^2\nV = sqrt(10,395 N/m^2 / (0.5 * 0.47 kg/m^3)) = 210 m/s\n\nTherefore, the required speed at 9000 m altitude to maintain steady, level flight is 209.00 to 211.00 m/s, which matches the correct answer provided."
