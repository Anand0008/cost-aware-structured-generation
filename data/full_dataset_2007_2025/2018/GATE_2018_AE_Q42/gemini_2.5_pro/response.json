Since the gross weight ($W$) is constant, and assuming the wing area ($S$) and lift coefficient ($C_L$) are also constant (implying the aircraft maintains the same angle of attack or configuration to generate the required lift), then the dynamic pressure ($\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$) must remain constant between the two flight conditions.",
