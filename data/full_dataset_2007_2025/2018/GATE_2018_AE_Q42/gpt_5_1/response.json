Since dynamic pressure is $q = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$, equating $q$ at sea level and at 9000 m gives $\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho_{SL} V_{SL}^2 = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho_{9000} V_{9000}^2$. Solving for $V_{9000}$: \n$V_{9000} = V_{SL} \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\rho_{SL}}{\\rho_{9000}}} = 130 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1.23}{0.47}} \\approx 130 \\times 1.619 \\approx 210.5\\,\\text{m/s}$.
