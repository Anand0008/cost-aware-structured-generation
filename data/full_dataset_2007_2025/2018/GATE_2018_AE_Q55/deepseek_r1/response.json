If the pitching moment (M) derivative with respect to angle of attack (alpha), denoted by ‘M_alpha’, is -0.504 N-m/rad and the pitching moment (M) derivative with respect to pitch rate (q), denoted by ‘M_q’, is -0.0336 N-m/(rad/s), the damping ratio of the resulting motion due to an initial disturbance in pitch angle is approximately _________ (accurate to three decimal places)."
