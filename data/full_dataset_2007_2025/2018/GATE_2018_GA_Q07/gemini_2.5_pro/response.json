        "reasoning": "The problem involves calculating the total length of a wire, dividing it based on a given ratio, and then calculating the areas enclosed by the two pieces when bent into a square and a circle, respectively. \n\n1.  **Initial wire length:** If the wire is bent into a square enclosing $1936 \\text{ m}^2$, its side length $s$ is $\\sqrt{1936} = 44 \\text{ m}$. The total length of the wire $L$ is the perimeter of this square, $L = 4s = 4 \\times 44 = 176 \\text{ m}$.\n2.  **Dividing the wire:** The wire is cut into two pieces, with the longer piece ($L_l$) being thrice as long as the shorter piece ($L_s$). So, $L_l = 3L_s$. The total length is $L_s + L_l = 176 \\text{ m}$. Substituting $L_l = 3L_s$, we get $L_s + 3L_s = 176 \\implies 4L_s = 176 \\implies L_s = 44 \\text{ m}$. Consequently, $L_l = 3 \\times 44 = 132 \\text{ m}$.\n3.  **Area of the square (from longer piece):** The longer piece ($132 \\text{ m}$) is bent into a square. The side length of this square $s_l$ is $L_l / 4 = 132 / 4 = 33 \\text{ m}$. The area enclosed by this square $A_{square}$ is $s_l^2 = 33^2 = 1089 \\text{ m}^2$.\n4.  **Area of the circle (from shorter piece):** The shorter piece ($44 \\text{ m}$) is bent into a circle. The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi r = 44 \\text{ m}$. So, the radius $r = 44 / (2\\pi) = 22 / \\pi \\text{ m}$. The area enclosed by this circle $A_{circle}$ is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (22 / \\pi)^2 = \\pi (484 / \\pi^2) = 484 / \\pi \\text{ m}^2$. Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $A_{circle} \\approx 484 / 3.14159 \\approx 154.06 \\text{ m}^2$.\n5.  **Sum of the areas:** The sum of the areas enclosed by the two pieces is $A_{total} = A_{square} + A_{circle} = 1089 + 154.06 = 1243.06 \\text{ m}^2$. This value is closest to option C (1243)."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Calculate the total length of the wire. Given that the wire, when bent into a square, encloses an area of $1936 \\text{ m}^2$, find the side length of this initial square. The area of a square is $s^2$, so $s = \\sqrt{1936} = 44 \\text{ m}$. The total length of the wire is the perimeter of this square, $L = 4s = 4 \\times 44 = 176 \\text{ m}$.",
          "Step 2: Divide the total wire length into two pieces based on the given ratio. Let the length of the shorter piece be $L_s$ and the longer piece be $L_l$. We are given $L_l = 3L_s$. The total length is $L_s + L_l = 176 \\text{ m}$. Substitute $L_l = 3L_s$ into the total length equation: $L_s + 3L_s = 176 \\implies 4L_s = 176 \\implies L_s = 44 \\text{ m}$. The length of the longer piece is $L_l = 3 \\times 44 = 132 \\text{ m}$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the longer piece when bent into a square. The perimeter of this square is $L_l = 132 \\text{ m}$. The side length of this square is $s_l = L_l / 4 = 132 / 4 = 33 \\text{ m}$. The area enclosed by this square is $A_{square} = s_l^2 = 33^2 = 1089 \\text{ m}^2$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the area enclosed by the shorter piece when bent into a circle. The circumference of this circle is $L_s = 44 \\text{ m}$. The formula for circumference is $2\\pi r$, so $2\\pi r = 44 \\implies r = 44 / (2\\pi) = 22 / \\pi \\text{ m}$. The area enclosed by this circle is $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (22 / \\pi)^2 = \\pi (484 / \\pi^2) = 484 / \\pi \\text{ m}^2$.",
          "Step 5: Sum the areas calculated in Step 3 and Step 4. $A_{total} = A_{square} + A_{circle} = 1089 + 484 / \\pi \\text{ m}^2$. Using the approximation $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $A_{total} \\approx 1089 + 154.06 = 1243.06 \\text{ m}^2$. Rounding to the nearest integer, the sum is $1243 \\text{ m}^2$."
