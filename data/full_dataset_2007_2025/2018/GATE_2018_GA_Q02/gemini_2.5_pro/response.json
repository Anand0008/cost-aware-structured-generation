        "reasoning": "The sentence states that the judge's standing was 'shaken by false allegations of wrongdoing,' but then it 'remained _________.' The conjunction 'though' introduces a contrast, implying that despite the initial disturbance, the standing was not negatively affected or was restored. 'Undiminished' means not reduced or lessened, which perfectly fits this context, conveying that the false allegations did not succeed in lowering the judge's reputation. \n\nLet's analyze the other options:\nB. 'damaged': This would contradict the idea that the standing 'remained' in a positive or neutral state after being shaken by *false* allegations. If it remained damaged, the allegations would have had a lasting negative impact.\nC. 'illegal': This word is irrelevant to the concept of a judge's 'standing' or reputation in the community.\nD. 'uncertain': While false allegations might initially create uncertainty, 'remained uncertain' doesn't convey the sense of resilience or maintenance of status that the sentence implies, especially given the 'false' nature of the allegations."

          "Step 3: Understand that 'though' implies a contrast, meaning the final state should be somewhat contrary to or resilient against the initial 'shaking'. The word 'remained' suggests persistence or a lack of negative change.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each option in the context of the sentence:\n    - A. 'undiminished': Means not reduced or lessened. This aligns with the idea that despite being shaken, the standing was maintained at its original level.\n    - B. 'damaged': Implies a negative impact, which contradicts the resilience implied by 'remained' in the face of *false* allegations.\n    - C. 'illegal': This word is unrelated to the concept of a person's 'standing' or reputation.\n    - D. 'uncertain': While allegations can cause uncertainty, 'remained uncertain' doesn't fit the implied resilience against *false* claims; it suggests a continued state of doubt, which isn't the best fit for the contrast.",
          "Step 5: Select the option that best completes the sentence, conveying the intended meaning of resilience and sustained reputation despite the challenge."
