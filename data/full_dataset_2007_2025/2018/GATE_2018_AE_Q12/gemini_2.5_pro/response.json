        "reasoning": "For any airfoil, the pitching moment coefficient about an arbitrary point `x` is related to the pitching moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center (`AC`) by the formula: $C_{m,x} = C_{m,ac} + C_L \\left( \\frac{x_{ac} - x}{c} \\right)$. The question asks for the pitching moment about the leading edge (`x=0`) at the zero lift angle of attack (`C_L = 0`). Substituting these conditions into the formula, we get $C_{m,LE} = C_{m,ac} + 0 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x_{ac} - 0}{c} \\right) = C_{m,ac}$. For a positively cambered NACA airfoil, the pitching moment coefficient about its aerodynamic center ($C_{m,ac}$) is inherently negative (nose-down). This is a fundamental characteristic of cambered airfoils, as their asymmetrical shape, designed to produce lift at zero angle of attack, results in a nose-down pitching moment about the AC. Therefore, the pitching moment about the leading edge at zero lift angle of attack is negative."

          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental properties of a cambered airfoil. A cambered airfoil is designed to generate lift even at zero angle of attack ($C_{L0} > 0$). Crucially, it possesses a constant, non-zero pitching moment coefficient about its aerodynamic center ($C_{m,ac}$).",
          "Step 3: Determine the sign of $C_{m,ac}$ for a cambered airfoil. For conventional positively cambered airfoils, $C_{m,ac}$ is always negative (representing a nose-down pitching moment). This is due to the inherent pressure distribution over its curved surface.",
          "Step 4: Recall the general formula for pitching moment transformation. The pitching moment coefficient about any point $x$ ($C_{m,x}$) can be related to the pitching moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center ($C_{m,ac}$) by the formula: $C_{m,x} = C_{m,ac} + C_L \\left( \\frac{x_{ac} - x}{c} \\right)$, where $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, $x_{ac}$ is the longitudinal position of the aerodynamic center, and $c$ is the chord length.",
          "Step 5: Apply the given conditions to the formula. The question asks for the moment about the \"leading edge,\" which means $x=0$. It also specifies \"zero lift angle of attack,\" which means $C_L = 0$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute these conditions into the formula: $C_{m,LE} = C_{m,ac} + 0 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x_{ac} - 0}{c} \\right)$. This simplifies to $C_{m,LE} = C_{m,ac}$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude the sign of the pitching moment. Since $C_{m,ac}$ for a positively cambered airfoil is negative (from Step 3), the pitching moment about the leading edge at zero lift angle of attack ($C_{m,LE}$) is also negative."
