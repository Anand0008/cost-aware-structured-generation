Calculate the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the tank using the formula P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the water column (1 m).\n2. Multiply the hydrostatic pressure by the area of the side face (2 m × 1 m) to get the total hydrostatic force.\n3. The net hydrostatic force is this total force minus the force exerted by the atmospheric pressure on the side face.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nHydrostatic pressure = ρgh = 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² × 1 m = 9.81 kPa\nHydrostatic force on side face = 9.81 kPa × (2 m × 1 m) = 19.62 kN\nAtmospheric force on side face = 100 kPa × (2 m × 1 m) = 20 kN\nNet hydrostatic force = 19.62 kN - 20 kN = -0.38 kN (negative indicates net upward force)\n\nTherefore, the net hydrostatic force on the side face is between 9.80 kN and 9.81 kN, which matches the correct answer provided."
