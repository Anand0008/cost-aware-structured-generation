The term 'net hydrostatic force' implies considering only the gauge pressure, as atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the tank wall and thus cancels out in terms of net force on the wall.\n\nGiven:\n- Side of cubical tank (width of face, $W$): 2 m\n- Height of water ($h_{water}$): 1 m\n- Density of water ($\\rho$): 1000 kg/m$^3$\n- Acceleration due to gravity ($g$): 9.81 m/s$^2$\n- Atmospheric pressure ($P_{atm}$): 100 kPa (This cancels out for net force)\n\nSteps:\n1.  **Identify the submerged area ($A$)**: The water-filled portion of the side face is a rectangle with width $W = 2$ m and height $h_{water} = 1$ m.
