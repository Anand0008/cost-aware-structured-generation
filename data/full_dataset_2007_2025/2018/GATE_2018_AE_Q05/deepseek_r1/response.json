Deflecting port (left) aileron up reduces lift on the left wing, and deflecting starboard (right) aileron down increases lift on the right wing. This differential lift creates a rolling moment that raises the right wing and lowers the left wing, causing the aircraft to roll with the starboard wing up. Ailerons do not directly cause pitch changes; elevators control pitch, so options A and C are incorrect. The rolling moment is consistent with conventional aileron operation."
