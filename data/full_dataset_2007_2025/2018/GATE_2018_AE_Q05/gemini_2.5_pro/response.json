        "reasoning": "The question describes a specific deflection of ailerons: the port (left) side aileron is deflected up, and the starboard (right) aileron is deflected down. Ailerons are the primary control surfaces for lateral control, inducing a rolling moment about the aircraft's longitudinal axis.\n\n1.  **Port Aileron Up**: When an aileron deflects upward, it reduces the effective camber and local angle of attack of that wing section. This leads to a decrease in lift on the port (left) wing.\n2.  **Starboard Aileron Down**: When an aileron deflects downward, it increases the effective camber and local angle of attack of that wing section. This leads to an increase in lift on the starboard (right) wing.\n3.  **Resulting Rolling Moment**: With less lift on the left wing and more lift on the right wing, a differential lift is created across the wingspan. The increased lift on the starboard wing will cause it to rise, while the decreased lift on the port wing will cause it to drop. This creates a net rolling moment that causes the aircraft to roll with the starboard wing up and the port wing down.\n\nTherefore, option B, 'roll with the starboard wing up', accurately describes the aircraft's motion."

          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of the port (left) aileron deflection. The port aileron is deflected 'up'. An upward deflection of an aileron decreases the local lift generated by that wing section (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4). So, the lift on the left wing will decrease.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of the starboard (right) aileron deflection. The starboard aileron is deflected 'down'. A downward deflection of an aileron increases the local lift generated by that wing section (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4). So, the lift on the right wing will increase.",
          "Step 5: Determine the net rolling motion. With decreased lift on the left wing and increased lift on the right wing, the right wing will experience a greater upward force than the left wing. This differential lift will cause the right wing to rise and the left wing to drop.",
