        "reasoning": "The cross product of two vectors `a` and `b`, denoted as `c = a \\times b`, results in a vector `c` that is inherently orthogonal (perpendicular) to *both* vector `a` and vector `b`. This is a fundamental property of the cross product. Mathematically, this means `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`. If a vector `c` is orthogonal to `a` and also orthogonal to `b`, then `c` must also be orthogonal to any linear combination of `a` and `b`. Specifically, for the sum `a + b`, we can use the distributive property of the dot product: `c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b`. Since `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`, it follows that `c \\cdot (a + b) = 0 + 0 = 0`. Therefore, `c` is orthogonal to `a + b`. Option A is incorrect because `a` and `b` are stated as 'not parallel', which means their cross product `a \\times b` is a non-zero vector. Options B and D are true statements (c is orthogonal to a, and c is orthogonal to b), but the word 'alone' can be misleading in a multiple-choice context where a more comprehensive or derived property might be the intended answer. Option C is a direct and correct consequence of the fundamental property of the cross product."

          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'zero'. The cross product `a \\times b` is zero if and only if `a` and `b` are parallel. The question states that `a` and `b` are 'not parallel', so `c = a \\times b` cannot be the zero vector. Thus, Option A is incorrect.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Options B and D: 'orthogonal to a alone' and 'orthogonal to b alone'. While `c` is indeed orthogonal to `a` and `b`, the word 'alone' might be interpreted as an exclusive condition. However, the core property holds for both.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'orthogonal to a + b'. To check this, we use the property of the dot product: `c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b` (distributive property).",
          "Step 6: Substitute the orthogonality conditions from Step 2: Since `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`, the equation becomes `c \\cdot (a + b) = 0 + 0 = 0`.",
