To solve this, we can use the Karman-Tsien compressibility correction formula to adjust the given pressure coefficient of -1.2 at M_∞ = 0.1 to the new pressure coefficient at M_∞ = 0.6.\n\nApplying the Karman-Tsien formula:\nC_p = C_p,0 / (sqrt(1 - M_∞^2) + (M_∞^2 / (1 + sqrt(1 - M_∞^2))) * (C_p,0 / 2))\nSubstituting the given values:\nC_p = -1.2 / (sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) + (0.6^2 / (1 + sqrt(1 - 0.6^2))) * (-1.2 / 2))\nC_p = -1.5\n\nTherefore, the pressure coefficient at the same point on the airfoil when the freestream Mach number is increased to 0.6 is approximately -1.5, which matches the correct answer C."
