        "reasoning": "The problem asks to find the pressure coefficient at a higher freestream Mach number ($M_{\\infty} = 0.6$) given its value at a low Mach number ($M_{\\infty} = 0.1$). This is a classic application of compressibility correction formulas in aerodynamics.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Data:**\n    *   Initial pressure coefficient at $M_{\\infty,1} = 0.1$ is $C_{p,1} = -1.2$.\n    *   New freestream Mach number is $M_{\\infty,2} = 0.6$.\n\n2.  **Determine Incompressible Pressure Coefficient ($C_{p,0}$):**\n    For low Mach numbers (typically $M_{\\infty} < 0.3$), the flow can be approximated as incompressible, and the measured pressure coefficient is very close to the incompressible pressure coefficient ($C_{p,0}$). Therefore, we can assume $C_{p,0} \\approx C_{p,1} = -1.2$.\n    (A more rigorous approach would be to use the Prandtl-Glauert rule to find $C_{p,0}$ from $C_{p,1}$ at $M_{\\infty,1}=0.1$, which yields $C_{p,0} = -1.2 \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0.1^2} \\approx -1.194$. However, for 'approximate' questions in GATE, the direct assumption is often intended, and the difference is negligible).\n\n3.  **Apply Prandtl-Glauert Compressibility Correction:**\n    The Prandtl-Glauert rule is a widely used linear compressibility correction for subsonic flow, given by:\n    $C_p = \\frac{C_{p,0}}{\\sqrt{1 - M_{\\infty}^2}}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    Using $C_{p,0} = -1.2$ and $M_{\\infty} = 0.6$:\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{0.64}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{0.8}$\n    $C_p = -1.5$\n\nThis result matches option C. While the Karman-Tsien rule (a more accurate non-linear correction) would yield a slightly different value (approx. -1.76), the fact that -1.5 is an option strongly suggests the Prandtl-Glauert approximation is expected for this 'approximate' calculation."
