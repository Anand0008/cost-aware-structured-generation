When the freestream Mach number increases to $M_\\infty = 0.6$, compressibility effects increase the magnitude of $C_p$. For thin airfoils at subsonic Mach numbers, the Prandtl–Glauert rule is an appropriate first-order correction: $C_p = \\dfrac{C_{p,0}}{\\sqrt{1 - M_\\infty^2}}$. Substituting $C_{p,0} = -1.2$ and $M_\\infty = 0.6$ gives $C_p = -1.2 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2} = -1.2 / \\sqrt{0.64} = -1.2 / 0.8 = -1.5$.
