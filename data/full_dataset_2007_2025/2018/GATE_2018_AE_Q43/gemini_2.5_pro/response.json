        "reasoning": "The problem requires a sequential application of fundamental aerodynamic principles. First, the true airspeed is calculated using the Pitot-static formula, which relates the total and static pressures to the dynamic pressure and thus velocity. Second, this calculated airspeed, along with the given air density, wing area, and lift coefficient, is used in the lift equation to determine the total lift generated by the wing. For an aircraft in steady, level flight, the lift generated is equal to its weight. Finally, the wing loading is found by dividing the total lift (which equals weight) by the given wing area. All calculations are direct and based on well-established formulas, leading to a result of 19440 N/m^2, which falls within the specified acceptable range."
