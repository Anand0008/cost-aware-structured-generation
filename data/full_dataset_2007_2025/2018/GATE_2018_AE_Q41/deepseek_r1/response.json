          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental longitudinal static stability relationship. For an aircraft, the change in pitching moment coefficient with angle of attack is proportional to the distance between the center of gravity (CG) and the neutral point (NP): $$\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = C_{L_\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{x_{cg} - x_{np}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$$ where $x_{cg}$ and $x_{np}$ are measured from a fixed reference (e.g., leading edge) positive aft.

          "Step 5: Apply the sign convention specified in the question. The location of the neutral point from the center of gravity is asked with 'positive towards the nose'. The vector from CG to NP is $x_{np} - x_{cg}$ in the coordinate system where positive is aft. To express this as a distance with positive towards nose, we take the negative: $$\\text{Distance (CG to NP, positive towards nose)} = -(x_{np} - x_{cg}) = x_{cg} - x_{np}$$ Hence, the distance is $x_{cg} - x_{np} = -0.8$ m.",
