        "reasoning": "The pitching moment coefficient about the center of gravity is given as $C_{m,cg} = 0.05 - 4 \\alpha$. To find the pitching moment derivative with respect to the angle of attack, we differentiate this expression:\n$\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} (0.05 - 4 \\alpha) = -4$\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the pitching moment derivative, the lift curve slope, and the relative position of the neutral point ($X_{NP}$) with respect to the center of gravity ($X_{CG}$) is given by:\n$\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = C_{L,\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{X_{NP} - X_{CG}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$\n\nGiven values are:\n*   $C_{L,\\alpha} = 5$ (per radian)\n*   $\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = -4$\n*   Mean aerodynamic chord $\\bar{c} = 1 \\text{ m}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n$-4 = 5 \\left( \\frac{X_{NP} - X_{CG}}{1} \\right)$\n$-4 = 5 (X_{NP} - X_{CG})$\n$X_{NP} - X_{CG} = \\frac{-4}{5} = -0.8 \\text{ m}$\n\nThe question asks for the location (positive towards the nose) of the neutral point of the aircraft from the center of gravity. A negative value for $(X_{NP} - X_{CG})$ indicates that the neutral point is located behind the center of gravity. This is consistent with the aircraft being statically stable, as static stability requires the center of gravity to be ahead of the neutral point ($X_{CG} > X_{NP}$). If $X_{NP} - X_{CG} = -0.8 \\text{ m}$, it means $X_{NP}$ is $0.8 \\text{ m}$ behind $X_{CG}$, which implies $X_{CG}$ is $0.8 \\text{ m}$ ahead of $X_{NP}$. This confirms static stability. The calculated value of $-0.8 \\text{ m}$ falls within the acceptable range of the answer key ($-0.81$ to $-0.79$).\n\nNote on formula consistency: While some texts might use $\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = C_{L,\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{X_{CG} - X_{NP}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$, the form $\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = C_{L,\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{X_{NP} - X_{CG}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$ is derived from $C_{m,cg} = C_{m,NP} + C_L \\frac{X_{NP} - X_{CG}}{\\bar{c}}$ and is consistent with the stability condition $\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0$ when $X_{CG} > X_{NP}$ (i.e., $X_{NP} - X_{CG} < 0$)."

          "Step 6: Interpret the sign of the result. The question specifies 'positive towards the nose'. A negative result for $(X_{NP} - X_{CG})$ means the neutral point is located behind the center of gravity, which is consistent with the aircraft being statically stable."
