        "reasoning": "A downward deflection of a trailing-edge flap increases the effective camber of the airfoil. From thin airfoil theory and high-lift device theory, increasing camber makes the zero-lift angle of attack more negative and increases lift at any given geometric \\alpha, while the lift-curve slope a = dC_L/d\\alpha remains approximately unchanged. On a C_L vs \\alpha plot, this appears as an upward shift of the line and a shift to the left (towards more negative \\alpha for zero lift). Since the question only allows us to choose between left/right shift and slope increase/same, the correct description is that the curve shifts left and the slope stays (approximately) the same. Hence option C."
