This is because the downward flap deflection effectively increases the airfoil's camber, which shifts the zero-lift angle of attack (alpha_L=0) to a more negative value. The lift curve slope (dC_L/dalpha) is primarily determined by the airfoil's shape and is not significantly affected by flap deflection, as per thin airfoil theory."
