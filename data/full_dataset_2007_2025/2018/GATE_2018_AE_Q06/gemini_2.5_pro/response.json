        "reasoning": "The question asks about the effect of deflecting a trailing-edge flap downwards on the lift coefficient ($C_L$) versus angle of attack ($\\alpha$) curve. Based on fundamental aerodynamics principles and the provided RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):\n\n1.  **Shift of the $C_L$ vs. $\\alpha$ curve:** Downward deflection of a trailing-edge flap increases the effective camber of the airfoil. This increase in camber causes the airfoil to generate more lift at any given angle of attack. Consequently, the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) becomes more negative. A more negative $\\alpha_{L=0}$ means the entire $C_L$ vs. $\\alpha$ curve shifts to the left (or upwards, which is equivalent for a positive slope).\n2.  **Lift curve slope ($dC_L/d\\alpha$):** The lift curve slope, which represents how much lift increases per degree of angle of attack, is primarily a function of the airfoil shape and aspect ratio (for finite wings). For an airfoil (2D case), the theoretical lift curve slope is approximately $2\\pi$ per radian. Trailing-edge flap deflection, while changing the effective camber, does not significantly alter the fundamental rate at which lift changes with angle of attack in the linear region. Therefore, the lift curve slope remains largely unchanged.\n\nCombining these two effects, the $C_L$ versus $\\alpha$ curve shifts left, and its slope stays the same. This corresponds to option C."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of a trailing-edge flap. Trailing-edge flaps are high-lift devices designed to increase the lift generated by an airfoil, particularly at low speeds during takeoff and landing.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect of downward flap deflection on airfoil camber. Deflecting a trailing-edge flap downwards effectively increases the camber of the airfoil. This is akin to making the airfoil 'more curved' downwards.",
          "Step 3: Determine the impact of increased camber on the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$). For a cambered airfoil, lift is generated even at zero angle of attack. Increasing camber makes the airfoil generate even more lift at $\\alpha=0$, or equivalently, requires a more negative angle of attack to achieve zero lift. Thus, $\\alpha_{L=0}$ becomes more negative, which translates to a leftward shift of the $C_L$ vs. $\\alpha$ curve.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the effect on the lift curve slope ($dC_L/d\\alpha$). The lift curve slope in the linear region is primarily determined by the basic geometry of the airfoil and is theoretically $2\\pi$ per radian for a thin airfoil. While flaps significantly change the lift at a given angle of attack, they do not substantially alter the rate of change of lift with angle of attack. Therefore, the lift curve slope remains approximately the same.",
          "Step 5: Combine the observations. A leftward shift of the curve (due to a more negative $\\alpha_{L=0}$) and an unchanged lift curve slope lead to the conclusion that the $C_L$ vs. $\\alpha$ curve shifts left and its slope stays the same."
