According to thin airfoil theory and experimental results (as detailed in the RAG context), this shifts the entire lift curve upward and to the left: the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) becomes more negative. The lift curve slope ($dC_L/d\\alpha$) is a function of the airfoil's geometry and Mach number and, for incompressible flow, is approximately $2\\pi$ per radian for a thin airfoil. This slope is fundamentally related to the circulation distribution and is not significantly altered by a change in camber (i.e., flap deflection) for moderate deflections. Therefore, the curve shifts left, and the slope remains essentially the same."
