It often implies that two things go well together or one thing completes another.\n    *   In the first blank, 'The dress _________ her so well', the meaning is that the dress enhanced her appearance or made her look better. Thus, 'complemented' is the correct word.\n\n2.  **Compliment (verb)**: To express praise, admiration, or congratulation. It is a polite expression of praise.\n    *   In the second blank, 'they all immediately _________ her on her appearance', the meaning is that they praised her for how she looked. Thus, 'complimented' is the correct word.\n\nCombining these, the correct pair is 'complemented, complimented', which corresponds to option D."
