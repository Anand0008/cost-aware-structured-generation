Using the exponential atmosphere density formula, we can calculate the density at 3500 m as follows:\n\n$\\rho = \\rho_0 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{g_0 h}{RT}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\\rho = 1.225 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{9.81 \\cdot 3500}{287 \\cdot 288.16}}$\n$\\rho \\approx 0.86 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n\nThis result falls within the correct answer range of 0.85 to 0.88 kg/m^3, so the answer key is correct."
