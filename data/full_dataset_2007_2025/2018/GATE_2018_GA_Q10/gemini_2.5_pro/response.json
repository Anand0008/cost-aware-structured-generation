Each coin toss is an independent event, which means the outcome of previous tosses (like HHHT in the fourth trial) does not influence the outcomes of subsequent tosses. We need to find the probability of the outcomes for the last two tosses (5th and 6th) of the fourth trial.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each option for the 5th and 6th tosses:\n\n*   **Option A: Two T will occur (TT)**\n    The probability of getting a Tail on the 5th toss is $0.5$, and on the 6th toss is $0.5$. Since these are independent events:\n    $P(TT) = P(T \\text{ on 5th toss}) \\times P(T \\text{ on 6th toss}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$\n\n*   **Option B: One H and one T will occur.**\n    This outcome can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: HT (Head then Tail) or TH (Tail then Head).\n    $P(HT) = P(H \\text{ on 5th toss}) \\times P(T \\text{ on 6th toss}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$\n    $P(TH) = P(T \\text{ on 5th toss}) \\times P(H \\text{ on 6th toss}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$\n    Since HT and TH are mutually exclusive events, the probability of \"one H and one T\" is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{one H and one T}) = P(HT) + P(TH) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50$\n\n*   **Option C: Two H will occur (HH)**\n    The probability of getting a Head on the 5th toss is $0.5$, and on the 6th toss is $0.5$. Since these are independent events:\n    $P(HH) = P(H \\text{ on 5th toss}) \\times P(H \\text{ on 6th toss}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$\n\n*   **Option D: One H will be followed by one T (HT)**\n    This is a specific sequence: Head on the 5th toss, followed by Tail on the 6th toss.\n    $P(HT) = P(H \\text{ on 5th toss}) \\times P(T \\text{ on 6th toss}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$\n\nComparing the probabilities for each option:\n$P(\\text{Option A}) = 0.25$\n$P(\\text{Option B}) = 0.50$\n$P(\\text{Option C}) = 0.25$\n$P(\\text{Option D}) = 0.25$\n\nOption B has the highest probability of $0.50$."

          "Step 1: Identify the core principles. The problem states an \"unbiased coin,\" which means the probability of getting a Head ($P(H)$) or a Tail ($P(T)$) in any single toss is $0.5$. Each coin toss is an \"independent event,\" meaning the outcome of previous tosses (e.g., HHHT in the fourth trial) does not influence the outcome of subsequent tosses.",
          "Step 2: Determine the events in question. We need to find the probability of the outcomes for the last two tosses (the 5th and 6th tosses) of the fourth trial. The preceding HHHT is irrelevant due to the independence of each toss.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the probability for each possible two-toss sequence. For two independent tosses, the possible outcomes are HH, HT, TH, and TT. Each has a probability of $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each option based on these probabilities:\n    *   Option A: \"Two T will occur\" corresponds to the sequence TT, with $P(TT) = 0.25$.\n    *   Option B: \"One H and one T will occur\" means either HT or TH. Since these are mutually exclusive, we sum their probabilities: $P(HT) + P(TH) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50$.\n    *   Option C: \"Two H will occur\" corresponds to the sequence HH, with $P(HH) = 0.25$.\n    *   Option D: \"One H will be followed by one T\" corresponds to the specific sequence HT, with $P(HT) = 0.25$.",
          "Step 5: Compare the probabilities calculated for each option. Option B has a probability of $0.50$, while Options A, C, and D each have a probability of $0.25$. Therefore, Option B has the highest probability."
