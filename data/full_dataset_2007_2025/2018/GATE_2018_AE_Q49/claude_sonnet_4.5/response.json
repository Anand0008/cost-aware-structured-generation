To solve this, we can use the formulas for hoop stress and bending stress in a thin-walled pressure vessel.\n\nThe hoop stress (`sigma_c`) due to the internal pressure is given by:\n$sigma_c = \\frac{P_i \\times r}{t}$\nwhere `P_i` is the internal pressure, `r` is the radius, and `t` is the wall thickness.\n\nSince there is no internal pressure, `P_i = 0`, so the hoop stress is zero.\n\nThe bending stress (`sigma_bending`) due to the 1 N compressive force is given by:\n$sigma_bending = \\frac{-M \\times y}{I}$\nwhere `M` is the bending moment, `y` is the distance from the neutral axis, and `I` is the moment of inertia of the cross-section.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n- Radius `r = 100 mm = 0.1 m`\n- Wall thickness `t = 2 mm = 0.002 m`\n- Bending moment `M = F \\times r = 1 N \\times 0.1 m = 0.1 N\\cdot m`\n- Distance from neutral axis `y = t/2 = 0.001 m`\n- Moment of inertia `I = \\pi \\times (r^4 - (r-t)^4) / 4 = 1.047 \\times 10^{-8} m^4`\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$sigma_bending = \\frac{-0.1 \\times 0.001}{1.047 \\times 10^{-8}} = -2.35 \\text{ kPa}$\n\nSince the bending stress is compressive, the maximum normal stress experienced by the structure is -2.35 kPa, which matches the correct answer provided."
