The maximum normal stress (in magnitude, which is compressive in this case) occurs at the extreme fiber where both axial and bending stresses are compressive. The steps involve calculating the mean radius, cross-sectional area, moment of inertia, axial stress, bending moment, and bending stress, then superimposing them. The calculated value of -2.41 kPa falls within the provided correct answer range of -2.50 to -2.20."

Since it's a thin-walled tube, we use the mean radius for calculations: $R_{mean} = R_o - t/2 = 0.1 - 0.002/2 = 0.099 \\text{ m}$.",
          "**Step 2: Calculate Cross-sectional Area (A).** For a thin-walled tube, the cross-sectional area is approximated as $A = 2 \\pi R_{mean} t$. Substituting the values: $A = 2 \\pi (0.099 \\text{ m})(0.002 \\text{ m}) = 0.00124407 \\text{ m}^2$.",
          "**Step 3: Calculate Axial Compressive Stress ($\\sigma_a$).** The compressive force $F = 1 \\text{ N}$ acts axially. The axial stress is $\\sigma_a = -F/A$ (negative for compression): $\\sigma_a = -1 \\text{ N} / 0.00124407 \\text{ m}^2 = -803.81 \\text{ Pa}$.",
          "**Step 4: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I).** For a thin-walled circular tube, the moment of inertia about a diameter is $I = \\pi R_{mean}^3 t$. Substituting the values: $I = \\pi (0.099 \\text{ m})^3 (0.002 \\text{ m}) = 6.0953 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4$.",

The bending moment is $M = F \\times e = 1 \\text{ N} \\times 0.099 \\text{ m} = 0.099 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}$.",

However, specific formulas for the cross-sectional area and moment of inertia of a thin-walled tube were primarily drawn from internal knowledge, though implied by the 'thin-walled' context."
