This creates an eccentric axial load with eccentricity e equal to the external radius (distance from centroid to point of application).",

Cross-sectional area A = π(R_o² - R_i²) = π(0.01 - 0.009604) = 0.001244 m². Moment of inertia about diameter I = π/64 (D_o⁴ - D_i⁴) = π/4 (R_o⁴ - R_i⁴) = 6.0975e-6 m⁴. Eccentricity e = R_o = 0.1 m.",

Bending stress at the point of application (maximum compressive) σ_bending = M * y / I, where y = distance from neutral axis to extreme fiber in direction of eccentricity = R_o = 0.1 m.
