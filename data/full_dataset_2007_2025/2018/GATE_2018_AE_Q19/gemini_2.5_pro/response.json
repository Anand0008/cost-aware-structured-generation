An isentropic process is defined as a reversible adiabatic process, meaning there is no heat transfer ($dQ = 0$) and no internal irreversibilities (such as friction or turbulence). This idealization represents the most efficient possible compression and expansion for a given pressure ratio, maximizing work output from the turbine and minimizing work input to the compressor. On a Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagram, an isentropic process is represented by a vertical line, indicating constant entropy ($dS = 0$). Therefore, the expansion in an ideal gas turbine is an isentropic process."
