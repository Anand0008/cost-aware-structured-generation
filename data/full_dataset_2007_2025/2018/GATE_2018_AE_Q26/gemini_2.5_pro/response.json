Substituting this into the ODE yields the characteristic equation:$$r^2 e^{rx} + 3r e^{rx} = 0$$$$e^{rx}(r^2 + 3r) = 0$$Since $e^{rx} \\neq 0$, the characteristic equation is $r^2 + 3r = 0$.Factoring gives $r(r+3) = 0$, so the roots are $r_1 = 0$ and $r_2 = -3$.For distinct real roots, the general solution is of the form $y(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}$.Substituting the roots:$$y(x) = C_1 e^{0x} + C_2 e^{-3x}$$ $$y(x) = C_1 + C_2 e^{-3x}$$Now, we apply the initial conditions.First, find the derivative of $y(x)$ with respect to $x$:$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(C_1 + C_2 e^{-3x}) = -3C_2 e^{-3x}$$Given initial conditions:1. $y = 0$ at $x = 0$:$$0 = C_1 + C_2 e^{0} \\implies C_1 + C_2 = 0 \\quad (1)$$2. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1$ at $x = 0$:$$1 = -3C_2 e^{0} \\implies 1 = -3C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3} \\quad (2)$$Substitute $C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}$ into equation (1):$$C_1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$$Finally, substitute the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution:$$y(x) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) e^{-3x}$$ $$y(x) = \\frac{1}{3} (1 - e^{-3x})$$This solution matches option B."
