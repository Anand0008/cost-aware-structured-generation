        "reasoning": "In an elliptical orbit, a spacecraft's motion is governed by Kepler's Second Law, which states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun (or a spacecraft and its central body) sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This law is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum (H) of a spacecraft in orbit is given by $H = r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the central body and $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the angular velocity (often denoted as $\\omega$). Since angular momentum is conserved, $r^2 \\omega = \\text{constant}$. This implies that $\\omega$ is inversely proportional to $r^2$. Therefore, to have the maximum angular velocity, the spacecraft must be at the point where its radial distance $r$ is minimum. This point is the periapsis (or perigee for Earth orbits), which is the closest point to the central body. Conversely, the angular velocity is minimum at the apoapsis (or apogee), where $r$ is maximum. This is also consistent with the physical intuition mentioned in CHUNK 1, which states that 'Satellites in elliptical orbits behave similarly, speeding up at perigee and slowing down at apogee.' Speeding up implies both higher linear and angular velocity."

          "Step 1: Understand the concept of angular velocity in an orbit. Angular velocity ($\\omega$) is the rate of change of the true anomaly (angle) with respect to time, i.e., $\\omega = \\dot{\\theta}$.",
          "Step 2: Recall Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion, which states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This law is a manifestation of the conservation of angular momentum.",
          "Step 3: Express angular momentum (H) in terms of radial distance (r) and angular velocity ($\\omega$). For an orbiting body, angular momentum is given by $H = m r^2 \\omega$, where $m$ is the mass of the spacecraft. Since $m$ is constant and angular momentum $H$ is conserved in a two-body problem, the product $r^2 \\omega$ must be constant.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the relationship between $r$ and $\\omega$. From $r^2 \\omega = \\text{constant}$, it is clear that $\\omega$ is inversely proportional to $r^2$. This means that as $r$ decreases, $\\omega$ increases, and vice-versa.",
          "Step 5: Identify the points of minimum and maximum radial distance in an elliptical orbit. Periapsis is the point in the orbit where the spacecraft is closest to the central body (minimum $r$). Apoapsis is the point where it is furthest (maximum $r$).",
          "Step 6: Conclude the location of maximum angular velocity. Since $\\omega$ is maximum when $r$ is minimum, the spacecraft will have its maximum angular velocity at periapsis."
