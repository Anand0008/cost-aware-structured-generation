P: All the points in the body undergo displacements in one plane only, for example the x-y plane, leading to epsilon_zz = gamma_xz = gamma_yz = 0. Q: All the components of stress perpendicular to the plane of deformation, for example the x-y plane, of the body are equal to zero, i.e. sigma_zz = tau_xz = tau_yz = 0. R: Except the normal component, all the other components of stress perpendicular to the plane of deformation of the body, for example the x-y plane, are equal to zero, i.e. sigma_zz != 0, tau_xz = tau_yz = 0."
