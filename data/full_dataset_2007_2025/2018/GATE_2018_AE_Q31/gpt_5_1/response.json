In plane strain (deformation in the x-y plane): the out-of-plane normal and shear strains are zero, i.e. \\(\\epsilon_{zz} = 0\\), \\(\\gamma_{xz} = 0\\), \\(\\gamma_{yz} = 0\\). This is exactly what statement P says, so P is true. However, even though out-of-plane strains are zero, the corresponding stresses need not be zero. From generalized Hooke\\'s law for plane strain, we typically have \\(\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\\neq 0\\) in general, while \\(\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0\\). Thus, statement Q (all out-of-plane stresses zero) is false, and statement R (only the normal out-of-plane stress may be non-zero, shear components zero) is true. Therefore, the correct combination is P and R, i.e. option D, matching the official key."

          "Step 2: Compare this with statement P. It says all points undergo displacements in one plane (x-y), leading to \\(\\epsilon_{zz} = \\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0\\). This matches the standard definition of plane strain, so P is true.",
          "Step 3: Recall the stress state in plane strain. Even though out-of-plane strains are zero, the body can develop out-of-plane normal stress \\(\\sigma_{zz}\\) to enforce \\(\\epsilon_{zz} = 0\\). From generalized Hooke's law, \\(\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\\) in plane strain, which is generally non-zero. However, because \\(\\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0\\), the corresponding shear stresses \\(\\tau_{xz}\\) and \\(\\tau_{yz}\\) are zero.",
          "Step 4: Check statement Q. It claims all stress components perpendicular to the plane (\\(\\sigma_{zz}, \\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz}\\)) are zero. This is the definition of plane stress, not plane strain. Hence Q is false for plane strain.",
