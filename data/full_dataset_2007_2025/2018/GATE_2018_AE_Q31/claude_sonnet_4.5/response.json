This is because the material is constrained from deforming in the out-of-plane direction, leading to a non-zero normal stress but zero shear stresses.\n\nStatement Q, which states that all stress components perpendicular to the plane of deformation are zero, is not correct, as `sigma_zz` is generally non-zero in plane strain."
