        "notes": "RAG chunks (1,2,4,5,6) provided relevant background on rocket equation and specific impulse definition, but did not directly contain the exact problem. Chunk 2 gave a worked example with specific impulse calculation using thrust and mass flow rate, which is very helpful. Chunks 1,4,5,6 focused on rocket equation derivation and burnout velocity calculation, which is related but not directly needed. The video chunk (3) was about initial acceleration, marginally relevant. Overall, RAG context supported the solution but the problem is simple enough to solve with fundamental knowledge."
