        "reasoning": "The unit normal to an equipotential surface of a scalar field is in the direction of its gradient. For the potential function $\\phi(r) = \\dfrac{1}{r^2 + 4}$ with $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, we first compute $\\nabla \\phi$ in Cartesian coordinates, then evaluate at $(1,1)$, and finally normalize to get the unit normal vector.\\n1. Write $\\phi$ as a function of $x,y$: $\\phi(x,y) = \\dfrac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + 4}$.\\n2. Compute partial derivatives: $\\dfrac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = -\\dfrac{2x}{(x^2 + y^2 + 4)^2}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = -\\dfrac{2y}{(x^2 + y^2 + 4)^2}$.\\n3. At $(1,1)$, $x^2 + y^2 + 4 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6$, so $\\nabla \\phi(1,1) = \\left(-\\dfrac{2}{6^2}, -\\dfrac{2}{6^2}\\right) = \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{18}, -\\dfrac{1}{18}\\right)$.\\n4. The magnitude is $\\left\\lVert \\nabla \\phi \\right\\rVert = \\sqrt{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{18}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{18}\\right)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{18}\\sqrt{2}$.\\n5. The unit normal vector (up to sign) is $\\hat{n} = \\dfrac{\\nabla \\phi}{\\lVert \\nabla \\phi \\rVert} = \\left( -\\dfrac{1/18}{(1/18)\\sqrt{2}}, -\\dfrac{1/18}{(1/18)\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\left( -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)$.\\n6. The question asks for the magnitude of the x-component of this unit vector, so we take $\\left| -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right| = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7071$, which rounds to 0.71, lying within the official range 0.68 to 0.73."
