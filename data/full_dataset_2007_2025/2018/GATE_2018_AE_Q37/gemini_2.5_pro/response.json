        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the x-component of a unit vector normal to equi-potential lines. Equi-potential lines are level curves of the potential function $\\phi(x, y) = C$. A fundamental property of scalar fields is that the gradient vector $\\nabla\\phi$ is always normal (perpendicular) to its level curves. Therefore, the solution involves the following steps:\n1.  **Express $\\phi(r)$ in Cartesian coordinates:** Given $\\phi(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2 + 4}$ and $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, we substitute $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ to get $\\phi(x, y) = \\frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + 4}$.\n2.  **Calculate the gradient $\\nabla\\phi$:** The gradient is $\\nabla\\phi = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^2 + y^2 + 4)^{-1} = -1 \\cdot (x^2 + y^2 + 4)^{-2} \\cdot (2x) = \\frac{-2x}{(x^2 + y^2 + 4)^2}$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^2 + y^2 + 4)^{-1} = -1 \\cdot (x^2 + y^2 + 4)^{-2} \\cdot (2y) = \\frac{-2y}{(x^2 + y^2 + 4)^2}$.\n3.  **Evaluate $\\nabla\\phi$ at the point $(1, 1)$:**\n    *   At $(1, 1)$, $x^2 + y^2 + 4 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 4 = 6$. So, $(x^2 + y^2 + 4)^2 = 36$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} \\Big|_{(1,1)} = \\frac{-2(1)}{36} = -\\frac{1}{18}$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} \\Big|_{(1,1)} = \\frac{-2(1)}{36} = -\\frac{1}{18}$.\n    *   Thus, $\\nabla\\phi \\Big|_{(1,1)} = -\\frac{1}{18}\\hat{i} - \\frac{1}{18}\\hat{j}$.\n4.  **Calculate the magnitude of $\\nabla\\phi$ at $(1, 1)$:**\n    *   $|\\nabla\\phi| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{18}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{18}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{324} + \\frac{1}{324}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{324}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{162}}$.\n    *   $|\\nabla\\phi| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{162}} = \\frac{1}{9\\sqrt{2}}$.\n5.  **Normalize $\\nabla\\phi$ to get the unit normal vector $\\hat{n}$:**\n    *   $\\hat{n} = \\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{18}\\hat{i} - \\frac{1}{18}\\hat{j}}{\\frac{1}{9\\sqrt{2}}} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{18} \\cdot 9\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\hat{i} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{18} \\cdot 9\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\hat{j}$.\n    *   $\\hat{n} = \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\hat{i} + \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\hat{j}$.\n6.  **Extract the magnitude of the x-component:** The x-component is $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Its magnitude is $\\left|-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n    *   Numerically, $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.4142}{2} \\approx 0.7071$.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the answer is $0.71$. This value falls within the acceptable range of $0.68$ to $0.73$ provided by the answer key."

Chunk 6 was useful for understanding the definition of 'r'. Chunk 1 discussed orthogonality but contained a minor inaccuracy regarding the direction of `grad(phi)` relative to potential lines (it's normal, not tangent), which was clarified by Chunk 3's accurate definition. Overall, RAG provided strong support for the core concepts and method."
