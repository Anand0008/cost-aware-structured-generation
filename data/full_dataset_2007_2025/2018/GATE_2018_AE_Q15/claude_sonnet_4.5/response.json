When a fluid passes through a normal shock wave, the static temperature increases due to the conversion of kinetic energy to internal energy. However, the total temperature (or stagnation temperature) also increases across the shock, as the total enthalpy is conserved. This is because the shock is an irreversible process, and there is an increase in entropy, leading to a rise in both static and total temperature."
