        "reasoning": "When a shock wave moves into still air, the air passes through the shock from a quiescent state to a post-shock state. This is analogous to still air encountering a stationary shock. According to fundamental compressible flow theory and the provided RAG context:\n\n1.  **Static Temperature (T):** As the air passes through the shock, its kinetic energy is converted into internal energy due to the abrupt deceleration. This leads to a significant *increase* in static temperature ($T_2 > T_1$). This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunk 2 ('Static temperature increases') and Chunk 3 ('T2/T1 > 1. Static temperature *increases*'). Therefore, the first part of option B ('static temperature increases') is correct.\n\n2.  **Total Temperature (T₀):** For an adiabatic normal shock wave in a calorically perfect gas, the total enthalpy remains constant. Since total enthalpy is directly proportional to total temperature ($h_0 = c_p T_0$), the **total temperature (or stagnation temperature) remains constant** across the shock ($T_{0,1} = T_{0,2}$). This is consistently stated in RAG Chunk 1 ('total temperature is constant (T₀,₁ = T₀,₂)') and RAG Chunk 4 ('Across a normal shock wave, the stagnation temperature remains constant. ... T01 = T02'). Therefore, the second part of option B ('total temperature increases') is generally considered **incorrect** under standard ideal shock wave assumptions.\n\nGiven the strong theoretical basis and consistent RAG context indicating that total temperature remains constant, option B, which states total temperature increases, is fundamentally contradictory to ideal shock wave theory. However, adhering to the instruction to validate the provided answer key, option B is marked as correct. This implies a potential deviation from standard assumptions, or an error in the question or its key."

          "Step 2: Recall the behavior of static properties across a normal shock. When a fluid passes through a normal shock, its velocity decreases, and this kinetic energy is converted into internal energy. This conversion leads to an abrupt increase in static pressure, static temperature, and static density. (RAG Chunk 2, 3)",
          "Step 3: Specifically, confirm the change in static temperature. The static temperature of the air *increases* across the shock wave. This makes the first part of options A, B, and C potentially correct.",
          "Step 4: Recall the behavior of total (stagnation) properties across a normal shock. For an adiabatic process (no heat transfer) and no external work, the total enthalpy of the fluid remains constant across a shock. For an ideal gas, this implies that the total temperature ($T_0$) remains *constant* across the shock. (RAG Chunk 1, 2, 4)",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on standard theory. \n    *   A. static temperature increases (Correct), total temperature remains constant (Correct).\n    *   B. static temperature increases (Correct), total temperature increases (Incorrect by standard theory).\n    *   C. static temperature increases (Correct), total temperature decreases (Incorrect by standard theory).\n    *   D. static pressure increases (Correct), total temperature remains constant (Correct).",
          "Step 6: Address the discrepancy with the provided answer key. Based on standard compressible flow theory, total temperature remains constant across an ideal normal shock. Therefore, option B's assertion that total temperature increases is generally incorrect.
