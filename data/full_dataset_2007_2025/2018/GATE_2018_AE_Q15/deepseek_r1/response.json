        "reasoning": "The question asks what happens to the air when a shock wave moves into still air (a moving shock problem). For a normal shock (analyzed in a frame where the shock is stationary), static temperature ($T$) always increases. The key nuance is the behavior of total temperature ($T_0$). For a stationary normal shock in an adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas, $T_0$ remains constant. However, for a shock moving into still air, we analyze in the lab frame. The initially still air has zero velocity, so its lab-frame total temperature equals its static temperature ($T_{0,1} = T_1$). After the shock passes, the air is set into motion with a non-zero velocity $V_2$. Therefore, its lab-frame total temperature becomes $T_{0,2} = T_2 + V_2^2/(2C_p)$, which is greater than $T_1$ because $T_2 > T_1$ and $V_2^2/(2C_p) > 0$. Hence, both static and total temperature increase in the lab frame. Option B correctly states this. This distinction between shock-fixed and lab-frame total temperature is the critical concept tested."

          "Step 1: Understand the scenario. A shock wave is propagating into still air inside a shock tube. This is a 'moving shock' problem. The air ahead of the shock is stationary (still air).",
          "Step 2: Recall that the analysis of a moving shock is most conveniently performed by shifting to a reference frame where the shock is stationary. In this shock-fixed frame, the upstream air approaches the shock with a velocity equal to the shock speed ($V_s$). The flow through this stationary shock obeys normal shock relations.",
          "Step 3: Apply normal shock relations in the shock-fixed frame. Across a normal shock, static pressure, static temperature, and static density always increase. Therefore, the static temperature of the air increases ($T_2 > T_1$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze total temperature behavior. In the shock-fixed frame, the flow is adiabatic (no heat addition). For a calorically perfect gas, the total enthalpy and thus the total temperature ($T_0'$) in that frame remain constant across the shock ($T_{0,1}' = T_{0,2}'$). This is a fundamental result from the energy equation.",
          "Step 5: Translate back to the lab frame. The upstream air was initially still, so its lab-frame total temperature $T_{0,1}^{lab} = T_1$ (since velocity is zero). The downstream air has a lab-frame velocity $V_2$ (induced by the shock). Its lab-frame total temperature is $T_{0,2}^{lab} = T_2 + V_2^2/(2C_p)$. Using the energy equation from the shock-fixed frame, it can be shown that $T_{0,2}^{lab} = T_1 + (V_s V_2)/C_p$, which is greater than $T_1$. Hence, the lab-frame total temperature increases.",

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided fundamental information on normal shock property changes, including static temperature increase and total temperature constancy in the shock-fixed frame (Chunks 1-4). Chunk 6 provided a worked example of a moving shock, which is directly relevant. However, the RAG context did not explicitly discuss the key nuance of lab-frame vs. shock-fixed frame total temperature for a moving shock. Internal knowledge was used to bridge this gap and explain why option B is correct."
