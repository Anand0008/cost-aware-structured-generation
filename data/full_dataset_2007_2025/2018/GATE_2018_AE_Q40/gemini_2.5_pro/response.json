Finally, the power required is the product of Drag and velocity ($P = D \\times V$). Substituting the given values: $W = 400,000 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 3,924,000 \\text{ N}$. $D = 3,924,000 \\text{ N} / 15 = 261,600 \\text{ N}$. $P = 261,600 \\text{ N} \\times 240 \\text{ m/s} = 62,784,000 \\text{ W}$.
