        "reasoning": "The question describes a thermocouple mounted flush in an insulated flat surface in a supersonic laminar flow of air. This setup measures the adiabatic wall temperature ($T_{aw}$). \\n\\n1.  **Insulated Surface**: An insulated surface implies that there is no heat transfer to or from the wall, meaning the thermocouple measures the adiabatic wall temperature ($T_{aw}$). \\n2.  **Viscous Heating**: In a high-speed flow, due to viscous effects within the boundary layer, kinetic energy is converted into internal energy, causing the fluid temperature near the wall to rise. This means $T_{aw}$ will always be greater than the freestream static temperature ($T_{\\infty}$). \\n3.  **Recovery Factor (R)**: The relationship between $T_{aw}$, static temperature ($T_{\\infty}$), and total (stagnation) temperature ($T_t$) is defined by the recovery factor, $R = \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{\\infty}}{T_t - T_{\\infty}}$. \\n4.  **Prandtl Number (Pr) for Air**: For air, the Prandtl number (Pr) is approximately 0.72. \\n5.  **Recovery Factor for Laminar Flow**: For a laminar boundary layer, the recovery factor is approximately $R \\approx \\sqrt{Pr}$. Therefore, $R \\approx \\sqrt{0.72} \\approx 0.85$. \\n6.  **Comparison**: Since $R < 1$ for air in laminar flow, it implies that $T_{aw}$ will be less than $T_t$. If $R=1$, then $T_{aw} = T_t$. Since $R < 1$, $T_{aw}$ recovers only a fraction of the total temperature rise from static to total temperature. \\n7.  **Conclusion**: Combining these points, the measured temperature ($T_{aw}$) will be greater than the static temperature ($T_{\\infty}$) but less than the total temperature ($T_t$). This corresponds to option B."

          "Step 1: Identify the measurement scenario. The thermocouple is flush-mounted in an *insulated flat surface* in a *supersonic laminar flow of air*. This means the thermocouple measures the adiabatic wall temperature ($T_{aw}$).",
          "Step 2: Understand the concept of adiabatic wall temperature. Due to viscous dissipation within the boundary layer, the kinetic energy of the fluid is converted into internal energy, causing the temperature at the wall to rise above the freestream static temperature ($T_{\\infty}$). Thus, $T_{aw} > T_{\\infty}$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the definition of the recovery factor ($R$). The recovery factor relates the adiabatic wall temperature to the static and total temperatures: $R = \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{\\infty}}{T_t - T_{\\infty}}$.",
          "Step 4: Consider the fluid properties. The flow is air, for which the Prandtl number (Pr) is approximately 0.72.",
          "Step 5: Determine the recovery factor for laminar flow. For a laminar boundary layer, the recovery factor is approximately $R \\approx \\sqrt{Pr}$. Substituting the value for air, $R \\approx \\sqrt{0.72} \\approx 0.85$.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the relationship between $T_{aw}$ and $T_t$. Since $R < 1$ (specifically, $R \\approx 0.85$), it implies that $T_{aw}$ is less than $T_t$. If $R$ were 1, then $T_{aw}$ would equal $T_t$. \\nFrom $T_{aw} - T_{\\infty} = R(T_t - T_{\\infty})$, since $R < 1$ and $T_t > T_{\\infty}$, it follows that $T_{aw} < T_t$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude the range of the measured temperature. Based on Step 2 ($T_{aw} > T_{\\infty}$) and Step 6 ($T_{aw} < T_t$), the thermocouple measures a temperature greater than the static temperature but less than the total temperature."
