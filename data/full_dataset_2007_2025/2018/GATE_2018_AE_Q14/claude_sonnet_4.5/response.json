Based on the explanation in the retrieved knowledge, the temperature measured by the thermocouple in this scenario would be the adiabatic wall temperature (`T_aw`), which is greater than the static temperature (`T_∞`) but less than the total temperature (`T_t∞`). This is because the viscous effects within the boundary layer cause the temperature at the wall to be higher than the freestream static temperature, but the heat conduction away from the wall prevents it from reaching the total temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
