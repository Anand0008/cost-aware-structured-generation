In a supersonic laminar flow, the fluid decelerates within the boundary layer due to viscosity, converting kinetic energy into internal energy (viscous heating). The adiabatic wall temperature is given by T_aw = T_static + R*(T_total - T_static), where R is the recovery factor. For laminar boundary layer flow, R ≈ √(Pr) (Prandtl number). For air, Pr ≈ 0.72, so R ≈ 0.85. Thus, T_aw is greater than static temperature but less than total temperature."
