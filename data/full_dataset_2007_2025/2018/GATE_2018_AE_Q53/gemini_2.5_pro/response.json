For an axial compressor rotor with 50% degree of reaction and constant axial velocity, a key property is that the absolute flow angle at the rotor inlet ($\\alpha_1$) is equal to the relative flow angle at the rotor exit ($\\beta_2$). Given $\\alpha_1 = 22^\\circ$, we have $\\beta_2 = 22^\\circ$. The magnitude of the relative velocity at the rotor exit ($V_{r2}$) can then be calculated using the axial velocity ($V_f$) and $\\beta_2$ through the relation $V_{r2} = \\frac{V_f}{\\cos(\\beta_2)}$. Substituting the values yields $V_{r2} = \\frac{200}{\\cos(22^\\circ)} \\approx 215.71 \\text{ m/s}$, which falls within the acceptable range of 215.0 to 216.5."
