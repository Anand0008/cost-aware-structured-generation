Assuming constant axial velocity, we can use the velocity triangle relationships and the degree of reaction formula to solve for the relative velocity magnitude at the rotor exit.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the relative flow angle at the rotor inlet (β₂) using the given absolute flow angle (α₂ = 22 deg) and the 50% degree of reaction:\nR_D = 0.5 * (V_f / u) * (tan(β₂) + tan(β₃))\n0.5 = 0.5 * (V_f / u) * (tan(22°) + tan(β₃))\ntan(β₂) = tan(22°)\nβ₂ = 22°\n\nStep 2: Calculate the relative velocity magnitude at the rotor inlet (W₁) using the constant axial velocity (V_f = 200 m/s) and the inlet relative flow angle (β₂ = 22°):\nW₁ = V_f / cos(β₂) = 200 / cos(22°) = 215.0 m/s\n\nStep 3: Calculate the relative velocity magnitude at the rotor exit (W₂) using the degree of reaction formula:\nR_D = 0.5 * (V_f / u) * (tan(β₂) + tan(β₃))\n0.5 = 0.5 * (V_f / u) * (tan(22°) + tan(β₃))\ntan(β₃) = tan(22°)\nβ₃ = 22°\nW₂ = V_f / cos(β₃) = 200 / cos(22°) = 215.0 m/s\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the relative velocity at the rotor exit is 215.0 to 216.5 m/s, accurate to one decimal place."
