          "Step 3: Set R = 0.5 in the equation: 0.5 = 1 - (V_f/(2u)) (tan(α1) + tan(α2)). Rearranging gives (V_f/(2u)) (tan(α1) + tan(α2)) = 0.5, which simplifies to tan(α1) + tan(α2) = u/V_f. This is Equation (1).",
          "Step 4: Consider the outlet velocity triangle of the rotor. The relative velocity at exit, W2, has components: axial = V_f, tangential = u - V_w2, where V_w2 = V_f tan(α2) is the tangential component of absolute velocity. So, the tangential component of W2 is u - V_f tan(α2).",
          "Step 5: Substitute u from Equation (1): u = V_f (tan(α1) + tan(α2)). Then the tangential component of W2 becomes V_f (tan(α1) + tan(α2)) - V_f tan(α2) = V_f tan(α1).",
          "Step 6: The magnitude of W2 is therefore W2 = sqrt[(axial component)^2 + (tangential component)^2] = sqrt[V_f^2 + (V_f tan(α1))^2] = V_f * sqrt(1 + tan^2(α1)) = V_f / cos(α1).",
          "Step 7: Perform the numerical calculation: cos(22°) ≈ 0.927183854. Then W2 = 200 / 0.927183854 ≈ 215.707. Rounded to one decimal place: 215.7 m/s."

The absolute flow angle at the inlet of the rotor is 22 deg with reference to the axial direction. If the axial velocity is assumed to remain constant through the rotor, the magnitude of the relative velocity (in m/s) at the rotor exit is __________ (accurate to one decimal place)."
