However, the specific 50% reaction symmetry relation (\\(\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2\\)) and the direct formula for \\(W_2\\) were supplied mainly from internal knowledge rather than explicitly from the chunks."

The absolute flow angle at the inlet of the rotor is 22 deg with reference to the axial direction. If the axial velocity is assumed to remain constant through the rotor, the magnitude of the relative velocity (in m/s) at the rotor exit is __________ (accurate to one decimal place)."
