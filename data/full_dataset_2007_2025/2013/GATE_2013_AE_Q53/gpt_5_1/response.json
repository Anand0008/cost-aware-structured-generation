        "reasoning": "The official key awarded marks to all, indicating an ambiguity or error in the original statement. To still give students a learning path, we reconstruct a plausible consistent interpretation.\n\n1. For a single thin symmetric airfoil at small \\(\\alpha\\), thin airfoil theory gives \\(c_l = 2\\pi \\alpha\\) and \\(L' = \\rho U^2 c \\pi \\alpha\\). By Kutta\\textendash Joukowski, \\(L' = \\rho U \\Gamma\\), so the effective circulation associated with the airfoil is \\(\\Gamma = \\pi c U \\alpha\\).\n\n2. In Q52 (previous linked question), the problem says: \\\"If the circulation at the quarter chord (c/4) of the airfoil is \\(\\Gamma_1\\), the normal velocity is zero at ...\\\". For a single airfoil modeled by a bound vortex at its quarter chord, the only chordwise point where the induced normal velocity from that vortex cancels the free-stream normal component is the three-quarter-chord point (\\(3c/4\\)). So Q52 most likely intended the answer \\(3c/4\\). That condition fixes the relation between \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\alpha\\): for a single airfoil, we must have \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\pi c U \\alpha\\).\n\n3. In Q53, a second identical airfoil is placed downstream at a distance \\(c/2\\) from the trailing edge of the first. Each airfoil is modeled by a point vortex at its own quarter chord, with circulations \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\). The condition given is that the normal velocity becomes zero at the same chordwise locations of the respective airfoils as in Q52. Interpreting this in the simplest consistent way: each airfoil must still see zero normal velocity at its own 3/4-chord point (measured from its own leading edge). That means, at each airfoil, the sum of: (i) free-stream normal component, (ii) self-induced velocity from its own vortex, and (iii) induced velocity from the other airfoil\\'s vortex, must cancel.\n\n4. If we place the first airfoil leading edge at \\(x=0\\), its quarter chord is at \\(x=c/4\\), trailing edge at \\(x=c\\). The second airfoil is placed so that its leading edge is at \\(x = 1.5c\\) (since it is at a distance \\(c/2\\) behind the first trailing edge). Its quarter chord is at \\(x = 1.75c\\). The 3/4-chord point of the first airfoil is at \\(x=0.75c\\); that of the second is at \\(x = 2.25c\\).\n\n5. The induced vertical velocity at a point due to a 2D point vortex of strength \\(\\Gamma\\) located at horizontal distance \\(\\Delta x\\) on the same horizontal line is \\(v = \\Gamma / (2\\pi \\Delta x)\\) (sign depending on orientation). For small \\(\\alpha\\), the free-stream normal component is approximately \\(U \\alpha\\).\n\n6. For the first airfoil at its own 3/4-chord point, the self-induced velocity from its own vortex is the same as in the single-airfoil case that led to \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\pi c U \\alpha\\). The additional induced velocity from the second airfoil\\'s vortex is small because the second airfoil is far downstream (distance of order \\(\\sim 1.5c\\) or more). To preserve the same zero-normal-velocity location, the simplest consistent approximation is to require that \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) be equal so that the mutual induced effects are symmetric and do not shift the zero-normal-velocity points relative to each airfoil\\'s chord.\n\n7. Under this symmetry assumption, both airfoils must carry the same circulation, and that circulation must be reduced from the isolated-airfoil value \\(\\pi c U \\alpha\\) because each airfoil now experiences additional induced normal velocity from the other. A simple linear superposition argument (treating the mutual induction as effectively adding to the local \\(U\\alpha\\) that must be canceled) leads to a reduction factor of about \\(2/3\\), giving \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\tfrac{2}{3} \\pi c U \\alpha\\).\n\n8. Among the options, only option B has \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2\\) and both less than \\(\\pi c U \\alpha\\), which is physically reasonable for two identical, mutually interacting lifting elements. Options A and D imply unequal or too-large circulations; option C implies unequal circulations, breaking the symmetry of two identical airfoils at the same \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nBecause the official key gave \\\"marks to all\\\", the problem statement or geometry is likely incomplete or inconsistent, so any specific numeric factor (2/3 vs 4/3, etc.) is not uniquely derivable. However, from physical reasoning and symmetry, B is the most defensible choice, though with moderate confidence."

          "Step 2: From the previous linked question (single airfoil), the condition that normal velocity is zero at a specific chordwise point (most plausibly 3c/4) fixes the relation between \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) for an isolated airfoil: \\(\\Gamma_1^{(isolated)} = \\pi c U \\alpha\\).",
          "Step 3: Introduce the second identical airfoil downstream. Model each airfoil by a point vortex at its quarter chord, with circulations \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\). The requirement is that, for each airfoil, the normal velocity is zero at the same chordwise location (relative to its own chord) as in the isolated case.",
          "Step 4: At the critical point on each airfoil, the total normal velocity is the sum of: (i) free-stream normal component \\(U\\alpha\\), (ii) self-induced velocity from its own vortex, and (iii) induced velocity from the other airfoil's vortex. To preserve the same zero-normal-velocity location, the total must still cancel.",
          "Step 5: Because the airfoils are identical and at the same \\(\\alpha\\), physical symmetry suggests \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2\\). If one had larger circulation than the other, their zero-normal-velocity points would shift differently, violating the stated condition that each airfoil retains the same chordwise location as in the single-airfoil case.",
          "Step 6: Mutual induction effectively increases the normal velocity that must be canceled at each airfoil, so the required circulation on each airfoil must be smaller than the isolated-airfoil value \\(\\pi c U \\alpha\\). Among the options, only option B has equal circulations on both airfoils and values less than \\(\\pi c U \\alpha\\): \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\tfrac{2}{3} \\pi c U \\alpha\\).",
          "Step 7: Therefore, under a reasonable symmetric-interaction interpretation, the best choice is option B, even though the official exam awarded full marks to all options due to ambiguity."
