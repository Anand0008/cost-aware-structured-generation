Using the boundary condition that the total normal velocity (freestream + induced) is zero at the three-quarter chord point of each airfoil (the standard collocation point from the linked Q52 context), we derive two linear equations. Solving yields Γ₁ = (4/3)πcUα and Γ₂ = (2/3)πcUα, matching option A. The official answer key states 'Marks to All', which may indicate ambiguity or errors in the original exam, but our theoretical derivation points to A as the physically correct answer."

          "Step 1: Understand the setup. Two identical thin symmetric airfoils are placed in tandem along the same chord line. The first airfoil has circulation Γ₁ at its quarter-chord (c/4). The second airfoil, placed a distance c/2 behind the trailing edge of the first, has circulation Γ₂ at its quarter-chord. The chord length is c, freestream velocity U, angle of attack α.",
          "Step 2: Establish coordinates. Place the leading edge of the first airfoil at x=0. Then its quarter-chord is at x₁ = c/4, trailing edge at x=c. The second airfoil's leading edge is at x = c + c/2 = 3c/2, so its quarter-chord is at x₂ = 3c/2 + c/4 = 7c/4.",
          "Step 3: Identify collocation points. From linked Q52 context (standard thin airfoil theory for a single vortex representation), the normal velocity is zero at the three-quarter chord point to satisfy the Kutta condition. Thus, for airfoil 1, collocation point is at x_{c1} = 3c/4. For airfoil 2, it is at x_{c2} = (3c/2) + (3c/4) = 9c/4.",
          "Step 4: Apply boundary condition at each collocation point. The total normal velocity (upward positive) must be zero: Uα (from freestream) + sum of induced velocities from both vortices = 0. The induced upward velocity w at point x due to a vortex of strength Γ at x_v is w = Γ/(2π (x_v - x)).",
          "Step 5: Write equations. For airfoil 1 at x_{c1}: Uα + Γ₁/(2π (x₁ - x_{c1})) + Γ₂/(2π (x₂ - x_{c1})) = 0. Compute distances: x₁ - x_{c1} = c/4 - 3c/4 = -c/2, x₂ - x_{c1} = 7c/4 - 3c/4 = c. So: Uα - Γ₁/(πc) + Γ₂/(2πc) = 0. (Equation 1)",
          "Step 6: For airfoil 2 at x_{c2}: Uα + Γ₁/(2π (x₁ - x_{c2})) + Γ₂/(2π (x₂ - x_{c2})) = 0. Distances: x₁ - x_{c2} = c/4 - 9c/4 = -2c, x₂ - x_{c2} = 7c/4 - 9c/4 = -c/2. So: Uα - Γ₁/(4πc) - Γ₂/(πc) = 0. (Equation 2)",
          "Step 7: Solve the system. From Eq1: Uα = (2Γ₁ - Γ₂)/(2πc). From Eq2: Uα = (Γ₁ + 4Γ₂)/(4πc). Equate: (2Γ₁ - Γ₂)/2 = (Γ₁ + 4Γ₂)/4 => 4Γ₁ - 2Γ₂ = Γ₁ + 4Γ₂ => 3Γ₁ = 6Γ₂ => Γ₁ = 2Γ₂. Substitute into Eq1: Uα = (4Γ₂ - Γ₂)/(2πc) = 3Γ₂/(2πc) => Γ₂ = (2πc Uα)/3. Then Γ₁ = (4πc Uα)/3."

Therefore, the solution relied primarily on internal knowledge of aerodynamics principles (superposition, induced velocity, collocation point method)."
