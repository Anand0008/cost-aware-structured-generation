        "reasoning": "The question provides the key information that the first airfoil has a circulation of Γ₁ at its quarter-chord, and the second airfoil has an unknown circulation Γ₂ at its quarter-chord. The Kutta condition requires that the normal velocity be zero at the same chord-wise locations for both airfoils, as stated in the previous question.\n\nTo satisfy the Kutta condition, the circulation values must be related such that the net circulation around the two airfoils is zero. This can be achieved by having Γ₁ = 4/3 πcUα and Γ₂ = 2/3 πcUα, as given in option A. This ensures that the normal velocity is zero at the quarter-chord of both airfoils, as required by the Kutta condition."
