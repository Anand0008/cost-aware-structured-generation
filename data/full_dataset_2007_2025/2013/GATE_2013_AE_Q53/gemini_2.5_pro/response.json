        "reasoning": "1.  **Circulation for a single thin symmetric airfoil ($\\Gamma_1$):** According to thin airfoil theory (supported by RAG Chunks 3 and 5), the lift coefficient for a thin symmetric airfoil at an angle of attack $\\alpha$ in incompressible, inviscid flow is $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha$. The lift per unit span $L'$ is given by $L' = q_\\infty c c_l = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho U^2 c (2\\pi\\alpha) = \\pi \\rho U^2 c \\alpha$. By the Kutta-Joukowski theorem (RAG Chunk 5), $L' = \\rho U \\Gamma_1$. Equating these two expressions for lift, we get $\\rho U \\Gamma_1 = \\pi \\rho U^2 c \\alpha$, which simplifies to $\\Gamma_1 = \\pi c U \\alpha$. \n2.  **Comparison with Options:** None of the provided options for $\\Gamma_1$ (A: $4/3 \\pi c U \\alpha$, B: $2/3 \\pi c U \\alpha$, C: $2/3 \\pi c U \\alpha$, D: $4/3 \\pi c U \\alpha$) match the standard theoretical result of $\\pi c U \\alpha$. This indicates a fundamental discrepancy in the question's options or premise. \n3.  **Effect of the second airfoil ($\\Gamma_2$):** When a second identical airfoil is placed behind the first, it is situated in the wake of the leading airfoil. The circulation generated by the first airfoil creates a trailing vortex system (downwash field). This downwash reduces the effective angle of attack experienced by the second airfoil. Consequently, the circulation generated by the second airfoil, $\\Gamma_2$, should be *less than* $\\Gamma_1$. \n4.  **Evaluating Options based on relationship:** Options B and D suggest $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1$, which is physically incorrect due to induced effects. Options A and C suggest $\\Gamma_2 < \\Gamma_1$, which is qualitatively correct. Both A and C imply $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1 / 2$. However, without a specific multi-element airfoil theory or induced drag model, this exact ratio cannot be confirmed from the given information. \n5.  **Conclusion:** Due to the inconsistency of the numerical factors in the options with standard thin airfoil theory for $\\Gamma_1$, and the lack of sufficient information to derive a precise relationship for $\\Gamma_2$ beyond a qualitative reduction, the question is flawed. Therefore, the 'Marks to All' decision by GATE is justified."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall the fundamental results from Thin Airfoil Theory. For a thin symmetric airfoil at an angle of attack $\\alpha$ in an incompressible, inviscid flow, the lift coefficient $c_l$ is given by $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha$.",
          "Step 2: Apply the Kutta-Joukowski Theorem. The lift per unit span $L'$ is related to the circulation $\\Gamma$ by $L' = \\rho U \\Gamma$. The lift can also be expressed as $L' = q_\\infty c c_l = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho U^2 c c_l$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the circulation for the first airfoil ($\\Gamma_1$). Substitute $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha$ into the lift equation: $L' = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho U^2 c (2\\pi\\alpha) = \\pi \\rho U^2 c \\alpha$. Equating this with the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, $\\rho U \\Gamma_1 = \\pi \\rho U^2 c \\alpha$. Solving for $\\Gamma_1$ yields the standard result: $\\Gamma_1 = \\pi c U \\alpha$.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the given options for $\\Gamma_1$. Compare the derived $\\Gamma_1 = \\pi c U \\alpha$ with the values provided in the options. It is observed that none of the options (which contain factors of $2/3$ or $4/3$) match this standard theoretical result. This indicates a potential flaw in the question's numerical values.",
          "Step 5: Consider the aerodynamic interaction for the second airfoil ($\\Gamma_2$). The second identical airfoil is placed behind the first one. The first airfoil, generating lift, creates a trailing vortex system (wake) that induces a downwash velocity field. This downwash affects the flow over the second airfoil.",
          "Step 6: Determine the qualitative relationship for $\\Gamma_2$. The induced downwash reduces the effective angle of attack experienced by the second airfoil. Since circulation is directly proportional to the effective angle of attack, the circulation generated by the second airfoil, $\\Gamma_2$, must be less than $\\Gamma_1$.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate the options based on this qualitative relationship. Options B and D suggest $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1$, which contradicts the physical reality of induced effects. Options A and C suggest $\\Gamma_2 < \\Gamma_1$, which is qualitatively correct. Both A and C imply $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1 / 2$. However, without a specific multi-element airfoil theory or induced drag model, this exact ratio cannot be rigorously derived from the given information.",
          "Step 8: Conclude on the question's validity. Due to the discrepancy between the standard theoretical value of $\\Gamma_1$ and the options, and the lack of sufficient information to precisely determine $\\Gamma_2$, the question is considered flawed. This justifies the 'Marks to All' decision by GATE."
