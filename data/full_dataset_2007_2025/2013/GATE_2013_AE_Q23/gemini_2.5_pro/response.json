        "reasoning": "The question asks to compare Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) based on two criteria: $\\Delta V$ requirement for launch and altitude. \\n\\n1.  **Altitude Comparison:**\\n    *   According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 4), Low Earth Orbit (LEO) typically ranges from approximately 200 km to 2000 km above Earth's surface. \\n    *   According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 5, 6), Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) has an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above Earth's surface. \\n    *   Therefore, the altitude of LEO is significantly lower than that of GSO. This eliminates options C and D.\\n\\n2.  **$\\Delta V$ Requirement Comparison:**\\n    *   $\\Delta V$ (change in velocity) represents the total propulsive effort required for a mission (Chunk 1). To reach a higher orbit, more energy must be imparted to the spacecraft to increase its potential and kinetic energy. \\n    *   Launching a satellite to a higher orbit like GSO (35,786 km altitude) requires substantially more energy and thus a greater total $\\Delta V$ than launching it to a much lower orbit like LEO (200-2000 km altitude). This is a fundamental principle of orbital mechanics; higher orbits are 'harder' to reach. For example, a Hohmann transfer to GEO from LEO requires significant $\\Delta V$ (Chunk 1, 3). Launching directly to GSO from Earth's surface would inherently require more $\\Delta V$ than launching to LEO. \\n    *   Therefore, the $\\Delta V$ requirement for launch to LEO is lower than that for GSO. This eliminates option A.\\n\\nCombining these two points, option B states that '$\\Delta V$ requirement for launch to LEO is lower than that for GSO, and altitude of LEO is lower than that of GSO', which is consistent with the principles of orbital mechanics and the provided definitions."

          "Step 4: Compare the $\\Delta V$ requirements for launching to LEO versus GSO. Reaching a higher orbit (GSO) requires overcoming a greater gravitational potential and achieving a higher total energy state compared to a lower orbit (LEO). This implies that the $\\Delta V$ required to reach GSO from Earth's surface is significantly greater than that required to reach LEO.",
