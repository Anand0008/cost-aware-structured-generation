        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the minimum and maximum speeds of an airplane in level flight at sea-level. \n\n**1. Minimum Speed (Stall Speed):**\nIn steady, unaccelerated level flight, the lift ($L$) must equal the weight ($W$). The minimum speed an aircraft can fly at is its stall speed ($V_{stall}$), which occurs when the lift coefficient ($C_L$) reaches its maximum value ($C_{Lmax}$). The lift equation is:\n$L = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_L$\nFor level flight, $L = W$. So, $W = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V_{stall}^2 S C_{Lmax}$.\nRearranging for $V_{stall}$:\n$V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty S C_{Lmax}}}$\nGiven:\n$W = 30 \\text{ kN} = 30000 \\text{ N}$\n$\\rho_\\infty = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$S = 30 \\text{ m}^2$\n$C_{Lmax} = 1.4$\nSubstituting these values:\n$V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 30000}{1.22 \\times 30 \\times 1.4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{60000}{51.24}} \\approx \\sqrt{1170.96} \\approx 34.22 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**2. Maximum Speed:**\nFor maximum speed in level flight, the thrust available ($T_0$) must equal the drag ($D$).\n$T_0 = D$\nThe drag equation is:\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_D$\nThe drag coefficient is given by the drag polar: $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, where $C_{D0} = 0.015$ and $K = 0.024$.\nIn level flight, $L = W$, so we can express $C_L$ in terms of $V$:\n$C_L = \\frac{W}{0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty V^2 S}$\nSubstitute $C_L$ into the drag polar:\n$C_D = C_{D0} + K \\left(\\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty V^2 S}\\right)^2 = C_{D0} + \\frac{4 K W^2}{(\\rho_\\infty S)^2 V^4}$\nNow substitute this $C_D$ into the drag equation:\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S \\left(C_{D0} + \\frac{4 K W^2}{(\\rho_\\infty S)^2 V^4}\\right)$\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0} V^2 + \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S V^2}$\nSet $T_0 = D$:\n$T_0 = (0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0}) V^2 + \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S V^2}$\nLet's calculate the coefficients:\n$A = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0} = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times 30 \\times 0.015 = 0.2745$\n$B = \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.024 \\times (30000)^2}{1.22 \\times 30} = \\frac{0.048 \\times 900,000,000}{36.6} \\approx 1,180,327.87$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$4000 = 0.2745 V^2 + \\frac{1,180,327.87}{V^2}$\nMultiply by $V^2$ to get a quadratic equation in $V^2$ (let $X = V^2$):\n$0.2745 (V^2)^2 - 4000 (V^2) + 1,180,327.87 = 0$\n$0.2745 X^2 - 4000 X + 1,180,327.87 = 0$\nUsing the quadratic formula $X = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4000)^2 - 4 \\times 0.2745 \\times 1,180,327.87}}{2 \\times 0.2745}$\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{16,000,000 - 1,296,000.003}}{0.549}$\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{14,703,999.997}}{0.549} \\approx \\frac{4000 \\pm 3834.58}{0.549}$\nTwo solutions for $X = V^2$:\n$X_1 = \\frac{4000 + 3834.58}{0.549} = \\frac{7834.58}{0.549} \\approx 14270.64 \\text{ m}^2/s^2$\n$V_{max} = \\sqrt{14270.64} \\approx 119.46 \\text{ m/s}$\n$X_2 = \\frac{4000 - 3834.58}{0.549} = \\frac{165.42}{0.549} \\approx 301.31 \\text{ m}^2/s^2$\n$V_{min, T=D} = \\sqrt{301.31} \\approx 17.36 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**3. Final Minimum and Maximum Speeds:**\nThe minimum speed for level flight is the higher of the stall speed ($V_{stall}$) and the lower speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equation ($V_{min, T=D}$). This is because an aircraft cannot fly below its stall speed, even if it has enough thrust.\nMinimum speed = $\\max(V_{stall}, V_{min, T=D}) = \\max(34.22 \\text{ m/s}, 17.36 \\text{ m/s}) = 34.22 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThe maximum speed is the higher speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equation:\nMaximum speed = $119.46 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nThus, the minimum and maximum speeds are $34.22 \\text{ m/s}$ and $119.46 \\text{ m/s}$ respectively, which corresponds to Option C."

          "Step 2: Calculate the stall speed ($V_{stall}$). In level flight, lift equals weight ($L=W$). Using the lift equation $L = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_L$, substitute $L=W$ and $C_L=C_{Lmax}$ to solve for $V_{stall}$.",
          "Step 3: Set up the equation for maximum speed. For maximum speed, thrust available ($T_0$) must equal drag ($D$). Express drag using the drag equation $D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_D$ and the given drag polar $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the lift coefficient ($C_L$) in terms of velocity ($V$) into the drag polar. Since $L=W$ in level flight, $C_L = \\frac{W}{0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S}$. This will express $C_D$ solely as a function of $V$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the expression for $C_D(V)$ into the drag equation to get $D(V)$. Then, set $T_0 = D(V)$. This will result in a quartic equation in $V$, which can be simplified into a quadratic equation in $V^2$.",
          "Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation for $V^2$ to find two possible values for $V^2$. Take the square root of these values to find two velocities. These represent the speeds where thrust available equals drag.",
          "Step 7: Determine the final minimum and maximum speeds. The actual minimum speed for level flight is the higher value between the calculated stall speed and the lower speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equilibrium. The maximum speed is the higher speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equilibrium.",
