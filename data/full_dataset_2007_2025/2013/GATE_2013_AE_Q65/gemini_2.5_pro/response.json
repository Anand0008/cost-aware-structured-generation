Since we have identified at least one individual (X) who is both a scientist and a researcher, it means that the set of scientists and the set of researchers have a non-empty intersection. This can be stated as \"Some scientists are researchers\" or, equivalently, \"Some researchers are scientists.\" Comparing this with the given options, option C (\"Some researchers are scientists\") is the correct and logically valid inference."
