        "reasoning": "In the context of inviscid flow over a solid body, such as a thin airfoil, a fundamental kinematic boundary condition must be satisfied: the flow cannot penetrate the surface of the body. This means that the velocity component normal (perpendicular) to the airfoil's surface must be zero at every point on that surface. For a thin airfoil, especially in thin airfoil theory, the chord line is considered to represent the airfoil's surface for the purpose of applying these boundary conditions. Therefore, the normal velocity is zero at all points on the chord. The mention of circulation $\\Gamma_1$ at the quarter chord (c/4) is relevant to the generation of lift and the modeling of the airfoil in thin airfoil theory, but it does not alter this fundamental kinematic boundary condition that applies to the entire surface. While the official GATE answer key indicates 'Marks to All', suggesting potential ambiguity or a bonus question, option D is the most scientifically accurate and comprehensive response based on the principles of fluid mechanics."
