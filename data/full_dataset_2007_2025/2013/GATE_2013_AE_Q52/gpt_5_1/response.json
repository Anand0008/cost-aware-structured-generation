        "reasoning": "The official key states 'Marks to All', meaning the question was judged ambiguous or flawed. Conceptually, for a thin symmetric airfoil in potential flow, the Kutta–Joukowski model with a bound vortex at c/4 is a mathematical representation; the physical boundary condition is zero normal velocity at all points on the airfoil surface (no-penetration). However, in classical thin-airfoil theory, the bound vortex is not literally located at c/4; instead, a continuous vortex sheet is used, and the quarter-chord emerges as the aerodynamic center. The wording 'If the circulation at the quarter chord (c/4) of the airfoil is \\Gamma_1, the normal velocity is zero at' is ambiguous: it mixes the idea of a single bound vortex at c/4 (which would not satisfy zero normal velocity everywhere) with the thin-airfoil solution (which enforces zero normal velocity along the chord). Different reasonable interpretations could lead to different options (e.g., D: all points on the chord, or A: c/4). Because of this ambiguity, GATE awarded marks to all, and that is treated as correct by definition."

          "Step 1: Recall that in inviscid, incompressible, irrotational flow over a thin airfoil, lift is modeled via circulation around the airfoil, related to lift per unit span by $L' = \\rho U \\Gamma$.",
          "Step 2: In thin airfoil theory, the airfoil is replaced by its camber line (for symmetric airfoil, the chord line) and a vortex sheet of varying strength is distributed along the chord. The strength distribution is chosen so that the normal component of velocity on the chord is zero (no-penetration condition).",
          "Step 3: The total circulation is the integral of this vortex sheet and, for a symmetric thin airfoil, the aerodynamic center is at the quarter-chord, where the moment is nearly constant with angle of attack.",
          "Step 4: The question, however, states 'If the circulation at the quarter chord (c/4) of the airfoil is $\\Gamma_1$' as if there is a single bound vortex located at c/4. A single point vortex at c/4 in a uniform flow will not, by itself, make the normal velocity zero at all points on the chord; it only satisfies the Kutta–Joukowski lift relation globally.",
          "Step 5: If one interprets the statement as the standard thin-airfoil model (continuous vortex sheet whose net circulation is effectively associated with the quarter-chord aerodynamic center), then the correct physical boundary condition is zero normal velocity at every point along the chord, suggesting option D.",
          "Step 6: Because the wording mixes the idea of a discrete vortex at c/4 with the continuous distribution, and does not clearly specify which model is intended, more than one interpretation is defensible. This ambiguity is why the official solution awarded marks to all candidates."

Some reasoning about ambiguity and exam policy relied on internal knowledge."
