        "reasoning": "For Q to be orthonormal, its columns (or rows) must be orthonormal: each of unit norm and mutually orthogonal. Let the columns be q_1, q_2, q_3.\nq_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{bmatrix}, q_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\0\\\\-1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{bmatrix}, q_3 = \\begin{bmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\c\\end{bmatrix}.\n1) Norms of q_1 and q_2:\n\\|q_1\\|^2 = 3\\times (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1, \\|q_2\\|^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + 0^2 + (-1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1. So first two columns are already unit vectors.\n2) Orthogonality of q_1 and q_2:\nq_1^T q_2 = (1/\\sqrt{3})(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (1/\\sqrt{3})0 + (1/\\sqrt{3})(-1/\\sqrt{2}) = 0, so they are orthogonal.\n3) Orthogonality of q_3 with q_1 and q_2:\nq_1^T q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{3})(a + b + c) = 0 \\Rightarrow a + b + c = 0.\nq_2^T q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{2})a + 0\\cdot b + (-1/\\sqrt{2})c = 0 \\Rightarrow a - c = 0 \\Rightarrow a = c.\nSubstitute a = c into a + b + c = 0: 2a + b = 0 \\Rightarrow b = -2a.\n4) Unit norm of q_3:\n\\|q_3\\|^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + (-2a)^2 + a^2 = 6a^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 1/6 \\Rightarrow a = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{6}.\nThen c = a and b = -2a. So two possible triples:\n(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6}) or (a, b, c) = (-1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6}).\nComparing with options, these correspond to options B and D, but note the signs: Option B has (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6}) and option D has (1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6}).\nCheck orthogonality with q_1 for each:\nFor option B: a + b + c = 1/\\sqrt{6} - 2/\\sqrt{6} + 1/\\sqrt{6} = 0 (OK), and a - c = 0 (OK). Norm: 1/6 + 4/6 + 1/6 = 1 (OK). So B gives an orthonormal Q.\nFor option D: a + b + c = 1/\\sqrt{6} + 2/\\sqrt{6} - 1/\\sqrt{6} = 2/\\sqrt{6} \\neq 0, so q_1^T q_3 \\neq 0 and columns are not orthogonal.\nThus mathematically option B is the correct orthonormal completion. However, the official key states D. By instruction, we must mark the key as correct but note that the derivation clearly supports option B as the true orthonormal set; the key appears to have a sign error."
