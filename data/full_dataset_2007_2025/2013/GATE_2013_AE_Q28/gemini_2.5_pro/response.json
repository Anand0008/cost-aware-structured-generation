        "reasoning": "The problem requires finding values of `a`, `b`, and `c` such that the given matrix `Q` is orthonormal. An orthonormal matrix (or orthogonal matrix for real entries) has column vectors that form an orthonormal set. This means each column vector must have a norm of 1, and any two distinct column vectors must be orthogonal (their dot product is 0).\n\nLet the column vectors of `Q` be $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$:\n$q_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{3} \\ 1/\\sqrt{3} \\ 1/\\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix}$, $q_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}$, $q_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n1.  **Check existing column vectors:**\n    *   Norm of $q_1$: $||q_1||^2 = (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Norm of $q_2$: $||q_2||^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + 0^2 + (-1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Orthogonality of $q_1$ and $q_2$: $q_1 \\cdot q_2 = (1/\\sqrt{3})(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (1/\\sqrt{3})(0) + (1/\\sqrt{3})(-1/\\sqrt{2}) = 1/\\sqrt{6} - 1/\\sqrt{6} = 0$. (Satisfied)\n\n2.  **Apply orthonormality conditions for $q_3$:**\n    *   **Unit norm for $q_3$**: $||q_3||^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ (Equation 1)\n    *   **Orthogonality of $q_1$ and $q_3$**: $q_1 \\cdot q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{3})a + (1/\\sqrt{3})b + (1/\\sqrt{3})c = 0$. Multiplying by $\\sqrt{3}$ gives $a + b + c = 0$ (Equation 2)\n    *   **Orthogonality of $q_2$ and $q_3$**: $q_2 \\cdot q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{2})a + (0)b + (-1/\\sqrt{2})c = 0$. Multiplying by $\\sqrt{2}$ gives $a - c = 0 \\implies a = c$ (Equation 3)\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    *   From Equation 3, substitute $c=a$ into Equation 2: $a + b + a = 0 \\implies 2a + b = 0 \\implies b = -2a$.\n    *   Substitute $c=a$ and $b=-2a$ into Equation 1: $a^2 + (-2a)^2 + a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = 1 \\implies 6a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 = 1/6$.\n    *   Therefore, $a = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n4.  **Determine $(a, b, c)$ values:**\n    *   **Case 1:** If $a = 1/\\sqrt{6}$:\n        $c = a = 1/\\sqrt{6}$\n        $b = -2a = -2/\\sqrt{6}$\n        So, $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6})$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n    *   **Case 2:** If $a = -1/\\sqrt{6}$:\n        $c = a = -1/\\sqrt{6}$\n        $b = -2a = -2(-1/\\sqrt{6}) = 2/\\sqrt{6}$\n        So, $(a, b, c) = (-1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$. This is not directly listed as an option.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Discrepancy with Answer Key:**\n    Based on the mathematical derivation, the values $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6})$ (Option B) correctly render the matrix `Q` orthonormal.\n    Let's check the provided answer key, Option D: $(1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$.\n    If $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$:\n    *   $a+b+c = 1/\\sqrt{6} + 2/\\sqrt{6} - 1/\\sqrt{6} = 2/\\sqrt{6} \\neq 0$. This violates Equation 2 ($a+b+c=0$).\n    *   $a-c = 1/\\sqrt{6} - (-1/\\sqrt{6}) = 2/\\sqrt{6} \\neq 0$. This violates Equation 3 ($a=c$).\n    Therefore, Option D does not satisfy the conditions for an orthonormal matrix. There appears to be a discrepancy between the derived correct answer (Option B) and the provided answer key (Option D). Following the instructions, the answer key 'D' is marked as correct, but the detailed derivation shows 'B' is the mathematically sound solution."

          "Step 1: Understand the definition of an orthonormal matrix. An orthonormal matrix (for real entries, also called an orthogonal matrix) is a square matrix whose column vectors (or row vectors) form an orthonormal basis. This implies two conditions: each column vector must have a unit norm (magnitude of 1), and any two distinct column vectors must be orthogonal (their dot product is 0).",
          "Step 2: Identify the three column vectors of the given matrix Q. Let them be $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$. The first two columns are fully specified, and the third column contains the unknowns $a, b, c$.",
          "Step 3: Verify that the given columns $q_1$ and $q_2$ are already orthonormal (unit norm and orthogonal to each other). This confirms the problem setup is consistent.",
          "Step 4: Apply the orthonormality conditions to the third column vector $q_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \\end{pmatrix}$. This involves setting its norm to 1 ($a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$) and its dot product with $q_1$ and $q_2$ to 0 ($q_1 \\cdot q_3 = 0$ and $q_2 \\cdot q_3 = 0$).",
          "Step 5: Formulate a system of linear and quadratic equations from these conditions. The dot product conditions will yield linear equations, and the norm condition will yield a quadratic equation.",
