Therefore entropy does NOT increase; it remains constant. So the statement that entropy can increase (Option B) is NOT true.\n- Over a gradual compression (concave, smooth turn), the flow can be compressed isentropically (Prandtl–Meyer compression) if the turn is sufficiently gradual, so entropy can remain constant (Option C is true).\n- Over a sharp compression corner (concave, sharp), an oblique shock forms, which is non-isentropic and always increases entropy (Option D is true).\nThus, the only incorrect statement is B, matching the official key."
