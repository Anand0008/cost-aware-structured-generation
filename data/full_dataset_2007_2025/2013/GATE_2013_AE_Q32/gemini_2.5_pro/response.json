A common approximation for $C_{l\\beta}$ due to dihedral for a rectangular wing, especially when aspect ratio is not provided, is given by the formula: $$C_{l\\beta} = -\\frac{c_{l\\alpha}}{4} \\Gamma$$ First, convert the dihedral angle from degrees to radians: $\\Gamma = 10^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{18} \\text{ rad} \\approx 0.17453 \\text{ rad}$. Given $c_{l\\alpha} = 5.4 / \\text{rad}$. Substitute these values into the formula: $$C_{l\\beta} = -\\frac{5.4}{4} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{18} = -1.35 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{18} = -0.075 \\pi$$ Calculating the numerical value: $C_{l\\beta} \\approx -0.075 \\times 3.14159265 \\approx -0.2356$. This value falls within the specified range of -0.23 to -0.24. The negative sign is consistent with the principle that dihedral provides positive lateral stability (a positive sideslip angle creates a negative, or restoring, rolling moment), as discussed in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 5 and 6)."
