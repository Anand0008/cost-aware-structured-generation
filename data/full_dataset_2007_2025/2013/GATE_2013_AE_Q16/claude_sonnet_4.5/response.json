Based on the principles of torsion for non-circular sections, the correct answer is that point A does not move horizontally, vertically, or axially. This is because the cross-section of a thin-walled member experiences warping deformation under torsion, where the plane sections do not remain plane. The out-of-plane displacement, or warping, causes points in the cross-section to move both axially and circumferentially, but not in the horizontal or vertical directions. Therefore, the correct answer is option C."
