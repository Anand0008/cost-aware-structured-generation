The cross-section appears to be an L-shaped open thin-walled section (a vertical and a horizontal leg meeting at point A). Under pure St. Venant torsion of an open thin-walled section, cross-sections warp: points move axially by an amount depending on their location, and also move in-plane due to twist. However, without specifying the axis of twist (shear centre vs. centroid), constraints at the ends, or whether warping is restrained, the exact displacement components (horizontal, vertical, axial) of point A cannot be uniquely determined. Different reasonable assumptions lead to different answers: \n- If twisted about the shear centre with free warping, A will have axial displacement and in-plane motion.\n- If twisted about a particular axis with warping fully restrained, additional bending-type displacements occur.\nBecause the problem does not define these essential conditions, more than one option can be argued, so the question is defective. Hence GATE correctly gave marks to all."
