        "reasoning": "The official answer key indicates 'Marks to All', meaning all options were accepted, likely due to ambiguity in the question or image. Based on standard theory: For a thin-walled open section (like a vertical line) under pure (St. Venant) torsion, the cross-section rotates rigidly about the shear center (which lies on the line) and warps out-of-plane. A point on the line (x=0) has coordinates (0, y_A) relative to the shear center. For small rotation θ, in-plane displacements: u = -θ y_A (horizontal), v = θ * 0 = 0 (vertical). Warping displacement w is zero along the midline of a thin strip. Thus, point A moves horizontally but not vertically or axially, corresponding to option D. However, if point A coincides with the shear center (y_A=0), then it does not move at all (option C). The image does not specify the location of A relative to the shear center, creating ambiguity. Hence, the official answer of 'Marks to All' is understandable."

          "Step 3: Determine in-plane displacements. Let the line be along the y-axis (vertical). Shear center at centroid (on the line). Point A has coordinates (0, y_A). Under twist, cross-section rotates by angle θ (function of axial coordinate z). For small θ, displacements: u = -θ y_A (horizontal), v = θ * x_A = 0 (since x_A=0). So, point A moves horizontally if y_A ≠ 0, and not vertically.",
          "Step 4: Determine axial (warping) displacement. For a thin rectangular strip, warping displacement w is zero along the midline (centerline) due to symmetry. Since the cross-section is a line (midline), w = 0 at all points on the line. Thus, no axial movement.",
