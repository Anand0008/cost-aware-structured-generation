        "reasoning": "For a long thin-walled open section (like the L-section shown in the figure) subjected to pure twist, the cross-section undergoes both in-plane rotation and out-of-plane warping.\n\n1.  **In-plane rotation:** The entire cross-section rotates about its shear center. For an L-section, the shear center is typically located at the intersection of the centerlines of the two legs, which is outside the material. Since point A is a corner point and not the shear center, it will experience tangential displacement components. This means point A will move both horizontally and vertically within the plane of the cross-section.\n2.  **Out-of-plane warping:** A fundamental characteristic of torsion in non-circular and especially open thin-walled sections is that plane sections do not remain plane; they warp. This warping involves axial (out-of-plane) displacement of points on the cross-section. Therefore, point A will also move axially.\n\nCombining these effects, point A will move horizontally, vertically, and axially. None of the provided options (A, B, C, D) correctly describe this combined motion, as each option either incorrectly negates one or more types of movement or negates all movements. Therefore, the 'Marks to All' designation is consistent with the physical behavior of such a section under pure twist."

Unlike circular shafts where plane sections remain plane, non-circular sections (especially open ones) experience *warping* in addition to rotation when subjected to pure twist (as highlighted in RAG chunks 2, 5, and 6).",
          "Step 3: Define warping. Warping is the out-of-plane (axial) displacement of points on the cross-section. This means that the cross-section does not remain flat but distorts axially along the length of the member (RAG chunk 5). Therefore, point A will experience axial movement.",
          "Step 4: Consider the in-plane motion due to rotation. The cross-section rotates about its shear center. For an L-section, the shear center is typically located at the intersection of the centerlines of the two legs, which is outside the material of the section.",
          "Step 5: Determine the motion of point A. Since point A is a corner point on the cross-section and not the shear center, it will undergo tangential displacement due to this rotation. This tangential displacement will have components in both the horizontal and vertical directions within the plane of the cross-section.",
          "Step 6: Synthesize the movements and evaluate the options. Based on the analysis, point A will move horizontally, vertically, and axially. None of the given options correctly describe this combined motion. Options A, B, and D incorrectly state that there is no axial movement or no vertical/horizontal movement. Option C incorrectly states no movement in any direction. This explains why the answer key is 'Marks to All'."
