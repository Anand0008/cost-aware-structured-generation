        "notes": "RAG chunks 1 and 4 were highly relevant, providing examples and derivations for functions that are continuous but not differentiable, or where derivatives do not exist due to one-sided limits not matching. This directly supports the analysis of $y=|x|$. Chunks 2, 3, 5, and 6 provided broader context on differentiability, continuity, and function spaces, reinforcing the underlying mathematical principles. The RAG content was comprehensive and helpful."
