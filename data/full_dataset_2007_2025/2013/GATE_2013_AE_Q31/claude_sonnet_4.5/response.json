This is because to achieve the minimum turn radius and maximum turn rate in a level turn, the aircraft must operate at the highest possible load factor (n_max) and the lowest possible velocity (V_min). \n\nFrom the turn radius formula, R = V^2 / (g√(n^2 - 1)), we can see that to minimize R, we need to maximize n and minimize V. Similarly, the turn rate formula, ω = (g√(n^2 - 1)) / V, shows that to maximize ω, we need to maximize n and minimize V.\n\nThe highest possible load factor (n_max) corresponds to the aircraft operating at its maximum lift coefficient (C_L_max) without stalling. The lowest possible velocity (V_min) is determined by the stall speed, which occurs at the maximum lift coefficient. Therefore, the combination of n_max and V_min will result in the tightest possible turn."
