        "reasoning": "The plate is a rigid body in a horizontal plane, hinged at A, B, and C, with a downward force P at D. AC and BD are diagonals, so A, B, C, D form a rectangle. Hinges at A, B, C provide vertical reactions only (no moment, no in-plane horizontal reaction is mentioned). For vertical equilibrium, R_A + R_B + R_C = P. For rotational equilibrium about any axis in the plane, the net moment must be zero. Because A, B, C are collinear along one side? No: in a rectangle, A, B, C are three corners; D is the fourth. However, the key geometric fact is that AC and BD are diagonals, so their intersection is the plate center, and the load at D can be represented as a combination of forces at A, B, C that give the same net force and moment. If we take the plate as a rigid body and consider moments about the line AC: the force at D has a certain moment; reactions at A and C lie on AC, so they have zero moment about AC, while reaction at B must balance the moment of P about AC. This forces R_B to be negative (downward) relative to the assumed upward positive direction. Similarly, considering moments about BD, only reactions at A and C contribute; symmetry about BD then requires R_A = R_C. Finally, vertical force equilibrium gives R_A + R_B + R_C = P. Solving these conditions yields R_A = P, R_B = -P, R_C = P. Thus option B is correct. The system is determinate because we can write three independent equilibrium equations for the rigid plate in 3D (sum of vertical forces and two independent moment equations about non-collinear axes), matching the three unknown reactions."

          "For rotational equilibrium about AC, the net moment must be zero. The moment of P about AC must be balanced by the moment of R_B. This requires R_B to be opposite in sense to P, i.e., R_B is downward (negative if upward is positive).",
          "Similarly, consider symmetry about diagonal BD: A and C are symmetric with respect to BD, and the loading (P at D) is symmetric with respect to exchanging A and C when viewed about BD, so R_A = R_C.",
          "Let R_A = R_C = R and R_B = -Q (downward). From vertical equilibrium: R + (-Q) + R = P ⇒ 2R - Q = P. From the moment balance about AC, the magnitudes must satisfy Q times its lever arm equals P times its lever arm; with the rectangle geometry, these lever arms are equal, so Q = P. Substituting Q = P into 2R - P = P gives 2R = 2P ⇒ R = P. Thus R_A = P, R_B = -P, R_C = P, matching option B."
