For a flat plate of zero thickness at zero angle of attack, there are no geometric features (thickness, camber, or angle of attack) to induce any acceleration or deceleration of the flow. Consequently, the flow remains undisturbed, meaning the local Mach number everywhere on the surface is identical to the freestream Mach number ($M_{local} = M_{\\infty}$). Therefore, the condition $M_{local} = 1$ will only be met when the freestream Mach number itself is 1. Hence, the critical Mach number for this specific configuration is 1."
