This is because at Mach 1, the flow over the flat plate will transition from subsonic to supersonic, and this is the critical point where the pressure coefficient changes sign. The linearized supersonic flow theory provides the formula $C_p = \\frac{2\\theta}{\\sqrt{M_\\infty^2 - 1}}$, which shows that at $M_\\infty = 1$, the pressure coefficient $C_p$ becomes undefined, indicating the critical Mach number. Therefore, the correct answer is 1."
