For a flat plate of zero thickness at zero angle of attack, there is no curvature or inclination to accelerate or compress the flow. Therefore, the flow velocity (and Mach number) remains unchanged from the freestream value everywhere over the plate. The freestream condition where sonic speed first appears on the plate is thus M=1. As soon as M_inf > 1, the entire flow is supersonic, and the sonic line is on the leading edge."
