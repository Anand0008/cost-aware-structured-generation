From the information provided in the image and the retrieved knowledge, the bending moment at the midpoint of a simply supported beam with an overhang and a uniformly distributed load (UDL) is given by the formula:\n\n$M = \\frac{qL^2}{8} - \\frac{qb^2}{2}$\n\nWhere:\n- $q$ is the UDL intensity\n- $L$ is the length of the main span\n- $b$ is the length of the overhang\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the overhang length $b = L/2$. Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n\n$M = \\frac{qL^2}{8} - \\frac{q(L/2)^2}{2} = \\frac{qL^2}{8} - \\frac{qL^2}{16} = \\frac{qL^2}{16}$\n\nThis matches the correct answer option A, which is a sagging bending moment at the midpoint of the beam."
