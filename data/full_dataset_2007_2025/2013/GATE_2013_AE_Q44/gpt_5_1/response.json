        "reasoning": "The beam has a main span AB of length L, simply supported at A and B, with an overhang of length L/2 beyond B. A uniformly distributed load of intensity q acts over the entire length from A to the free end. First, compute reactions using equilibrium of the whole beam. Total length is L + L/2 = 3L/2, so total load is q(3L/2). Taking moments about A (counter‑clockwise positive): \\(R_B L - q(3L/2)\\cdot(3L/4) = 0\\). The centroid of the UDL is at distance 3L/4 from A. Hence \\(R_B = q(3L/2)(3L/4)/L = 9qL/8\\). Then from vertical force equilibrium, \\(R_A + R_B = q(3L/2)\\Rightarrow R_A = q(3L/2) - 9qL/8 = 3qL/8\\). To find the bending moment at the midpoint of AB (distance L/2 from A), consider the left segment from A to the section. Internal bending moment at that section (sagging positive) is \\(M = R_A x - q x^2/2\\) with \\(x = L/2\\). Substituting \\(R_A = 3qL/8\\) and \\(x = L/2\\): \\(M = (3qL/8)(L/2) - q(L/2)^2/2 = 3qL^2/16 - qL^2/8 = (3qL^2 - 2qL^2)/16 = qL^2/16\\). The sign is positive (sagging) since the curvature is concave up under the main span. Therefore the correct option is A: \\(qL^2/16\\) sagging."
