        "reasoning": "The most stable configuration in roll is sweep back, dihedral, and high wing. This combination provides the strongest lateral stability through the following mechanisms:\n\n1. Sweep back: A swept-back wing creates a negative rolling moment during sideslip, as the leading wing experiences a higher angle of attack and lift compared to the trailing wing.\n\n2. Dihedral: Positive dihedral (upward wing angle) generates a restoring rolling moment during sideslip. The wing facing the sideslip experiences a higher effective angle of attack and lift, creating a stabilizing roll.\n\n3. High wing: In a high-wing configuration, the fuselage shields the lower wing from the sideslip airflow, reducing its lift and creating a differential lift between the upper and lower wings, which generates a stabilizing rolling moment.\n\nThe combination of these three design features - sweep back, dihedral, and high wing - provides the most effective lateral stability for an aircraft, making option D the correct answer."
