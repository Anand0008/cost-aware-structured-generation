        "reasoning": "Lateral stability refers to an aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance in roll. Several design features contribute to positive lateral stability, meaning they generate a restoring rolling moment when the aircraft experiences sideslip. Let's analyze each component:\n\n1.  **Dihedral**: This is the upward angle of the wings relative to the horizontal. Dihedral is a primary contributor to positive lateral stability (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). When an aircraft with dihedral experiences sideslip, the wing into the wind experiences a larger effective angle of attack and thus more lift, creating a restoring rolling moment that levels the wings.\n2.  **Sweepback**: Swept-back wings also contribute to positive lateral stability (RAG Chunk 5). During sideslip, the wing leading into the sideslip effectively becomes 'less swept' relative to the airflow, increasing its angle of attack and lift. The other wing becomes 'more swept', decreasing its angle of attack and lift. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment.\n3.  **High Wing Configuration**: A high-wing design generally enhances lateral stability (RAG Chunk 5). When in sideslip, the fuselage can 'shield' the lower wing from the airflow, reducing its lift, while the upper wing experiences relatively higher lift. This creates a restoring rolling moment.\n4.  **Anhedral**: This is the downward angle of the wings. Anhedral provides *negative* lateral stability, meaning it reduces stability or makes the aircraft less stable in roll. It is sometimes used on highly maneuverable aircraft or to counteract excessive stability from other features (RAG Chunk 4).\n5.  **Sweep Forward**: This is the opposite of sweepback. While not explicitly detailed in RAG, sweep forward generally has a destabilizing effect on lateral stability, or at least less stabilizing than sweepback.\n6.  **Low Wing Configuration**: A low-wing design typically requires *more* dihedral than a mid-wing or high-wing design to achieve the same level of lateral stability, implying it is less inherently stable in roll (RAG Chunks 1, 2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. Sweep back, anhedral and low wing**: Sweep back is stabilizing, but anhedral and low wing are destabilizing or require more compensation. This is not the most stable.\n*   **B. Sweep forward, dihedral and low wing**: Dihedral is stabilizing, but sweep forward and low wing are destabilizing or less stabilizing. This is not the most stable.\n*   **C. Sweep forward, anhedral and high wing**: High wing is stabilizing, but sweep forward and anhedral are destabilizing. This is not the most stable.\n*   **D. Sweep back, dihedral and high wing**: All three features (sweep back, dihedral, and high wing) contribute positively to lateral stability (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, this combination represents the most stable configuration in roll."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the concept of lateral stability. Lateral stability is the tendency of an aircraft to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance in roll, often quantified by the derivative of the rolling moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle, $C_{L_{\\beta}}$, which must be negative for positive stability.",
          "Step 2: Identify the effect of dihedral on lateral stability. Dihedral (upward wing angle) provides positive lateral stability. When sideslip occurs, the wing into the wind experiences a higher effective angle of attack, generating more lift and creating a restoring rolling moment (RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).",
          "Step 3: Identify the effect of wing sweep on lateral stability. Sweepback (wings swept rearward) provides positive lateral stability. During sideslip, the leading wing becomes effectively less swept, increasing lift, while the trailing wing becomes more swept, decreasing lift, resulting in a restoring rolling moment (RAG Chunk 5). Sweep forward would generally have the opposite or a less stabilizing effect.",
          "Step 4: Identify the effect of wing mounting position on lateral stability. A high-wing configuration generally provides positive lateral stability, as the fuselage can create a differential lift effect during sideslip (RAG Chunk 5). A low-wing configuration is less inherently stable and requires more dihedral to achieve the same stability (RAG Chunks 1, 2).",
          "Step 5: Identify the effect of anhedral on lateral stability. Anhedral (downward wing angle) provides negative lateral stability, reducing the aircraft's inherent stability in roll (RAG Chunk 4).",
          "Step 6: Evaluate each given option by combining the effects of its features. The most stable configuration will be the one where all or most features contribute positively to lateral stability.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that 'Sweep back, dihedral and high wing' (Option D) combines three features that all enhance lateral stability, making it the most stable configuration in roll."
