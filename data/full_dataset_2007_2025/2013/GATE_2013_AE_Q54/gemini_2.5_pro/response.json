        "reasoning": "The airplane trim lift coefficient ($C_{L_{trim}}$) for steady, unaccelerated, level flight is determined by balancing the lift force with the aircraft's weight. The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{\\infty} V^2 S C_{L_{trim}}$. In level flight, Lift (L) equals Weight (W). Therefore, $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{\\infty} V^2 S C_{L_{trim}}$. Rearranging this equation to solve for $C_{L_{trim}}$ gives $C_{L_{trim}} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho_{\\infty} V^2 S}$. The problem provides the wing loading ($W/S$), which can be directly substituted into the formula: $C_{L_{trim}} = \\frac{2(W/S)}{\\rho_{\\infty} V^2}$. Plugging in the given values: $W/S = 1000 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $V = 90 \\text{ m/s}$, and $\\rho_{\\infty} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, the calculation yields $C_{L_{trim}} = \\frac{2 \\times 1000}{1.22 \\times (90)^2} = \\frac{2000}{1.22 \\times 8100} = \\frac{2000}{9882} \\approx 0.20238$.
