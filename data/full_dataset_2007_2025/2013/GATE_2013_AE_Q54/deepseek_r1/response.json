These chunks explicitly state the formula $C_{L_{\\text{trim}}} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}$ and relate it to steady level flight. However, the retrieved knowledge did not include the specific wing loading form, but it was trivial to derive. The other chunks (2,3,4,6) were about elevator deflection, drag, and 2D coefficients, which were not directly needed for this part but are relevant for the linked questions. Overall, RAG was helpful for confirming the approach."
