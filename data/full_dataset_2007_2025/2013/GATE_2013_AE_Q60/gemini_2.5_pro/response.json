The wire acts as a conduit or medium for electricity, which is analogous to how water flows through a pipe.\nC. 'sea: beach' - The sea is *adjacent to* or *borders* the beach. The beach is a boundary, not a conduit for the sea.\nD. 'music: instrument' - Music is *produced by* an instrument. The instrument is a source or producer, not a conduit through which music flows.\n\nTherefore, 'electricity: wire' best expresses a relationship similar to 'water: pipe'."
