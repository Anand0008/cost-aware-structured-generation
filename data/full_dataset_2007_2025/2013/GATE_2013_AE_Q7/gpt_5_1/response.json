        "reasoning": "For typical fixed-wing aircraft, as Mach number increases into the supersonic regime, the aerodynamic center (AC) moves aft relative to the chord. If the center of gravity (CG) location is not drastically changed, this rearward shift increases the static margin, making the airplane more statically stable in pitch. RAG chunk 1 notes that in supersonic flight the AC shifts rearward and that the static stability derivative dC_m/dC_L must be more negative (i.e., stronger restoring moment) to satisfy dynamic stability conditions. This corresponds to greater pitch stability at supersonic speeds compared to subsonic, assuming the same CG. Therefore, option C, 'more stability in pitch at supersonic speeds than at subsonic speeds', is consistent with standard longitudinal stability theory for supersonic configurations and with the lecture reference."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall that longitudinal (pitch) static stability is mainly governed by the relative positions of the center of gravity (CG) and the aerodynamic center (AC), and by the slope dC_m/dC_L. A more negative dC_m/dC_L (for a given configuration) means higher static stability.",
          "Step 2: As Mach number increases from subsonic to supersonic, compressibility effects change the pressure distribution over the wing and tail. A key effect is that the aerodynamic center of a wing-body combination moves aft in supersonic flow.",
          "Step 3: With the AC moving aft while the CG is approximately fixed, the distance (AC - CG) increases. This increases the static margin, which makes dC_m/dC_L more negative in magnitude, i.e., the airplane becomes more statically stable in pitch.",
          "Step 4: RAG chunk 1 explains that in supersonic flight the condition for dynamic stability becomes stricter, requiring dC_m/dC_L to be more negative (e.g., < -0.1). This is equivalent to requiring a larger static margin, again indicating higher pitch stability at supersonic speeds.",
          "Step 5: Therefore, compared to its subsonic condition, the same airplane will generally experience more pitch stability at supersonic speeds. Hence, option C is the correct statement."

Other chunks discussed Mach number basics and supersonic aerodynamics more generally, which supported background understanding but were not strictly necessary. Core reasoning about increased static margin at supersonic speeds relied on standard flight mechanics knowledge consistent with the RAG."
