        "reasoning": "The question states that the aircraft is expected to fly at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. From the retrieved knowledge, we know that in supersonic flight, the aerodynamic center (AC) typically shifts rearward, and the pitching moment derivative with respect to speed (`C_m_u`) becomes significantly negative. This leads to a more negative `dC_m/dC_L` condition for dynamic stability in supersonic flight compared to subsonic flight. Therefore, the aircraft will experience more stability in pitch at supersonic speeds than at subsonic speeds, making option C the correct answer."
