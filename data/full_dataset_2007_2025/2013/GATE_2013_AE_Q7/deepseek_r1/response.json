        "reasoning": "In supersonic flight, the aerodynamic center (AC) shifts rearward due to changes in pressure distribution. For a fixed center of gravity (CG), this increases the static margin ($X_{ac} - X_{cg}$). Since longitudinal static stability is characterized by $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$, and a larger static margin makes this slope more negative, the airplane experiences greater pitch stability at supersonic speeds. This is supported by RAG Chunk 1, which states that for supersonic flight, the dynamic stability condition becomes $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < A_*$ with $A_*$ negative, imposing a stricter, more negative bound, implying increased stability."
