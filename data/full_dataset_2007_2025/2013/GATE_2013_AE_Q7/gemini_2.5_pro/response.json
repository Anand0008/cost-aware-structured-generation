        "reasoning": "As per fundamental aerodynamic principles and supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1), when an aircraft transitions from subsonic to supersonic speeds, its aerodynamic center (AC) typically shifts rearward. This rearward shift of the AC relative to the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) increases the static margin. A larger static margin implies that for a given disturbance (e.g., change in angle of attack or lift coefficient), a stronger restoring pitching moment is generated, making the aircraft more statically stable in pitch. Mathematically, this means the pitching moment derivative with respect to lift coefficient, $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}$, becomes more negative (i.e., its absolute value increases). The RAG context explicitly states that for supersonic flight, the condition for dynamic stability becomes $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < A_{star}$, where $A_{star}$ is a negative value (e.g., -0.1). This is a stricter requirement than just $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$ for subsonic flight, indicating that the aircraft must be designed to have a more negative $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}$ at supersonic speeds, which translates to increased static longitudinal stability."
