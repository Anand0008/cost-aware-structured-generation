        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the exit static temperature ($T_e$) of a rocket nozzle under isentropic and optimally expanded conditions. Given the chamber pressure ($P_c = 100$ bar), chamber temperature ($T_c = 3000$ K), and ambient pressure ($P_a = 1$ bar), the exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure for optimal expansion, i.e., $P_e = 1$ bar. The specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p = 1$ kJ/kg-K) is provided, but the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) is not. For isentropic flow, the temperature-pressure relation is $\\frac{T_e}{T_c} = \\left(\\frac{P_e}{P_c}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}$. Since $\\gamma$ is not given, it must be inferred. In GATE problems, a common default assumption for $\\gamma$ for combustion products or similar gases, when not specified, is often $1.4$ (for diatomic gases like air) or $1.2-1.3$ (for typical rocket exhaust). By working backward from the options, assuming $\\gamma = 1.4$ yields the closest answer. With $\\gamma = 1.4$, the exponent $\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1.4-1}{1.4} = \\frac{0.4}{1.4} = \\frac{2}{7}$. Substituting the values: $T_e = 3000 \\text{ K} \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\text{ bar}}{100 \\text{ bar}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{7}} = 3000 \\times (0.01)^{\\frac{2}{7}} \\approx 3000 \\times 0.2683 \\approx 804.9 \\text{ K}$. This value is approximately 805 K, matching option A."

Chunk 1 and Chunk 5 reinforced the understanding and application of isentropic flow relations in nozzles. The RAG also provided typical values for $\\gamma$ for combustion products (1.2-1.25), which helped in understanding the implicit assumption of $\\gamma=1.4$ required to match the options."
