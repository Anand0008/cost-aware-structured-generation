        "reasoning": "The exit static temperature is found by applying the isentropic pressure-temperature relation for a gas undergoing an isentropic, optimally expanded flow. Given the specific heat at constant pressure (cp = 1 kJ/kg-K) and assuming the working fluid behaves as an ideal gas with properties similar to air (implied by typical GATE contexts), the specific gas constant (R) can be taken as 0.287 kJ/kg-K. This yields a specific heat ratio (γ = cp/cv) of approximately 1.4. Using the isentropic relation T_e/T_c = (p_e/p_c)^((γ-1)/γ) with p_c = 100 bar, T_c = 3000 K, p_e = 1 bar (optimal expansion), the calculated T_e ≈ 805 K, matching option A. The RAG context (Chunk 6) provides a directly analogous worked example using the same formula."

For an isentropic flow of an ideal gas through a nozzle, static pressure and temperature are related by: $T_e / T_c = (p_e / p_c)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$, where subscript 'c' denotes chamber (stagnation) conditions and 'e' denotes exit static conditions.",
          "Step 2: Apply the 'optimally expanded' condition. This means the nozzle exit pressure equals the ambient pressure: $p_e = p_{ambient} = 1 \\text{ bar}$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the specific heat ratio (γ). Given $c_p = 1 \\text{ kJ/kg-K} = 1000 \\text{ J/kg-K}$. For an ideal gas, $c_p - c_v = R$. The specific gas constant R is not given, but for air (a common assumption in such problems), $R \\approx 287 \\text{ J/kg-K} = 0.287 \\text{ kJ/kg-K}$. Thus, $c_v = c_p - R \\approx 0.713 \\text{ kJ/kg-K}$. Then, $\\gamma = c_p / c_v \\approx 1000 / 713 \\approx 1.402$.",
          "Step 4: Compute the exponent. $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma \\approx (0.402)/(1.402) \\approx 0.2867$. Alternatively, using the relation $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma = R/c_p$, we get $0.287/1 = 0.287$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the pressure ratio. $p_e / p_c = 1 \\text{ bar} / 100 \\text{ bar} = 0.01$.",
          "Step 6: Apply the isentropic formula. $T_e = T_c \\times (p_e/p_c)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} = 3000 \\times (0.01)^{0.2867}$.",

Therefore, $T_e \\approx 3000 \\times 0.2671 \\approx 801.3 \\text{ K}$. Using $\\gamma = 1.4$ exactly gives $(0.4/1.4)=2/7 \\approx 0.2857$, and $(0.01)^{2/7} \\approx 0.268$, yielding $T_e \\approx 3000 \\times 0.268 = 804 \\text{ K}$.

Chunk 1 (Sutton) provides context on nozzle theory and the pressure-Mach relation, which is related. Chunk 3 (video) gives the exhaust velocity formula derived from isentropic relations, reinforcing the concepts. However, none of the chunks explicitly addressed the step of determining γ from the given cp, which required internal knowledge/assumption about the gas constant R. Overall, RAG was helpful but not fully sufficient for the complete solution."
