        "reasoning": "For a composite circular shaft with a steel core and aluminum annulus that are perfectly bonded and subjected to pure torsion, the cross-sections rotate together. This implies the angle of twist per unit length is the same in both materials. The shear strain in torsion is given by $\\gamma_{\\theta z}(r) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{\\mathrm{d}z} r$, which depends only on the twist rate and radius, not on material properties. Since the displacement field is continuous across the interface due to perfect bonding, $\\gamma_{\\theta z}$ is continuous across the steel–aluminum interface. Shear stress is related to shear strain by Hooke's law for shear: $\\tau_{\\theta z} = G\\,\\gamma_{\\theta z}$. Because the shear modulus $G$ of steel and aluminum are different, the same shear strain at the interface produces different shear stresses on each side, so $\\tau_{\\theta z}$ is discontinuous (it has a jump) at the interface. Therefore, only shear strain is continuous across the interface, matching option B. This matches the RAG explanation that in composite torsion, strain is continuous but stress is discontinuous when $G$ changes."
