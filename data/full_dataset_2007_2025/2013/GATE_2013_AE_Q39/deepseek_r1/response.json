Therefore, the shear strain (angular deformation) must be continuous. However, shear stress is related to shear strain via the material's shear modulus (τ = Gγ). Since the steel and aluminum have different shear moduli (G_steel ≠ G_al), the shear stress will be discontinuous (have a jump) at the interface. This fundamental principle is clearly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 and 2)."

For small deformations, the shear strain γ varies linearly with radius r: γ(r) = (θ/L) * r, where θ/L is the angle of twist per unit length, constant for the entire composite cross-section due to perfect bonding.",
          "Step 3: Apply displacement compatibility. Because the materials are perfectly bonded, they deform together. At the interface radius (r = R_interface), the deformation (shear strain) must be the same for both materials to avoid separation or slip. Hence, shear strain γ is continuous across the interface.",
          "Step 4: Apply the constitutive (stress-strain) relation. Shear stress τ = G * γ, where G is the shear modulus (material property). Steel and aluminum have different G values.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate continuity. At the interface, γ is the same for both materials, but G_steel ≠ G_aluminum. Therefore, τ_steel = G_steel * γ and τ_aluminum = G_aluminum * γ are not equal. Shear stress is discontinuous (has a jump) at the interface.",
