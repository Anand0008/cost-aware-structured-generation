This means that the angle of twist per unit length ($\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$) is the same for both materials at any given radius. Since shear strain ($\\gamma_{\\theta z}$) is directly proportional to the radial distance ($r$) and the angle of twist per unit length ($\\gamma_{\\theta z} = r \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$), the shear strain will be continuous across the interface. However, shear stress ($\\tau_{\\theta z}$) is related to shear strain by Hooke's Law for shear: $\\tau_{\\theta z} = G \\gamma_{\\theta z}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. Since steel and aluminum are different materials, they have different shear moduli ($G_{steel} \\neq G_{aluminum}$). Given that shear strain is continuous and $G$ changes abruptly, the shear stress must exhibit a discontinuity (a jump) at the interface. Therefore, only shear strain is continuous."

          "Step 3: Consider shear strain continuity. Due to perfect bonding, the deformation (specifically, the tangential displacement and thus the angle of twist) must be compatible across the interface. For a circular shaft under torsion, the shear strain ($\\gamma_{\\theta z}$) at any radius $r$ is given by $\\gamma_{\\theta z} = r \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$, where $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$ is the angle of twist per unit length. Since the entire composite shaft twists as a single unit, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$ is uniform across the cross-section. Therefore, at the interface radius, the shear strain in both materials must be identical, making it continuous.",
          "Step 4: Consider shear stress continuity. Shear stress ($\\tau_{\\theta z}$) is related to shear strain ($\\gamma_{\\theta z}$) by Hooke's Law for shear: $\\tau_{\\theta z} = G \\gamma_{\\theta z}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. Steel and aluminum are different materials and thus have different shear moduli ($G_{steel} \\neq G_{aluminum}$).",
          "Step 5: Conclude on continuity. Since $\\gamma_{\\theta z}$ is continuous at the interface, but $G$ changes abruptly from $G_{steel}$ to $G_{aluminum}$, the shear stress $\\tau_{\\theta z}$ must change abruptly (discontinuously) at the interface."
