Under pure torsion, the shear strain (`gamma_theta_z`) will be continuous across the steel-aluminum interface because the two materials are tightly bonded and deform as a single body. However, the shear stress (`tau_theta_z`) will exhibit a discontinuity (jump) at the interface due to the difference in the shear moduli (`G`) of the two materials. Therefore, the correct statement is that only the shear strain is continuous across the steel-aluminum interface."
