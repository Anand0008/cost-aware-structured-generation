    "question_text": "Consider two rockets P and Q fired vertically up with identical specific impulse and a payload of 2 kg. Rocket P has 2 identical stages, and each stage has 200 kg of propellant and 20 kg of structural weight. Rocket Q has a single stage with 400 kg of propellant and 40 kg of structural weight. Neglecting drag and gravity effects, the ratio of the change in velocity of P to that attained by Q is"
