          "name": "Rayleigh's Method (for distributed mass)",
          "description": "Rayleigh's method is an energy method used to approximate the fundamental natural frequency of continuous systems (like beams with distributed mass). It involves assuming a deflection shape, calculating the maximum potential energy (strain energy) and maximum kinetic energy, and then using Rayleigh's quotient. For a cantilever beam with distributed mass, the formula is more complex, often involving integrals.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Can account for distributed mass, provides an upper bound for the fundamental frequency, useful when exact solutions are complex. Cons: Requires assuming an accurate mode shape, more computationally intensive than SDOF for simple cases, not directly applicable when beam mass is negligible.",
          "when_to_use": "When the mass of the beam itself is significant compared to the tip mass, or when higher modes of vibration are being considered. Not suitable for this specific problem due to the 'negligible mass' assumption."
