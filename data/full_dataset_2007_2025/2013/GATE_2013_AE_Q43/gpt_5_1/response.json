For a cantilever with a tip load, the static deflection is \\(\\delta = \\frac{PL^3}{3EI}\\), giving equivalent stiffness \\(k = \\frac{P}{\\delta} = \\frac{3EI}{L^3}\\). The natural frequency is \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3EI}{mL^3}}\\). Rearranging for E: \\(E = \\frac{\\omega_n^2 m L^3}{3I}\\). The rectangular cross-section has width b = 8 mm and thickness h = 6 mm; for bending in the plane of thickness, \\(I = \\frac{b h^3}{12}\\). Converting to meters: b = 0.008 m, h = 0.006 m, so \\(I = \\frac{0.008 \\times (0.006)^3}{12} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-10} \\\\text{ m}^4\\).
