The idealized cross-section has four identical booms arranged symmetrically at corners of a square (coordinates (±a, ±a)) with equal boom areas. The bending moment M is applied at 45° to the x-axis (as inferred from typical GATE problems and the image description implying equal components). For such a symmetric section, I_xx = I_yy and I_xy = 0. The neutral axis equation for unsymmetrical bending simplifies to (M_x/I_xx)y + (M_y/I_yy)x = 0. With M_x = M sin45°, M_y = M cos45°, and I_xx = I_yy, we get y + x = 0, i.e., the neutral axis is at -45° (clockwise from x-axis). Thus, inclination is 45° clockwise."

          "Step 3: Determine the components of the applied bending moment M. From the figure (typical representation), M is applied at 45° to the x-axis, so M_x = M sin45° = M/√2, M_y = M cos45° = M/√2.",

However, the chunks did not explicitly address the calculation of neutral axis inclination for a four-boom square section under 45° bending moment. The retrieved knowledge emphasized neutral axis through centroid and moments of inertia, which are foundational. The specific problem required applying unsymmetrical bending formula, which was not directly in RAG. Thus, internal knowledge was used for the solution steps."
