This is because the beam is subjected to a pure bending moment M, and for a symmetric cross-section like the one shown, the neutral axis will pass through the centroid of the cross-section. Since the cross-section is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, the neutral axis will bisect the angle between the x-axis and y-axis, resulting in a 45-degree inclination in the clockwise direction."
