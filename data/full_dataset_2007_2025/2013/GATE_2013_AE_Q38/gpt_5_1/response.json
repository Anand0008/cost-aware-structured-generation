        "reasoning": "The four identical booms form a non-symmetric cross-section: two booms on a vertical line separated by 2a, and two booms on a horizontal line at mid‑height, each a distance a from the vertical line. Taking the origin at the intersection of the two webs (center), boom coordinates are: top (0,a), bottom (0,-a), left (-a,0), right (a,0). All booms have equal area A. The centroid is at the origin by symmetry. For an idealized boom section, the second moments of area about centroidal axes are \\(I_{xx} = \\sum A y^2\\) and \\(I_{yy} = \\sum A x^2\\), and the product of inertia is \\(I_{xy} = \\sum A x y\\). Substituting the coordinates: \\(I_{xx} = A(a^2 + a^2 + 0 + 0) = 2Aa^2\\); \\(I_{yy} = A(0 + 0 + a^2 + a^2) = 2Aa^2\\); \\(I_{xy} = A(0 + 0 + (-a)(0) + a(0)) = 0\\). Thus the centroidal x and y axes are principal axes with equal second moments. The applied bending moment M acts along the positive x‑direction (horizontal). Bending stresses are proportional to the component of M about each principal axis. Since \\(I_{xx} = I_{yy}\\), the neutral axis is at 45\\(^\\circ\\) to the direction of the bending moment. From the figure, the neutral axis is rotated clockwise from the x‑axis, giving 45 CW, i.e. option A."
