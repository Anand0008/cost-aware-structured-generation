        "reasoning": "For a thin plate of thickness t and width b subjected to a uniform bending moment M about the z-axis (out of plane), the resulting stress field is a uniaxial normal stress varying linearly through the depth b (y-direction) and independent of x: \\(\\sigma_x = -My/I\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\), \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\). For a 2D Airy stress function \\(\\phi(x,y)\\), stresses are \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial y^2\\), \\(\\sigma_y = \\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial x^2\\), \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial x\\partial y\\). We need an Airy function that produces \\(\\sigma_x\\) depending only on y and linear in y, with \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\). Option B proposes \\(\\phi = 2M y^3/(t b^3)\\). Differentiating: \\(\\partial \\phi/\\partial y = 6M y^2/(t b^3)\\), so \\(\\sigma_x = \\partial^2 \\phi/\\partial y^2 = 12M y/(t b^3)\\), which is linear in y and independent of x, matching the bending-stress form. Also \\(\\partial \\phi/\\partial x = 0\\), so \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\), consistent with pure bending. The constant factor \\(12/(t b^3)\\) can be matched to \\(M/I\\) by noting \\(I = b^3 t/12\\) for a plate of thickness t and width b about the z-axis, giving \\(\\sigma_x = My/I\\). Thus option B is a valid Airy stress function; the other options introduce x-dependence or wrong powers of y that do not correspond to the simple bending state."

While not exactly this plate problem, they reinforced the derivative relations and the idea of representing simple beam theory with Airy functions, which directly supports the reasoning here."
