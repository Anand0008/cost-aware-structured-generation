        "reasoning": "The problem describes a thin rectangular plate under pure bending moment `M`. From elementary beam theory, the normal stress `$\\sigma_x$` for a beam of thickness `t` and depth `b` under pure bending is given by `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{I}$`, where `I` is the moment of inertia. For a rectangular cross-section, `I = \\frac{tb^3}{12}$`. Thus, `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{(tb^3/12)} = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. In pure bending, `$\\sigma_y = 0$` and `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`. An Airy's stress function `$\\phi$` must satisfy these stress conditions when differentiated:\n`$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`\n`$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`\n`$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`\n\nLet's test Option B: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} y^3$`\n1. `$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} (3y^2) = \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2$`\n2. `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{6M}{tb^3} (2y) = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. This matches the expected normal stress.\n3. `$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = 0$`\n4. `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = 0$`. This matches the expected normal stress in y-direction.\n5. `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2 \\right) = 0$`. This matches the expected shear stress.\n\nFinally, a valid Airy's stress function must also satisfy the biharmonic compatibility equation `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`. For `$\\phi = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} y^3$`:\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4} = 0$`\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial y^4} = \\frac{\\partial^3}{\\partial y^3} \\left( \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{12My}{tb^3} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{12M}{tb^3} \\right) = 0$`\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} = 0$`\nSince all fourth derivatives are zero, `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`.

          "Step 3: Calculate the moment of inertia `I` for the rectangular cross-section. With thickness `t` and depth `b`, the moment of inertia about the neutral axis (x-axis, passing through the centroid) is `I = \\frac{tb^3}{12}$`.",
          "Step 4: Substitute `I` into the flexure formula to get the explicit expression for `$\\sigma_x$`: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{(tb^3/12)} = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`.",
          "Step 5: Recall the relationships between stresses and Airy's stress function `$\\phi$`: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`, `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`.",

These match the expected stress state.",

CHUNK 6 confirmed the pure bending concept. The RAG content was highly relevant and helpful."
