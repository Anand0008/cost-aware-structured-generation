It did not give this exact velocity field, but supported the method (using stream function and recognizing hyperbolas). Additional PDE characteristic example also reinforced recognition of y^2 - x^2 = C as hyperbolas. Core solution relied on standard streamline relation dy/dx = v/u from internal knowledge, consistent with RAG."
