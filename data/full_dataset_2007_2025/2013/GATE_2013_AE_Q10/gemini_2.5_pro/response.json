        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the family of curves representing the streamlines for a given 2D velocity field. The fundamental definition of a streamline in 2D Cartesian coordinates is that its slope `dy/dx` is equal to the ratio of the y-component of velocity `v` to the x-component of velocity `u`. Given `u = cy/(x² + y²)` and `v = cx/(x² + y²)`, we can set up the differential equation for the streamlines:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{v}{u} = \\frac{cx/(x^2 + y^2)}{cy/(x^2 + y^2)}$\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y}$\n\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$y \\, dy = x \\, dx$\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n$\\int y \\, dy = \\int x \\, dx$\n\n$\\frac{y^2}{2} = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C'$\n\nWhere `C'` is the constant of integration. Rearranging the terms to identify the curve:\n$y^2 - x^2 = 2C'$\n\nLet `K = 2C'` (which is also an arbitrary constant). The equation of the streamlines becomes:\n$y^2 - x^2 = K$\n\nThis is the standard equation for a family of hyperbolas. Therefore, the streamlines are hyperbolas."
