        "reasoning": "For an axial compressor stage, the specific work is given by Euler\\'s turbomachinery equation: $W = u \\Delta c_t = u(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$. With constant axial velocity $c_a$ and given absolute inlet angle $\\alpha_1$, we have $c_{t1} = c_a \\tan \\alpha_1$. For a 50\\% reaction stage with constant axial velocity, the velocity triangles satisfy $R_D = 0.5 = 0.5\\,(c_a/u)(\\tan \\beta_1 + \\tan \\beta_2)$ and $W = u c_a(\\tan \\alpha_2 - \\tan \\alpha_1) = u c_a(\\tan \\beta_1 - \\tan \\beta_2)$. Using $R_D = 0.5$ gives $\\tan \\beta_1 + \\tan \\beta_2 = u/c_a = 300/100 = 3$. The work expression gives $W/(u c_a) = \\tan \\beta_1 - \\tan \\beta_2$. In a 50\\% reaction repeating stage, the stator and rotor are symmetric, which leads to $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\beta_1$. With $\\alpha_1 = 45^\\circ$, $\\tan \\alpha_1 = 1$, so $\\tan \\beta_2 = 1$. Then from $\\tan \\beta_1 + \\tan \\beta_2 = 3$, we get $\\tan \\beta_1 = 2$. Thus $\\tan \\beta_1 - \\tan \\beta_2 = 2 - 1 = 1$. Therefore $W = u c_a (\\tan \\beta_1 - \\tan \\beta_2) = 300 \\times 100 \\times 1 = 30000\\,\\text{J/kg} = 30\\,\\text{kJ/kg}$.
