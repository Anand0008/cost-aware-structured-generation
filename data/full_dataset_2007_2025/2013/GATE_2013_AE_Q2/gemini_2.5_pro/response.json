Then, the differential $du = (2x + 4) dx = 2(x + 2) dx$, which implies $(x + 2) dx = \\frac{1}{2} du$. The limits of integration must also be changed: for $x=4$, $u_{lower} = 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11$; for $x=5$, $u_{upper} = 5^2 + 4(5) - 21 = 25 + 20 - 21 = 24$. The integral transforms to $\\int_{11}^{24} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{11}^{24} \\frac{1}{u} du$. Evaluating this, we get $\\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_{11}^{24} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(24) - \\ln(11))$. Using the logarithm property $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(\\frac{a}{b})$, this becomes $\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(\\frac{24}{11})$. Finally, using the property $k \\ln a = \\ln(a^k)$, the expression simplifies to $\\ln((\\frac{24}{11})^{1/2}) = \\ln(\\sqrt{\\frac{24}{11}})$. This matches option A."
