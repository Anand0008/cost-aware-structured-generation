          "description": "Let $u = x^{2}+4x-21$. Then $du = (2x+4)dx = 2(x+2)dx$, so $(x+2)dx = du/2$. The integral becomes $\\int_{x=4}^{5} \\frac{x+2}{x^{2}+4x-21}dx = \\int_{u(4)}^{u(5)} \\frac{1}{u}\\cdot\\frac{du}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{11}^{24} \\frac{du}{u} = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{24}{11}\\right)$. This is the same logic as recognizing the $f'(x)/f(x)$ pattern but written explicitly as substitution.",

However, in this specific problem, the numerator is already proportional to the derivative of the denominator, so this method is unnecessarily long.",
