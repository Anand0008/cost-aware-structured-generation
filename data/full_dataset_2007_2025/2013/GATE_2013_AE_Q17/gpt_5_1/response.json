        "reasoning": "The section is an open thin-walled channel made of three flat plates of uniform thickness. For thin open sections, torsional stiffness is very low and the Saint-Venant torsion constant J is obtained by summing contributions of each wall: for a flat strip of thickness t and length l, the torsion constant is approximately $J_i = \\frac{1}{3} t^3 l$. The channel has two horizontal flanges of length 300 mm and one vertical web of length 600 mm, all with thickness 2 mm. Converting to meters: $t = 0.002$ m, $l_{flange} = 0.3$ m, $l_{web} = 0.6$ m. Then\n$J = \\frac{1}{3} t^3 (2 l_{flange} + l_{web}) = \\frac{1}{3} (0.002)^3 (2 \\times 0.3 + 0.6) = \\frac{1}{3} (8 \\times 10^{-9})(1.2) \\approx 3.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$.\nUsing the torsion relation $T = G J \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$, the twist per unit length is $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{T}{GJ}$. With $T = 10$ N m, $G = 25$ GPa $= 25 \\times 10^9$ N/m$^2$, and $J \\approx 3.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ m$^4$, we get\n$\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{10}{25 \\times 10^9 \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx \\frac{10}{80} = 0.125$ rad/m.\nThis lies within the official answer range 0.12 to 0.13 rad/m, confirming the key."
