        "reasoning": "The problem describes a supersonic stream undergoing a gradual expansion, which is an isentropic process governed by the Prandtl-Meyer function. The key principle is that for an expansion, the Prandtl-Meyer function value increases by the turning angle. \\n\\n1.  **Identify upstream conditions:** The initial Mach number is given as $M_1 = 2$. From the provided table, the Prandtl-Meyer function value corresponding to $M_1 = 2$ is $\\nu_1 = 26.38$ degrees.\\n2.  **Apply expansion relation:** For an expansion, the downstream Prandtl-Meyer function $\\nu_2$ is related to the upstream value $\\nu_1$ and the turning angle $\\Delta\\theta$ by the formula: $\\nu_2 = \\nu_1 + \\Delta\\theta$. The turning angle is given as $\\Delta\\theta = 3$ degrees.\\n    Therefore, $\\nu_2 = 26.38^{\\circ} + 3^{\\circ} = 29.38^{\\circ}$.\\n3.  **Determine downstream Mach number:** Now, we need to find the Mach number $M_2$ that corresponds to $\\nu_2 = 29.38^{\\circ}$ from the given table. Looking at the table:\\n    *   For $M = 2.1$, $\\nu = 29.10^{\\circ}$\\n    *   For $M = 2.2$, $\\nu = 31.73^{\\circ}$\\n    Since $29.38^{\\circ}$ lies between $29.10^{\\circ}$ and $31.73^{\\circ}$, $M_2$ must be between $2.1$ and $2.2$. We use linear interpolation:\\n    $\\frac{M_2 - M_{2.1}}{\\nu_2 - \\nu_{2.1}} = \\frac{M_{2.2} - M_{2.1}}{\\nu_{2.2} - \\nu_{2.1}}$\\n    $\\frac{M_2 - 2.1}{29.38 - 29.10} = \\frac{2.2 - 2.1}{31.73 - 29.10}$\\n    $\\frac{M_2 - 2.1}{0.28} = \\frac{0.1}{2.63}$\\n    $M_2 - 2.1 = 0.28 \\times \\frac{0.1}{2.63}$\\n    $M_2 - 2.1 = \\frac{0.028}{2.63}$\\n    $M_2 - 2.1 \\approx 0.010646$\\n    $M_2 \\approx 2.1 + 0.010646 \\approx 2.1106$\\n4.  **Match with options:** The calculated value $M_2 \\approx 2.11$ closely matches option C."
