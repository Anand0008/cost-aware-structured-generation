        "notes": "RAG provided relevant examples of surface integrals and Gauss's theorem over a sphere (Chunks 2 and 4). Chunk 2 specifically shows Gauss theorem application for a vector field over a unit sphere. Chunk 4 demonstrates direct surface integral evaluation on a sphere. Other chunks (1, 3, 5, 6) were about aerodynamics point sources, domain of functions, and orthogonal surfaces, which are not directly relevant to this vector calculus problem. Thus, the RAG context was partially helpful."
