        "reasoning": "The problem asks to evaluate a surface integral `I = \\iint_S (y^2zi + z^2xj + x^2yk) \\cdot (xi + yj + zk) dS` over the surface of a unit sphere centered at the origin. Let the vector field be `G = y^2zi + z^2xj + x^2yk`. The term `(xi + yj + zk)` represents the position vector `\\vec{r}`. For a unit sphere centered at the origin, the outward unit normal vector `\\hat{n}` is given by `\\vec{r} / |\\vec{r}|`. Since `|\\vec{r}| = 1` on the surface of a unit sphere, `\\hat{n} = xi + yj + zk`. Therefore, the integral can be written as `I = \\iint_S (G \\cdot \\hat{n}) dS`. This is a classic form for applying Gauss's Divergence Theorem, which states that `\\iint_S (G \\cdot \\hat{n}) dS = \\iiint_V (\\nabla \\cdot G) dV`, where `V` is the volume enclosed by the surface `S`. First, we calculate the divergence of `G`: `\\nabla \\cdot G = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2z) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(z^2x) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2y)`. Each partial derivative is zero: `\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2z) = 0`, `\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(z^2x) = 0`, `\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2y) = 0`. Thus, `\\nabla \\cdot G = 0`. Substituting this into Gauss's Divergence Theorem, `I = \\iiint_V (0) dV = 0`. The value of the integral is 0."

          "Step 2: Recognize the dot product term. The term `(xi + yj + zk)` is the position vector `\\vec{r}`. For a unit sphere centered at the origin, the outward unit normal vector `\\hat{n}` is equal to the position vector `\\vec{r}` (since `|\\vec{r}| = 1` on the surface). Thus, the integral is of the form `\\iint_S (\\vec{G} \\cdot \\hat{n}) dS`.",

The divergence operator is `\\nabla \\cdot = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}i + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}j + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}k`. So, `\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{G} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2z) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(z^2x) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2y)`.",
