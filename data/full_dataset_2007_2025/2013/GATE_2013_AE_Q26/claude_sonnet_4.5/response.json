By applying the properties of the dot product and the symmetry of the sphere, we can show that the net flux through the entire surface is zero. Specifically:\n1. The dot product `(y²zi + z²xj + x²yk) · (xi + yj + zk)` can be expanded as `(y²z)x + (z²x)y + (x²y)z`. \n2. Integrating this expression over the surface of the sphere, the x, y, and z terms will each integrate to zero due to the symmetry of the sphere. This is because for any point (x, y, z) on the sphere, there is an equal and opposite point (-x, -y, -z) that cancels out the contribution.\n3. Therefore, the overall surface integral `I` evaluates to 0, which matches the correct answer provided."
