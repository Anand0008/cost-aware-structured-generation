From the given data, we can calculate the total number of tourists as 2000 + 3500 + 1200 + 1100 + 2400 + 2300 + 1000 = 13500. One-third of this total is 4500 tourists. \n\nLooking at the data, the two countries that contributed to more than 4500 tourists are England with 3500 and France with 1000, for a total of 4500 tourists. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: England and France."
