          "**Step 1: Identify Column Properties and End Conditions.** The column BD has a length of $L = 2$ m. It has a circular cross-section with a radius of $r = 10$ mm. The Young's modulus of the steel is $E = 200$ GPa. Column BD is pinned at both ends (B and D).",
          "**Step 2: Calculate Moment of Inertia ($I$).** For a solid circular cross-section, the moment of inertia about its centroidal axis is given by $I = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4}$. Convert the radius to meters: $r = 10 \\text{ mm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}$. Calculate $I = \\frac{\\pi (0.01)^4}{4} = 7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$.",
          "**Step 3: Determine Effective Length ($L_e$).** For a column pinned at both ends, the effective length factor $k = 1.0$. Therefore, the effective length $L_e = kL = 1.0 \\times 2 \\text{ m} = 2 \\text{ m}$.",
          "**Step 4: Calculate Euler's Critical Buckling Load ($P_{cr}$).** Use Euler's formula for long columns: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L_e^2}$. Substitute the values: $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $I = 7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$, and $L_e = 2 \\text{ m}$. $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(2 \\text{ m})^2} \\approx 3874.48 \\text{ N}$.",
          "**Step 5: Analyze Beam ABC for Force in Column BD ($F_{BD}$).** Consider the horizontal beam ABC. It is supported by a hinge at A and by the column BD at B. A downward load $P$ is applied at C. To find the compressive force in column BD ($F_{BD}$), which acts upwards on the beam at B, apply the moment equilibrium equation about point A. The distances are AB = 1 m and BC = 1 m, so AC = 2 m. $\\Sigma M_A = 0 \\implies F_{BD} \\times (1 \\text{ m}) - P \\times (2 \\text{ m}) = 0$. This gives $F_{BD} = 2P$.",
          "**Step 6: Equate Forces and Solve for $P$.** For the column BD to buckle, the compressive force it experiences ($F_{BD}$) must be equal to its critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$). So, $F_{BD} = P_{cr}$. Substitute $2P = 3874.48 \\text{ N}$. Solving for $P$: $P = \\frac{3874.48}{2} \\approx 1937.24 \\text{ N}$."
