Typical interpretation: A, B, C are colinear horizontal points with AB = BC = 1 m (common in such problems), B directly above D, BD vertical of length 2 m. Load P applied at C vertically downward.",
          "Step 2: Compute the axial force in member BD as a function of P. Use static equilibrium of the entire structure. Take moments about point A: Sum of moments = 0 => Force in BD (F_BD) multiplied by horizontal distance from A to D (1 m) equals P multiplied by horizontal distance from A to C (2 m). Thus, F_BD * 1 = P * 2 => F_BD = 2P. (Assume BD is a two-force member in compression.)",
          "Step 3: Determine the critical buckling load for column BD using Euler's formula for pinned-pinned ends: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L_e^2}$, where $L_e = L_{BD}$ (since k=1).",

          "Step 6: Set the internal force equal to the critical load at buckling: F_BD = P_{cr} => 2P = 3875 N => P = 3875/2 = 1937.5 N ≈ 1940 N.",
          "Step 7: Verify that the slenderness ratio is high enough for Euler buckling to apply. For steel, with yield strength typically ~250 MPa, limiting slenderness ratio is about 100. Actual L_e/r = 2 / (0.01/2?) Wait, radius of gyration for solid circle: r_g = sqrt(I/A) = sqrt((π/4 r^4)/(π r^2)) = r/2 = 0.005 m.
