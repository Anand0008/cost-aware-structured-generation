          "Step 2: Analyze the cruise phase. The primary objectives are to cover distance efficiently (minimize time and fuel). For a required airspeed (and thus lift), a tailwind increases $V_{gnd}$, meaning the aircraft covers more ground per unit time, reducing flight time and fuel burn. A headwind has the opposite effect.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the landing phase. The primary objectives are to touch down at a safe, controlled speed and minimize the ground roll required to stop. A headwind increases $V_{air}$ for a given $V_{gnd}$, allowing the pilot to maintain adequate lift and control at a lower $V_{gnd}$. This reduces the kinetic energy at touchdown, shortening the landing distance and improving safety.",
