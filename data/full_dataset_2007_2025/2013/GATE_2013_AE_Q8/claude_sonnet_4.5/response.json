Option A, 'Tail wind in cruise and head wind in landing', is the correct answer.\n\nDuring cruise, a tailwind is favorable as it increases the aircraft's ground speed, improving range and efficiency. During landing, a headwind is favorable as it increases the aircraft's airspeed relative to the ground, reducing the required landing distance and improving control.\n\nOptions B and C are not favorable, as tailwinds in both cruise and landing, or headwinds in both cruise and landing, would be detrimental to aircraft performance. Option D is also not favorable, as a headwind during cruise would reduce the aircraft's ground speed and efficiency, while a tailwind during landing would increase the required landing distance and reduce control."
