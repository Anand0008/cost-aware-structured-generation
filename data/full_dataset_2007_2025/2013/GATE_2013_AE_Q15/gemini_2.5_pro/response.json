          "Step 1: Identify the given information. The system is a damped SDOF system under harmonic excitation. The amplitude ratio (magnification factor) at resonance is given as 2.5. The objective is to find the damping ratio ($\\zeta$).",
          "Step 2: Recall or look up the formula for the maximum amplitude magnification factor (MF) at resonance for a damped SDOF system. This formula is $\\text{MF}_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}}$.",
          "Step 3: Substitute the given value of $\\text{MF}_{\\text{max}} = 2.5$ into the formula: $2.5 = \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}}$.",
          "Step 4: Rearrange the equation to isolate the term involving $\\zeta$: $0.2 = \\zeta \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$.",
          "Step 5: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root: $(0.2)^2 = (\\zeta \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2})^2 \\implies 0.04 = \\zeta^2 (1 - \\zeta^2)$.",
          "Step 6: Expand and rearrange the equation into a quadratic form in terms of $\\zeta^2$: $\\zeta^4 - \\zeta^2 + 0.04 = 0$. Let $y = \\zeta^2$, so $y^2 - y + 0.04 = 0$.",

          "Step 8: Calculate the damping ratio $\\zeta$ from $y = \\zeta^2$ for both solutions: $\\zeta_1 = \\sqrt{y_1} \\approx 0.9789$ and $\\zeta_2 = \\sqrt{y_2} \\approx 0.2043$.",
          "Step 9: Apply the physical condition for the validity of the resonance peak formula: the damping ratio must be less than $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$. Discard $\\zeta_1$ as it is greater than $0.707$. The valid damping ratio is $\\zeta_2 \\approx 0.2043$.",
