        "reasoning": "Engine P uses 5% compressor bleed for turbine blade cooling. This bleed air bypasses the combustor and turbine flow path, so for the same compressor inlet mass flow, less air reaches the combustor and turbine compared with engine Q.\n\nOption-wise:\nA. Turbine inlet temperature is higher for engine P: With blade cooling, designers can safely use a higher turbine inlet temperature (TIT) without exceeding blade material limits. So P can have higher TIT than an uncooled engine Q for the same material technology. This is TRUE.\n\nB. Specific thrust is higher for engine P: Higher TIT increases turbine work and allows higher jet exhaust temperature and velocity, which generally increases specific thrust. The small loss of mass flow due to bleed is usually more than compensated by the gain from higher TIT. So P tends to have higher specific thrust. This is TRUE in the intended qualitative comparison.\n\nC. Compressor work is the same for both P and Q: The bleed is taken after the compression process, so the compressor pressure ratio and exit conditions are essentially the same. The compressor still compresses the same inlet mass flow; only after compression is 5% bled off. Thus compressor work per unit inlet mass flow is effectively the same. This is TRUE in the usual idealized comparison.\n\nD. Fuel flow rate is lower for engine P: To reach a higher TIT in P, more heat must be added per kg of air that actually enters the combustor. Even though 5% of the air is bled off, the remaining 95% must be heated to a higher temperature than in Q. For the same inlet conditions and fuel heating value, this requires a higher fuel-air ratio and hence a higher fuel flow rate per unit inlet air mass for P, not lower. Therefore the statement that fuel flow rate is lower for P is NOT true.\n\nThus option D is the only incorrect statement and matches the official key."

For P, include 5% bleed and higher TIT; for Q, no bleed and lower TIT. Use energy balance to compute fuel flow per unit inlet air and specific thrust, then compare numerically.",
