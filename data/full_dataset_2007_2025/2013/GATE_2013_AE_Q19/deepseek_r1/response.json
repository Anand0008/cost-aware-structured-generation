        "reasoning": "The official answer is D, and analysis confirms it is NOT TRUE. Cooling bleed (engine P) enables a higher Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) by protecting blades, so option A is TRUE. Higher TIT typically increases exhaust velocity, raising specific thrust (B TRUE). Compressor work is determined by inlet mass flow and pressure ratio; bleeding after compression does not alter the work done on the total air ingested (C TRUE). However, to achieve the higher TIT, the combustor must supply more heat. Although bleed reduces air to combustor, the required temperature rise is larger, leading to a higher fuel flow rate (or at least not lower) for engine P, making D FALSE."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the configuration. Engine P uses a 5% bleed from compressor exit to cool HP turbine blades; engine Q has no cooling bleed.",
          "Step 2: Analyze effect on Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT). Cooling allows turbine blades to withstand higher gas temperatures. Therefore, engine P can be designed to operate at a higher TIT than engine Q. So statement A is TRUE.",
          "Step 3: Analyze effect on specific thrust. Specific thrust depends on exhaust velocity and mass flow. Higher TIT increases exhaust energy and velocity, typically increasing specific thrust. Bleed slightly reduces mass flow through the nozzle, but the net effect is usually higher specific thrust. So B is TRUE.",
          "Step 4: Analyze compressor work. The compressor work is based on the total air mass flow rate entering the compressor and the pressure ratio. Bleeding 5% after compression does not change the work done to compress the entire inlet air flow. Assuming same inlet conditions and pressure ratio, compressor work is the same for both engines. So C is TRUE.",
          "Step 5: Analyze fuel flow rate. For engine P, the combustor receives only 95% of the compressed air. To achieve a higher TIT (as allowed by cooling), the combustor must provide a greater temperature rise. This requires a higher fuel-air ratio. Even with less air, the increased fuel-air ratio often results in a higher fuel mass flow rate. Alternatively, if TIT were kept the same, mixing with cool bleed air would require an even hotter combustor exit temperature, again increasing fuel flow. Thus, fuel flow rate is not lower for engine P; it is likely higher. Therefore D is NOT TRUE."
