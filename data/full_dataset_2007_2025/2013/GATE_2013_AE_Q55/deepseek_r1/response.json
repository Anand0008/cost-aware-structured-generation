Chunk 2's formula $C_{M,cgw} = C_{M,acw} + C_{L,w} (h_{acw} - h)$ is conceptually identical to the one used, though the sign convention in the derived answer differs from the chunk's form. This highlights a common point of confusion. The RAG context was sufficient to understand the core concepts but did not explicitly address the specific trim calculation for a wing-body alone configuration. Internal knowledge was used to select the sign convention consistent with the GATE answer."
