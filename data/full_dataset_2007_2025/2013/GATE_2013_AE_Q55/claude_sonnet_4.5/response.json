The relationship between the CG, NP, and static margin is given by:\nC_m_alpha_aircraft = C_L_alpha_aircraft * ((X_cg - X_np) / c_bar)\nFor static stability, C_m_alpha_aircraft < 0, which implies (X_cg - X_np) / c_bar < 0, or X_cg < X_np.\nSince X_ac = 0.25c, and for a stable aircraft X_cg < X_np, the CG must be located at X_cg < 0.25c.
