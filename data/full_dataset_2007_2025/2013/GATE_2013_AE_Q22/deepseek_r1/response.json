        "reasoning": "The combustor volume is a critical design parameter that ensures sufficient residence time for complete and efficient combustion. Residence time ($\\tau$) is approximately $\\tau = V / \\dot{V}$, where $V$ is combustor volume and $\\dot{V}$ is volumetric flow rate of air. Volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V} = \\dot{m}_a / \\rho$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is air mass flow rate and $\\rho$ is air density. For a given engine operating at a fixed corrected mass flow or thrust requirement, the air mass flow rate decreases with altitude due to lower density, but the volumetric flow rate increases because density decreases more rapidly than mass flow in some regimes. However, the key is that at the highest altitude (lowest ambient density), the air density is minimal. To maintain adequate residence time for complete combustion (to prevent blowout and ensure high combustion efficiency), the combustor must be sized for the condition where the volumetric flow rate per unit mass is highest, i.e., at the lowest density. Since the aircraft can attain 11 km altitude, that is the maximum altitude, and thus the combustor volume must be decided based on conditions at 11 km to ensure proper operation throughout the flight envelope."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of a combustor in a gas turbine engine. It must mix fuel and air and burn efficiently within a limited space, requiring sufficient residence time.",
          "Step 2: Recall that residence time depends on combustor volume and volumetric flow rate of air. Residence time $\\tau \\approx V_{\\text{comb}} / \\dot{V}$.",
          "Step 3: Volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V} = \\dot{m}_a / \\rho$. For a given engine cycle, the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_a$ is typically sized to meet thrust requirements at various conditions. However, air density $\\rho$ decreases significantly with altitude.",
          "Step 4: At higher altitudes (e.g., 11 km), air density is much lower than at sea level. Even if mass flow is reduced, the volumetric flow rate for a given mass flow is inversely proportional to density, so it is highest at the lowest density condition.",
          "Step 5: To ensure that the residence time is adequate even at the condition of highest volumetric flow rate (i.e., lowest density), the combustor volume must be designed based on that extreme condition. Otherwise, at high altitude, residence time may be too short, leading to incomplete combustion, blowout, or reduced efficiency.",
          "Step 6: Therefore, for an aircraft that can reach 11 km altitude, the combustor volume is decided based on conditions at 11 km (maximum altitude) to guarantee performance across the entire operational envelope."
