        "reasoning": "The combustor's primary function is to efficiently and stably burn fuel with air. The most challenging condition for combustion is typically at the highest altitude where the aircraft operates. At higher altitudes (like 11 km), the ambient atmospheric pressure and temperature are significantly lower, leading to a much lower air density (as indicated by RAG Chunk 2, 'Thrust typically decreases at altitude due to lower air density'). Lower air density means less oxygen is available per unit volume for combustion. To ensure complete combustion and maintain flame stability under these oxygen-lean, low-pressure conditions, the fuel-air mixture requires a longer residence time within the combustor. Therefore, the combustor volume must be sized to accommodate these most demanding conditions. If the combustor is designed to operate effectively and stably at the maximum altitude (11 km), it will inherently be capable of performing at lower altitudes where air density is higher and combustion is generally easier to sustain."

          "Step 3: Recall how atmospheric properties change with altitude. As altitude increases, both ambient pressure and temperature decrease, leading to a substantial reduction in air density ($\\rho = P/(RT)$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the impact of lower air density on the combustion process. Lower air density means less oxygen is available per unit volume for the chemical reaction. This makes it more difficult to achieve complete combustion and maintain a stable flame.",
          "Step 5: Determine the critical design condition for the combustor. To ensure reliable engine operation across the entire flight envelope, the combustor must be designed for the most challenging conditions. The lowest air density (highest altitude) presents the most demanding environment for achieving stable and efficient combustion, often requiring a longer residence time for the fuel-air mixture.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that the combustor volume is decided based on the maximum altitude the aircraft can attain (11 km in this case), as this condition dictates the minimum required volume for proper combustion."
