        "reasoning": "The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients: $$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 2\\frac{dy}{dt} + y = 0$$To solve this, we first form the characteristic equation by replacing $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$ with $r^2$, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ with $r$, and $y$ with $1$:$$r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$$This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:$$(r - 1)^2 = 0$$This yields repeated real roots: $r_1 = r_2 = 1$.For repeated real roots $r$, the general solution of a homogeneous linear ODE is of the form:$$y(t) = (C_1 + C_2t)e^{rt}$$Substituting $r=1$ into the general solution, we get:$$y(t) = (C_1 + C_2t)e^t$$Next, we need to apply the initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 1$ to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.First, apply $y(0) = 0$:$$y(0) = (C_1 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^0$$$$0 = (C_1 + 0) \\cdot 1$$$$C_1 = 0$$Now, we need to find the first derivative of $y(t)$ with respect to $t$:$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}((C_1 + C_2t)e^t)$$Using the product rule $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$ where $u = C_1 + C_2t$ and $v = e^t$:$$u' = C_2$$$$v' = e^t$$So,$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = C_2e^t + (C_1 + C_2t)e^t$$Factor out $e^t$:$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = (C_1 + C_2 + C_2t)e^t$$Now, apply the second initial condition $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 1$:$$\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = (C_1 + C_2 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^0$$$$1 = (C_1 + C_2 + 0) \\cdot 1$$$$1 = C_1 + C_2$$Since we found $C_1 = 0$ from the first initial condition, substitute this value:$$1 = 0 + C_2$$$$C_2 = 1$$Substitute the values of $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = 1$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution:$$y(t) = (0 + 1 \\cdot t)e^t$$$$y(t) = te^t$$Finally, we need to find the value of $y(1)$:$$y(1) = 1 \\cdot e^1$$$$y(1) = e$$This matches option A."

          "Step 3: Solve the characteristic equation for its roots. The equation factors as $(r-1)^2 = 0$, indicating repeated real roots $r_1 = r_2 = 1$.",

          "Step 7: Apply the second initial condition, $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 1$, to find $C_2$. Substitute $t=0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}=1$ into the derivative expression: $1 = (C_1 + C_2 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^0 \\implies 1 = C_1 + C_2$. Since $C_1=0$, we get $C_2 = 1$.",

This reinforces the importance of using initial conditions to find a unique solution. However, the RAG did not contain specific formulas or detailed methods for solving second-order linear homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients and repeated roots, which was the core mathematical technique required for this problem. The solution relied primarily on standard ODE solving techniques from internal knowledge."
