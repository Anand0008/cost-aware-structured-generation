However, none specifically covered solving second-order linear ODEs with constant coefficients or the characteristic equation method. The RAG context was about first-order ODEs and general definitions. Therefore, internal knowledge was used for the solution. Relevance is moderate because the concepts of IVP and ODEs are related, but the specific solution technique was not in RAG."
