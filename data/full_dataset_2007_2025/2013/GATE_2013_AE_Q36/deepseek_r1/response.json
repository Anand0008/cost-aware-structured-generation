The oncoming flow is given as steady, irrotational, and incompressible, but around the cylinder, due to curvature and viscous effects near the surface, the flow becomes rotational. Points 3 and 4 are on the cylinder surface at different locations and are not on the same streamline. In this rotational region, Bernoulli's constant may differ between streamlines, so Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied between points 3 and 4. For other pairs: points 1 and 2 are on the same streamline far away where flow is irrotational; points 1 and 5 can be connected along a streamline; points 5 and 6 are likely on the same streamline or in a region where flow is approximately irrotational, allowing Bernoulli's application."
