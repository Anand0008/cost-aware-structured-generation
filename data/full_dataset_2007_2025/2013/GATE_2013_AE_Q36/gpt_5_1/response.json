        "reasoning": "The oncoming flow is stated to be steady, irrotational and incompressible. Around the cylinder, outside the separated wake, the flow remains inviscid and irrotational so Bernoulli\\'s equation with a single constant is valid everywhere in that outer potential-flow region and along any streamline there. Points 1, 2, 5, and 6 clearly lie on these smooth outer streamlines. Downstream of the cylinder, the figure shows a wake with several recirculating eddies between the shear layers; this region is rotational and highly viscous. Points 3 and 4 are inside this separated wake, on different streamlines within a rotational flow. In rotational flow, Bernoulli\\'s constant is not the same between different streamlines; Bernoulli can only be applied along a single streamline, not between two arbitrary points on different streamlines. Therefore Bernoulli\\'s equation cannot be applied between 3 and 4. Between 1 and 2, 1 and 5, and 5 and 6, the flow is irrotational potential flow, so Bernoulli with a single constant is applicable between those points. Hence option C is correct."
