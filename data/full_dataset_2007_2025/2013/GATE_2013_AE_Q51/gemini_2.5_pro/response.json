        "reasoning": "The question asks for the nozzle exit Mach number that yields the highest thrust, given that the nozzle is choked and 'always under-expanded'.\n\n1.  **Thrust Equation**: The total thrust ($F$) from a jet engine nozzle is given by $F = \\dot{m} (V_e - V_a) + (P_e - P_a) A_e$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, $V_e$ is the exit velocity, $V_a$ is the flight velocity, $P_e$ is the exit static pressure, $P_a$ is the ambient static pressure, and $A_e$ is the exit area. The term $\\dot{m} (V_e - V_a)$ is the momentum thrust, and $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ is the pressure thrust.\n\n2.  **Choked Nozzle**: For a choked nozzle, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is constant for given stagnation conditions and throat area. The flight velocity ($V_a$) is also constant (derived from $M_a = 1.5$ and $T_{ambient} = 250$ K).\n\n3.  **Under-expanded Nozzle**: The problem states the nozzle is 'always under-expanded'. This means that for all given exit Mach numbers ($M_e = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5$), the exit static pressure ($P_e$) is greater than the ambient static pressure ($P_a$) (i.e., $P_e > P_a$). Consequently, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ is always positive and contributes to the total thrust.\n\n4.  **Thrust Optimization**: The maximum possible thrust for a given mass flow rate occurs when the nozzle is 'perfectly expanded', meaning the exit static pressure exactly equals the ambient static pressure ($P_e = P_a$). At this condition, the pressure thrust term is zero, and the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) is maximized for the given expansion.\n\n5.  **Effect of Increasing $M_e$ in Under-expanded Regime**: If a nozzle is under-expanded ($P_e > P_a$), it means the flow has not expanded enough to reach the optimal condition. To increase thrust, the flow needs to be expanded further. Increasing the exit Mach number ($M_e$) (which implies increasing the nozzle's expansion ratio, $A_e/A^*$) leads to:\n    *   An increase in exit velocity ($V_e$), thus increasing the momentum thrust component $\\dot{m} (V_e - V_a)$.\n    *   A decrease in exit static pressure ($P_e$), bringing it closer to $P_a$.\n    *   An increase in exit area ($A_e$).\n\n    As long as the nozzle remains under-expanded ($P_e > P_a$), further expansion (i.e., increasing $M_e$) will increase the total thrust, moving it closer to the maximum possible thrust at $P_e = P_a$. Since all options are stated to be under-expanded, the highest exit Mach number (2.5) represents the greatest expansion among the choices and will therefore yield the highest thrust."

          "Step 2: Interpret the given conditions: 'choked' implies constant mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) for fixed stagnation conditions and throat area. 'Always under-expanded' implies that for all given exit Mach numbers, $P_e > P_a$, meaning the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ is always positive.",
          "Step 3: Recall the condition for maximum thrust: Maximum thrust occurs when the nozzle is perfectly expanded, i.e., $P_e = P_a$. At this point, the pressure thrust term is zero, and the exhaust velocity is maximized for the given expansion.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of increasing exit Mach number ($M_e$) on thrust in an under-expanded regime. For an under-expanded nozzle, the flow has not expanded enough. Increasing $M_e$ (by increasing the nozzle's expansion ratio) leads to a higher exit velocity ($V_e$) and a lower exit pressure ($P_e$), moving the nozzle closer to the perfectly expanded condition.",
          "Step 5: Conclude that for an under-expanded nozzle, increasing the exit Mach number (and thus the expansion) will increase the total thrust until the perfectly expanded condition ($P_e = P_a$) is reached. Since the problem states that the nozzle is 'always under-expanded' for the given options, the highest $M_e$ (2.5) will correspond to the greatest expansion and thus the highest thrust among the choices.",
          "Step 6: Compare the given options (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5). Based on the analysis, the highest Mach number, 2.5, will provide the highest thrust."
