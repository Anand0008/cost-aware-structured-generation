        "reasoning": "For a given engine with fixed stagnation temperature and mass flow rate, the nozzle is always choked and underexpanded. As exit Mach number increases, the jet velocity increases, so the momentum thrust term \\(\\dot{m}(V_e - V_0)\\) increases. The pressure thrust term \\((p_e - p_0)A_e\\) is positive for underexpanded flow and, for the range of Mach numbers given, does not decrease enough to offset the gain in momentum thrust. Therefore, thrust is a monotonically increasing function of exit Mach number over the options 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, so the highest Mach number (2.5) gives the highest thrust. This is consistent with standard thrust expression for jet/rocket nozzles and with the common result that, for fixed flight speed, higher jet speed yields higher thrust (though with lower propulsive efficiency, which was the focus of the previous linked question)."
