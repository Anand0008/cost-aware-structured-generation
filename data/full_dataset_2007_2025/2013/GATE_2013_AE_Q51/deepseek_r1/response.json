        "reasoning": "For a choked nozzle with fixed stagnation conditions (stagnation temperature T0=800 K, assumed fixed stagnation pressure P0) and fixed ambient pressure Pa (implied by flight at Mach 1.5 and ambient temperature 250 K, though exact value not needed), the thrust F = ṁ * V_e + (P_e - P_a) * A_e increases with exit Mach number M_e in the under-expanded regime (P_e > P_a). As M_e increases, the momentum thrust (ṁ * V_e) increases, and although the pressure thrust ((P_e - P_a) * A_e) decreases, the net effect is an increase in total thrust. Numerical evaluation with typical P_a/P0 ratios (e.g., 0.04) confirms that F is highest at M_e = 2.5 among the given options (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5)."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify given data and assumptions. Aircraft flight Mach M_flight = 1.5, ambient temperature T_a = 250 K, stagnation temperature at nozzle entry T0 = 800 K. Nozzle is choked and always under-expanded (exit pressure P_e > ambient pressure P_a). Exhaust gas properties: molecular weight MW = 29, ratio of specific heats γ = 1.4, universal gas constant R_univ = 8314 J/kmol-K. Gas constant R = R_univ/MW = 8314/29 ≈ 286.69 J/kg-K.",
          "Step 2: Recall thrust equation for a nozzle. Thrust F = ṁ * V_e + (P_e - P_a) * A_e, where ṁ is mass flow rate (fixed because nozzle is choked, throat area fixed), V_e is exit velocity, P_e is exit static pressure, P_a is ambient pressure, A_e is exit area.",
          "Step 3: Express parameters in terms of exit Mach number M_e using isentropic relations (since flow is isentropic up to exit for under-expanded case, no internal shocks). Exit temperature: T_e = T0 / (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_e^2). Exit velocity: V_e = M_e * sqrt(γ * R * T_e). Exit pressure: P_e = P0 / (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_e^2)^{γ/(γ-1)}. Exit area ratio: A_e/A_throat = (1/M_e) * ((1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_e^2) / ((γ+1)/2))^{(γ+1)/(2(γ-1))}. Mass flow rate: ṁ = (P0 * A_throat / sqrt(T0)) * sqrt(γ/R) * ((γ+1)/2)^{-(γ+1)/(2(γ-1))}, constant for fixed P0, T0, A_throat.",
          "Step 4: Note that P0 (stagnation pressure) and P_a are not explicitly given. However, the condition 'always under-expanded' means P_e > P_a for all M_e considered. This implies P_a is less than the smallest P_e among the options, which occurs at M_e = 2.5. Thus, choose a plausible P_a/P0 ratio (e.g., 0.04) that satisfies P_e(M_e) > P_a for all M_e. Thrust comparison is qualitatively insensitive to the exact value as long as under-expansion holds.",
          "Step 5: Compute non-dimensional thrust F* = F/(P0 A_throat) for each M_e (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5) using the expressions from Step 3. With γ = 1.4 and chosen P_a/P0 = 0.04, calculations yield: F*(1) ≈ 1.228, F*(1.5) ≈ 1.282, F*(2) ≈ 1.356, F*(2.5) ≈ 1.399. Thus, thrust increases with M_e, and M_e = 2.5 gives the highest thrust.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that higher exit Mach number results in higher thrust for an under-expanded choked nozzle under the given conditions, because the increase in momentum thrust outweighs the decrease in pressure thrust."
