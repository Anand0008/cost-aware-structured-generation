          "Step 2: Formulate the condition as a compound inequality. \"Velocity between $32 \\text{ m/sec}$ and $64 \\text{ m/sec}$\" means $32 < V < 64$.",
          "Step 3: Substitute the given velocity function into the inequality: $32 < 80 - 32t < 64$.",
          "Step 4: Split the compound inequality into two simpler linear inequalities: (a) $32 < 80 - 32t$ and (b) $80 - 32t < 64$.",
          "Step 5: Solve the first inequality (a): $32 < 80 - 32t$. Add $32t$ to both sides and subtract $32$ from both sides: $32t < 80 - 32 \\implies 32t < 48$. Divide by $32$: $t < \\frac{48}{32} \\implies t < \\frac{3}{2}$.",
          "Step 6: Solve the second inequality (b): $80 - 32t < 64$. Add $32t$ to both sides and subtract $64$ from both sides: $80 - 64 < 32t \\implies 16 < 32t$. Divide by $32$: $\\frac{16}{32} < t \\implies \\frac{1}{2} < t$.",
          "Step 7: Combine the solutions from both inequalities. From Step 5, $t < \\frac{3}{2}$, and from Step 6, $t > \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the combined interval is $\\frac{1}{2} < t < \\frac{3}{2}$.",
