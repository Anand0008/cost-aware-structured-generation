        "notes": "RAG context provided highly relevant information on gliding flight, maximum range, drag polar, and formulas for (L/D)_max. It included worked examples and key formulas. However, a critical discrepancy was noted in the video chunk: the lecturer incorrectly stated C_L = C_D0/K for max range, whereas the correct condition is C_L = sqrt(C_D0/K). The analysis relied on the correct textbook-derived formulas from the RAG book chunks and internal knowledge to resolve this."
