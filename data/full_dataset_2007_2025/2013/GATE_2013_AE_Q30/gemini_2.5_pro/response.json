Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 contained the exact formulas and conditions needed for calculating the induced drag factor, lift coefficient for maximum L/D, the maximum L/D ratio itself, and the final maximum gliding range. Chunk 5 offered good conceptual background. The critical discrepancy noted in RAG chunks 1 and 2 regarding $C_L = C_{D0}/K$ vs. $C_L = \\sqrt{C_{D0}/K}$ was very helpful in identifying a potential common mistake and reinforcing the correct derivation."
