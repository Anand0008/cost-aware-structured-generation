        "reasoning": "In an ideal ramjet, the diffuser (intake) and nozzle are modeled as isentropic devices. For isentropic flow of a perfect gas with no shaft work or heat transfer, the stagnation temperature T0 remains constant. Thus, through the intake and nozzle, T0 is constant. In the combustor, heat is added at (ideally) constant pressure, which increases the stagnation temperature from T01 to T02. Therefore, the correct axial variation is: constant T0 in intake, a jump (increase) across the combustor, and then constant T0 in the nozzle. Graph (B) shows exactly this behavior: flat in intake, sharp rise in combustor, flat in nozzle. Other options either show T0 changing in intake/nozzle or not increasing properly in the combustor, which contradicts ideal ramjet assumptions."
