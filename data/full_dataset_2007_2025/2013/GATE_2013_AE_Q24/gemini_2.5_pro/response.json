        "reasoning": "In an ideal ramjet engine, the variation of stagnation temperature ($T_0$) along its axis is governed by the thermodynamic processes occurring in each component:\n\n1.  **Intake (Diffuser):** The air enters the diffuser and undergoes isentropic compression, where its velocity decreases, and static pressure and temperature increase. In an ideal isentropic and adiabatic process (no heat transfer, no work done), the total energy of the flow remains constant. Stagnation temperature is a measure of this total energy. Therefore, in an ideal diffuser, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant.\n\n2.  **Combustor:** In the combustor, fuel is injected and burned, adding a significant amount of heat to the air. This heat addition directly increases the total energy of the flow. Consequently, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) increases sharply in the combustor.\n\n3.  **Nozzle:** The hot, high-pressure gases from the combustor expand through the nozzle to accelerate and produce thrust. This expansion is also assumed to be ideal, isentropic, and adiabatic. Similar to the diffuser, in an ideal isentropic and adiabatic process, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant as the thermal energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nGraph B accurately depicts this behavior: constant $T_0$ in the Intake, a sharp rise in the Combustor, and constant $T_0$ again in the Nozzle."

          "**Step 2: Analyze the stagnation temperature variation in the Intake (Diffuser).** In an ideal ramjet, the diffuser is assumed to perform isentropic compression. For an ideal isentropic and adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer to or from the system, and no work is done. Under these conditions, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$), which represents the total energy of the flow, remains constant.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the stagnation temperature variation in the Combustor.** The primary function of the combustor is to add heat to the air by burning fuel. This heat addition directly increases the total energy of the gas stream. Therefore, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) increases significantly within the combustor.",
          "**Step 4: Analyze the stagnation temperature variation in the Nozzle.** The nozzle's role is to expand the hot gases isentropically to convert their thermal energy into kinetic energy, generating thrust. Similar to the diffuser, an ideal isentropic and adiabatic expansion process conserves the total energy of the flow. Hence, the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant through the nozzle.",
          "**Step 5: Compare the derived behavior with the given graphs.** Based on the analysis, the stagnation temperature should be constant in the intake, increase in the combustor, and remain constant in the nozzle. Graph B perfectly matches this description."
