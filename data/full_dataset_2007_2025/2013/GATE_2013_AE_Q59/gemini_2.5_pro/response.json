For proper parallel structure, all items in a list should be in the same grammatical form. 'Mechanics' and 'mathematics' are both single nouns. However, 'how to do computation' is a noun phrase (specifically, an embedded question or a nominal clause acting as a noun) that breaks this parallelism. To maintain parallel structure, it should be a single noun like 'computation' or 'computations', or a gerund like 'computing'. Therefore, part IV ('how to do computation') is not appropriate."

          "Step 5: Identify the inconsistency. The first two items are single nouns, while the third is a more complex phrase. This breaks the parallel structure.",
          "Step 6: Conclude the inappropriate part. The phrase 'how to do computation' (part IV) is not parallel with the preceding nouns, making it the inappropriate part."
