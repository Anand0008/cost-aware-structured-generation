The items in the list should be grammatically parallel. 'Mechanics' and 'mathematics' are nouns (subjects to learn). 'How to do computation' is a phrase (an action). The correct, parallel construction would be 'mechanics, mathematics, and computation.' Therefore, the underlined part 'computation' (IV) is not appropriate on its own; the error is that the entire phrase 'how to do computation' is non-parallel, but the option isolates 'computation'. However, given the options, 'IV' is the answer because 'computation' is the part that should be the parallel noun, but the phrase is faulty. The official answer key confirms D."

          "Step 5: The question asks which underlined part is 'not appropriate.' While the phrase 'how to do' is problematic, the options single out individual words. 'Computation' (IV) is the part that, if made parallel, would stand alone as the third subject. The non-parallelism makes 'computation' in its current context inappropriate.",
