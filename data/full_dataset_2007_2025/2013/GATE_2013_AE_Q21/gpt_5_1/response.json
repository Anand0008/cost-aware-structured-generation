        "reasoning": "Fuel added in the combustor is determined by the temperature rise required from compressor exit temperature T_03 to turbine inlet temperature T_04. For fixed inlet conditions and fixed T_04, the fuel requirement is proportional to (T_04 - T_03). A less efficient compressor (lower isentropic efficiency) requires more work and therefore produces a higher exit temperature T_03 for the same pressure ratio. This reduces the temperature rise needed in the combustor and hence reduces the fuel required. Among the options, the lowest compressor efficiency (0.8) gives the highest T_03 and thus the lowest fuel addition, so option D is consistent with the thermodynamic reasoning, even though it is counter‑intuitive from a cycle-efficiency standpoint."

          "Step 3: For a given pressure ratio, a compressor with lower isentropic efficiency has higher exit temperature T_03, since more work is put into the air for the same pressure rise.",

RAG did not directly address this exact conceptual GATE question but contained all necessary background."
