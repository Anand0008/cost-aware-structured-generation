Actual outlet temperature T02 = T01 + (T02s - T01)/η_c, where η_c is the isentropic compressor efficiency. A lower η_c results in a higher T02. Since the turbine inlet temperature (T03) is fixed, the heat addition required in the combustor, Q_in ≈ Cp*(T03 - T02), decreases as T02 increases. Therefore, the lowest compressor efficiency (0.8) yields the highest T02 and thus the lowest fuel requirement. The RAG context (Chunk 1) confirms that an inefficient compressor leads to a higher-than-ideal exit temperature for the same pressure rise."
