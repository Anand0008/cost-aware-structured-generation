        "reasoning": "For a given inlet condition ($T_{01}$) and a fixed turbine inlet temperature ($T_{04}$), the amount of fuel added in the combustor is primarily determined by the temperature rise required from the combustor, which is $(T_{04} - T_{03})$. To achieve the lowest amount of fuel added, this temperature difference must be minimized. Since $T_{04}$ is fixed, we need to maximize $T_{03}$ (the compressor outlet temperature).\n\nThe actual compressor outlet temperature $T_{03}$ is related to the isentropic compressor outlet temperature $T_{02s}$ and the compressor isentropic efficiency $\\eta_c$ by the formula:\n$T_{03} = T_{01} + \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{\\eta_c}$\n\nAssuming a fixed pressure ratio (implied by 'given inlet condition' and a specific engine cycle), $T_{01}$ and $T_{02s}$ are constant. Therefore, the term $(T_{02s} - T_{01})$ is a fixed positive value. From the equation, as $\\eta_c$ decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, causing the term $\\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{\\eta_c}$ to increase. This leads to a higher actual compressor outlet temperature $T_{03}$.\n\nThus, to maximize $T_{03}$, the compressor efficiency $\\eta_c$ must be the lowest. Among the given options (1, 0.95, 0.85, 0.8), 0.8 is the lowest efficiency. This counter-intuitive result means a less efficient compressor, by heating the air more due to irreversibilities for the same pressure ratio, reduces the additional heat required from the fuel to reach the fixed turbine inlet temperature."

          "Step 1: Understand the objective. The goal is to find the compressor efficiency that leads to the lowest amount of fuel added in the combustor.",

          "Step 3: Identify fixed parameters. The question states that the turbine inlet temperature ($T_{04}$) is fixed, and the inlet conditions ($T_{01}$) are given (implying fixed $T_{01}$ and $P_{01}$). For a given engine, the compressor pressure ratio is also typically fixed.",
          "Step 4: Determine the implication for $T_{03}$. Since $T_{04}$ is fixed, minimizing $(T_{04} - T_{03})$ requires maximizing $T_{03}$ (the compressor outlet temperature).",
          "Step 5: Relate compressor efficiency ($\\eta_c$) to $T_{03}$. The actual compressor outlet temperature $T_{03}$ is related to the isentropic outlet temperature $T_{02s}$ and compressor efficiency by the formula: $T_{03} = T_{01} + \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{\\eta_c}$.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the effect of $\\eta_c$ on $T_{03}$. For fixed $T_{01}$ and $T_{02s}$ (which is fixed for a given pressure ratio), as $\\eta_c$ decreases, the denominator of the fraction decreases. This causes the term $\\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{\\eta_c}$ to increase, leading to a higher actual compressor outlet temperature $T_{03}$.",
          "Step 7: Conclude based on the options. To maximize $T_{03}$ (and thus minimize fuel), the compressor efficiency $\\eta_c$ must be the lowest. Among the given options (1, 0.95, 0.85, 0.8), 0.8 is the lowest value."
