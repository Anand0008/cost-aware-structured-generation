        "reasoning": "The correct answer is D, 0.8. This is because a lower compressor efficiency (0.8) leads to a higher compressor work input, which in turn requires more fuel to be added in the combustor to achieve the same turbine inlet temperature. The higher fuel flow rate is needed to compensate for the less efficient compression process."

          "The additional work input from the turbine must be provided by burning more fuel in the combustor.",
          "This increased fuel flow rate is needed to raise the air temperature from the compressor exit (T02) to the turbine inlet temperature (T03), which is fixed at 1350 K.",
