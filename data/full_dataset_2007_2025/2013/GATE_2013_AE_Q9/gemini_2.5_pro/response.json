        "reasoning": "The Phugoid mode is a long-period, lightly damped oscillation involving an exchange between kinetic and potential energy, leading to coupled variations in speed and altitude. The natural frequency of the Phugoid mode, $\\omega_{n_P}$, can be derived using approximations for steady, level flight and neglecting the change in lift coefficient with speed ($C_{L_u} \\approx 0$). The simplified formula for the Phugoid natural frequency is given by: \\n\\n$\\omega_{n_P} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1}$ \\n\\nWhere: \\n- $\\omega_{n_P}$ is the Phugoid natural frequency (rad/s) \\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s$^2$) \\n- $U_1$ is the equilibrium flight speed (m/s) \\n\\nFrom this formula, it is clear that the Phugoid natural frequency ($\\omega_{n_P}$) is inversely proportional to the equilibrium flight speed ($U_1$). As flight speed increases, the Phugoid frequency decreases, meaning the period of oscillation increases. Therefore, option B is the correct statement."
