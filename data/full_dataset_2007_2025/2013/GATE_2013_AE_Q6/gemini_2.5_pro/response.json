        "reasoning": "The 'Artificial Horizon', also known as the Attitude Indicator, is the flight instrument specifically designed to provide a visual representation of the aircraft's pitch and roll angles relative to a simulated horizon. This directly indicates the aircraft's attitude in flight. The retrieved knowledge consistently defines the attitude indicator as providing pitch ($\\\\theta$) and roll ($\\\\phi$) angles, which constitute the aircraft's attitude. Other options like the Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) measure rate of climb/descent, the Altimeter measures altitude, and the Turn-bank indicator shows turn rate and slip/skid, none of which primarily determine the overall pitch and roll attitude."

          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A, Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI). The VSI measures the rate at which the aircraft is climbing or descending (vertical speed), not its orientation.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B, Altimeter. The altimeter measures the aircraft's height above a reference level (altitude), not its orientation.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C, Artificial Horizon. The Artificial Horizon, also known as the Attitude Indicator, provides a visual display of the aircraft's pitch and roll angles relative to the horizon. This directly indicates the aircraft's attitude.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D, Turn-bank indicator. The turn-bank indicator shows the rate of turn and whether the aircraft is in a coordinated turn (slip or skid), which is related to yaw and roll rate, but it is not the primary instrument for displaying the aircraft's absolute pitch and roll attitude.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that the Artificial Horizon is the correct instrument for determining the aircraft's attitude in flight."
