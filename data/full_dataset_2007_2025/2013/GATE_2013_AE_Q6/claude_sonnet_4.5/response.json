The artificial horizon, also known as the attitude indicator, is the primary flight instrument used to determine the aircraft's attitude in flight. It provides a visual representation of the aircraft's pitch and roll relative to the horizon. The other options are not used to directly determine the aircraft's attitude: the vertical speed indicator (VSI) shows the rate of climb/descent, the altimeter shows the aircraft's altitude, and the turn-bank indicator shows the aircraft's rate of turn and bank angle."
