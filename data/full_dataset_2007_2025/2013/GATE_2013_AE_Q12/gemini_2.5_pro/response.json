This is a fundamental result from fluid kinematics, specifically derived from the principle of mass conservation for a fluid particle.\n\n1.  **Mass of a fluid element:** Consider an elemental volume $\\delta \\vartheta$ of fluid with density $\\rho$. The mass of this element is $\\delta m = \\rho \\delta \\vartheta$.\n2.  **Conservation of mass for a fluid particle:** For a fluid particle (or element), its mass remains constant as it moves with the flow. Therefore, the substantial derivative of its mass is zero:\n    $\\frac{D(\\delta m)}{Dt} = 0$\n3.  **Applying the substantial derivative:** Substitute $\\delta m = \\rho \\delta \\vartheta$ into the equation:\n    $\\frac{D(\\rho \\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0$\n    Using the product rule for the substantial derivative:\n    $\\delta \\vartheta \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0$\n4.  **Rearranging the equation:** Divide the entire equation by $\\rho \\delta \\vartheta$ (assuming both are non-zero):\n    $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0 \\quad (Equation\\ 1)$\n5.  **Continuity equation in differential form:** The general continuity equation for a compressible flow (in Eulerian form) is:\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\vec{V}) = 0$\n    Expanding the divergence term using the product rule:\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) = 0$\n    Recognize that $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho$ is the substantial derivative of density, $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$.\n    So, the continuity equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) = 0$\n6.  **Rearranging the continuity equation:** Divide by $\\rho$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0 \\quad (Equation\\ 2)$\n7.  **Comparing equations:** From Equation 1 and Equation 2, we can equate the terms involving $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$\n    And\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$\n    Therefore, we conclude:\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt}$\n\nThis matches option A."

          "Step 1: Understand the physical context. The question describes an elemental volume $\\delta \\vartheta$ of a compressible fluid moving with velocity $\\vec{V}$. We need to find a relationship involving the divergence of velocity and the rate of change of this volume.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of mass for a fluid element. The mass of the elemental volume is given by $\\delta m = \\rho \\delta \\vartheta$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density.",
          "Step 3: Apply the principle of mass conservation for a fluid particle. For a specific fluid particle (which the elemental volume represents), its mass remains constant as it moves. Therefore, the substantial derivative of its mass must be zero: $\\frac{D(\\delta m)}{Dt} = 0$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the mass definition and apply the product rule for the substantial derivative. Replace $\\delta m$ with $\\rho \\delta \\vartheta$: $\\frac{D(\\rho \\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0$. Expanding this using the product rule gives: $\\delta \\vartheta \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0$.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the equation from Step 4 to isolate the term involving the rate of change of volume. Divide by $\\rho \\delta \\vartheta$: $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = 0$. This implies $\\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$.",
          "Step 6: Recall the continuity equation in its differential form for compressible flow. The continuity equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\vec{V}) = 0$.",
          "Step 7: Express the continuity equation in terms of the substantial derivative of density. Expand $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\vec{V})$ as $\\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V})$. The continuity equation becomes $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) = 0$. Recognize that $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho = \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$. So, $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) = 0$.",
          "Step 8: Rearrange the continuity equation from Step 7 to relate $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}$ to the substantial derivative of density. Divide by $\\rho$: $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0$. This implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$.",
          "Step 9: Compare the results from Step 5 and Step 8. Both expressions are equal to $- \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$. Therefore, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\vartheta} \\frac{D(\\delta \\vartheta)}{Dt}$. This matches option A."

While the exact formula in option A was not explicitly stated, the provided context was highly relevant and sufficient to derive the correct answer by combining these fundamental principles. The RAG content was helpful in confirming the starting points for the derivation."
