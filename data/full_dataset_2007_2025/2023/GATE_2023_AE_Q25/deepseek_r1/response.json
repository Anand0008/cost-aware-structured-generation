This is a fundamental principle of linear differential equations, confirmed by RAG chunks 2, 3, 4, and 5. Option B is true: In all damped systems (under-, critically, and over-damped), the transient free vibration response decays exponentially to zero. Damping ensures decay; the distinction is the rate and nature of decay (oscillatory or non-oscillatory). Option C is false: The steady-state response is solely determined by the forcing function and system parameters (m, c, k). It is independent of initial conditions, as stated in RAG chunk 4. Option D is true: The decay rate of the transient response is governed by the damping ratio \\(\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{m k}}\\), which depends on m, c, and k. The exponential decay term is \\(e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t}\\), where \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}\\)."

          "Step 3: Analyze the transient response. The complementary solution is of the form \\(x_c(t) = e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t}[A \\cos(\\omega_d t) + B \\sin(\\omega_d t)]\\) for under-damped systems, with analogous forms for critically and over-damped.

Also, \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}\\), so the damping ratio \\(\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{m k}}\\) depends on m, c, and k. Hence, statement D is true."
