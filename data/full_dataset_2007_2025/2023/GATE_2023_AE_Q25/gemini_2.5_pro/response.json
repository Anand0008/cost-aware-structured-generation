        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements regarding harmonically excited forced vibration of a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) linear spring-mass-damper system. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: The total response of the mass is a combination of free vibration transient and steady-state response.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. As per fundamental vibration theory and explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the total response of a forced vibration system is the sum of the homogeneous solution (free vibration, transient) and the particular solution (forced vibration, steady-state). Mathematically, $x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t)$, where $x_c(t)$ is the complementary function (transient) and $x_p(t)$ is the particular integral (steady-state).\n\n**Option B: The free vibration transient dies out with time for each of the three possible conditions of damping (under-damped, critically damped, and over-damped).**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The transient response is characterized by an exponential decay term, $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$, which causes it to diminish over time. This exponential decay factor is present for all positive damping ratios ($\\zeta > 0$), which covers under-damped ($\\zeta < 1$), critically damped ($\\zeta = 1$), and over-damped ($\\zeta > 1$) conditions. In all these cases, as $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} \\to 0$, meaning the transient response dies out. This is supported by RAG Chunks 2 and 4.\n\n**Option C: The steady-state periodic response is dependent on the initial conditions at the time of application of external forcing.**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The steady-state response (particular integral) is solely dependent on the system parameters (mass, stiffness, damping) and the characteristics of the forcing function (amplitude, frequency). It is independent of the initial conditions (initial displacement and velocity). The initial conditions only affect the constants of integration in the transient response. This is clearly stated in RAG Chunks 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Option D: The rate of decay of free vibration transient response depends on the mass, spring stiffness and damping constant.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The rate of decay of the transient response is governed by the exponential term $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$. The decay constant is $\\zeta\\omega_n$. We know that the damping ratio $\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{mk}}$ and the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$. Therefore, the product $\\zeta\\omega_n = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{mk}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\frac{c}{2m}$. This shows that the rate of decay depends on the damping constant ($c$) and the mass ($m$). Since $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$ both depend on $m$, $k$, and $c$, the rate of decay is indeed a function of mass, spring stiffness, and damping constant. This is consistent with the formulas for transient response provided in RAG Chunks 2 and 4.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A, B, and D are true."
