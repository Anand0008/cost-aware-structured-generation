With any nonzero damping (under-, critical, or over-damped), the homogeneous solution contains an exponential decay factor, so the free vibration transient always dies out with time in all three damping cases, making B correct. The steady-state periodic response is determined only by the forcing amplitude and frequency and the system parameters (m, c, k); it is independent of initial conditions, so statement C is false. The rate of decay of the transient is governed by the damping ratio and natural frequency, which depend on m, k, and c, so D is correct.

These directly supported the explanation that total response is transient plus steady-state, that damping causes decay of the transient, and that steady-state persists. The key idea that initial conditions affect only the transient is also explicitly mentioned. Overall, RAG was highly relevant and aligned with standard textbook theory."
