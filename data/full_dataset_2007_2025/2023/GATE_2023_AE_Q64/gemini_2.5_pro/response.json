        "reasoning": "The calculation, based on the explicitly stated 'polytropic efficiency' of 0.8, results in an impeller speed of 15287 RPM. The provided answer key range (15948 to 16048) is significantly higher. If the answer key range is considered correct, it implies an effective efficiency of approximately 0.752 (whether polytropic or isentropic), rather than the given 0.8. Since the problem statement must be followed, the calculated value of 15287 RPM is derived directly from the given parameters and standard turbomachinery principles. Therefore, the calculated answer does not fall within the provided range, leading to 'is_correct: false' relative to the given range, but the calculation itself is robust based on the problem statement."
