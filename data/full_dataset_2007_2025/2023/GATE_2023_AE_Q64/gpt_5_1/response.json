        "reasoning": "We use the polytropic relation for a compressor to find the stagnation temperature rise corresponding to the given pressure ratio and polytropic efficiency, then equate this to the specific work from the Euler turbomachine equation including slip factor. Finally, we relate impeller tip speed to RPM using the given outlet diameter.\\n\\n1) Polytropic temperature ratio:\\nGiven pressure ratio $r_p = p_{02}/p_{01} = 5$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, polytropic efficiency $\\eta_p = 0.8$. For a compressor, the polytropic relation is\\n$$\\frac{T_{02}}{T_{01}} = r_p^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma\\eta_p}}$$\\nCompute exponent: $(\\gamma-1)/(\\gamma\\eta_p) = 0.4/(1.4\\times0.8) = 0.4/1.12 \\approx 0.3571$.\\nThen $T_{01} = 25^\\circ C = 298\\,\\text{K}$, so\\n$T_{02}/T_{01} = 5^{0.3571} \\approx e^{0.3571\\ln 5}$. With $\\ln 5 \\approx 1.6094$, exponent $\\approx 0.3571\\times1.6094 \\approx 0.574$, so $T_{02}/T_{01} \\approx e^{0.574} \\approx 1.776$.\\nThus $T_{02} \\approx 1.776\\times298 \\approx 529.8\\,\\text{K}$ and $\\Delta T_0 = T_{02}-T_{01} \\approx 231.8\\,\\text{K}$.\\n\\n2) Specific work from thermodynamics:\\nWith $C_p = 1.004\\,\\text{kJ/kg-K} = 1004\\,\\text{J/kg-K}$,\\n$$w = C_p\\Delta T_0 \\approx 1004\\times231.8 \\approx 2.33\\times10^5\\,\\text{J/kg}$$\\n\\n3) Relate work to impeller tip speed including slip:\\nFor a radial-flow centrifugal compressor with negligible inlet whirl, the ideal specific work is $w_{ideal} = U_2^2$. With slip factor $\\mu$, the actual tangential component is $c_{t2} = \\mu U_2$, so actual work is\\n$$w = U_2 c_{t2} = \\mu U_2^2$$\\nEquate to thermodynamic work: $\\mu U_2^2 = C_p\\Delta T_0$. Thus\\n$$U_2^2 = \\frac{C_p\\Delta T_0}{\\mu} = \\frac{2.33\\times10^5}{0.92} \\approx 2.53\\times10^5\\,(\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2)$$\\nSo $U_2 \\approx \\sqrt{2.53\\times10^5} \\approx 503\\,\\text{m/s}$.\\n\\n4) Convert tip speed to RPM:\\nTip speed $U_2$ is related to rotational speed $N$ and impeller diameter $D_2$ by\\n$$U_2 = \\pi D_2 \\frac{N}{60}$$\\nGiven $D_2 = 0.6\\,\\text{m}$,\\n$$N = \\frac{60U_2}{\\pi D_2} = \\frac{60\\times503}{\\pi\\times0.6} \\approx \\frac{30180}{1.884} \\approx 1.60\\times10^4\\,\\text{RPM}$$\\nThis lies within the official answer range 15948 to 16048 RPM, confirming the key."
