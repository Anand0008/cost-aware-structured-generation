        "notes": "RAG context provided highly relevant worked examples from V. Ganesan's Gas Turbines (Ch. 8) on centrifugal compressor calculations, including the key relationship $W_c = C_p \\Delta T_{0a} = \\mu U_2^2$ (with power input factor). The examples directly informed the solution approach. However, the provided chunks used isentropic efficiency, whereas this question uses polytropic efficiency. The underlying work equation is the same, so RAG was very helpful."

The air at the inlet of the rotor is at 1 atm and 25°C. The polytropic efficiency is 0.8 and slip factor is 0.92. Use C_p = 1.004 kJ/kg-K and γ = 1.4. The impeller speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) is _________. (round off to the nearest integer)"
