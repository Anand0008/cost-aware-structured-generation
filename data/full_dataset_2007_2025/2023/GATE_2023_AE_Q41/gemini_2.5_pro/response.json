For a calorically perfect gas, the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) is constant. Stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is related to stagnation temperature ($T_0$) by $h_0 = c_p T_0$.

The problem states that stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is constant between Station 1 (freestream, denoted by subscript $\\infty$) and Station 3 (combustor entry). It also specifies that air is a calorically perfect gas with a specific heat ratio $\\gamma$.",
          "Step 2: Relate stagnation enthalpy to stagnation temperature. For a calorically perfect gas, specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) is constant. The stagnation enthalpy is defined as $h_0 = c_p T_0$. Since $h_0$ is constant and $c_p$ is constant, it implies that the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) must also be constant between Station 1 and Station 3. Thus, $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the standard isentropic relation for stagnation temperature. The relationship between static temperature ($T$), stagnation temperature ($T_0$), and Mach number ($M$) for a calorically perfect gas is $T_0 = T \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \\right)$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the stagnation temperature relation at freestream (Station $\\infty$). Substitute the freestream conditions ($T_\\infty$, $M_\\infty$) into the stagnation temperature equation: $T_{0,\\infty} = T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right)$.",
          "Step 5: Apply the stagnation temperature relation at the combustor entry (Station 3). Substitute the conditions at Station 3 ($T_3$, $M_3$) into the stagnation temperature equation: $T_{0,3} = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$.",
          "Step 6: Equate the stagnation temperatures. Since $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$, set the expressions from Step 4 and Step 5 equal to each other: $T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$.",
          "Step 7: Rearrange the equation to solve for $M_3$. Isolate $M_3$ through algebraic manipulation: first divide by $T_3$, then subtract 1, and finally multiply by $\\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1}$ and take the square root.
