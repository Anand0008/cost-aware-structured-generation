In the given idealized wing model:\n\n1.  **Linear Spring (k):** The linear spring supports the wing vertically. This allows the wing to undergo translational motion in the vertical direction (often referred to as heave or plunge motion). This constitutes one independent degree of freedom.\n2.  **Torsional Spring (k_\\theta):** The torsional spring is shown allowing rotation about a point on the wing. For a wing section, this typically represents pitching motion (rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the diagram). This constitutes a second independent degree of freedom.\n\nSince these two motions (vertical translation and rotation) are independent of each other, the total number of degrees of freedom for this idealized wing vibration model is the sum of these independent motions, which is $1 + 1 = 2$."
