        "reasoning": "The idealized wing is a rigid body. It is attached to ground via a linear spring (allowing vertical translation) and a torsional spring (allowing rotation). In the plane of the diagram, a rigid body typically has three degrees of freedom (horizontal translation, vertical translation, rotation). However, the linear spring is oriented vertically and provides no restraint against horizontal translation. But in typical wing vibration models, especially for studying bending and torsion, the horizontal translation is either neglected or constrained by the support conditions implied by the springs. Here, the linear spring likely acts at a specific point (e.g., the elastic axis) and allows vertical motion, and the torsional spring allows rotation about that point or another. The two springs provide independent restoring forces for two independent motions: vertical displacement (plunge) and angular displacement (pitch). Thus, two independent coordinates are needed to describe the configuration, giving 2 degrees of freedom. This aligns with common lumped-parameter models for wing flutter analysis."

          "Step 1: Identify the system components. The wing is idealized as a rigid body of mass M. It is supported by a linear spring (stiffness k) and a torsional spring (stiffness k_θ). The center of gravity (CG) is marked.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of degrees of freedom (DOF). DOF is the number of independent coordinates required to completely specify the configuration of the system.",
          "Step 3: Analyze possible motions of the rigid body. In a 2D plane (as per the diagram), a rigid body has three possible motions: translation in x (horizontal), translation in y (vertical), and rotation (θ).",
          "Step 4: Consider constraints imposed by the supports. The linear spring resists vertical displacement but does not prevent horizontal translation. The torsional spring resists rotation. However, the springs are not rigid constraints; they allow motion but provide restoring forces.",
          "Step 5: Determine independent motions. Typically, for wing vibration studies, the model is designed to capture two primary modes: bending (vertical translation/plunge) and torsion (rotation/pitch). Horizontal translation is often not considered in such simplified models because it is not coupled strongly with aerodynamic forces or is constrained by other means (e.g., the attachment point of the torsional spring may prevent horizontal movement).",
          "Step 6: Conclude the number of DOF. Since the wing can move vertically (against the linear spring) and rotate (against the torsional spring) independently, two independent coordinates (e.g., vertical displacement at CG and angular displacement) are needed. Hence, DOF = 2."
