The lines of symmetry are both diagonals: PQ (top-left to bottom-right) and MN (top-right to bottom-left). To satisfy symmetry about both diagonals, each black square must have its mirror images across both diagonals included. The squares form two distinct orbits under the dihedral group of order 4 generated by reflections about the diagonals: Orbit A: {(1,2), (2,1), (4,3), (3,4)} contains two initial squares (1,2) and (2,1), requiring addition of (4,3) and (3,4). Orbit B: {(1,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,4)} contains one initial square (3,1), requiring addition of (1,3), (4,2), and (2,4). Thus, total additional squares = 2 + 3 = 5."

          "Step 1: Understand the grid and initial configuration. The figure is a 4x4 grid of 16 unit squares. Three squares are already black. Based on typical GATE 2023 and the description, assume they are at coordinates (row, column): (3,1), (1,2), and (2,1). Row 1 is top, column 1 is left.",
          "Step 2: Identify the lines of symmetry. PQ is the main diagonal from top-left (1,1) to bottom-right (4,4). MN is the other diagonal from top-right (1,4) to bottom-left (4,1).",
          "Step 3: Apply symmetry condition for diagonal PQ (main diagonal). Reflection across PQ maps (r,c) to (c,r). Thus, for each black square, its image must also be black. Check initial squares: (3,1) -> (1,3) must be black; (1,2) -> (2,1) is already black; (2,1) -> (1,2) is already black. So we need to add (1,3).",
          "Step 4: Apply symmetry condition for diagonal MN (anti-diagonal). Reflection across MN maps (r,c) to (5-c, 5-r). For each black square (including any added), its image must be black. Check initial and added: (3,1) -> (4,2) must be black; (1,2) -> (3,4) must be black; (2,1) -> (4,3) must be black; (1,3) -> (2,4) must be black. So we need to add (4,2), (3,4), (4,3), (2,4).",
          "Step 5: Ensure consistency and minimize additions. The process reveals that the required set of black squares is the union of two orbits under the symmetry group: Orbit A = {(1,2), (2,1), (4,3), (3,4)} and Orbit B = {(1,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,4)}. Initial set contains (1,2) and (2,1) from Orbit A, and (3,1) from Orbit B. To complete Orbit A, add (4,3) and (3,4). To complete Orbit B, add (1,3), (4,2), and (2,4). Total additional squares = 5.",
          "Step 6: Verify symmetry. After adding these 5 squares, the pattern is symmetric about both diagonals: each square's mirror images across both diagonals are present."
