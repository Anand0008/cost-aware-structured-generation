        "reasoning": "The problem requires identifying the minimum number of additional squares to be colored black to ensure symmetry about two given lines: PQ (vertical) and MN (diagonal). We start with the three initially black squares and iteratively apply the symmetry conditions for both lines.\n\nLet's denote squares by (row, column) where row 1 is the top row and column 1 is the leftmost column.\n\n**Initial black squares:**\n1.  (1,3) - Top row, 3rd column\n2.  (2,1) - 2nd row, 1st column\n3.  (4,3) - Bottom row, 3rd column\n\n**Line of Symmetry PQ:** This is a vertical line passing between column 2 and column 3. For a square at (r, c), its mirror image across PQ is at (r, 5-c).\n\n**Applying PQ symmetry to initial squares:**\n*   For (1,3): its mirror image is (1, 5-3) = (1,2). This square must be black. (New: 1)\n*   For (2,1): its mirror image is (2, 5-1) = (2,4). This square must be black. (New: 1)\n*   For (4,3): its mirror image is (4, 5-3) = (4,2). This square must be black. (New: 1)\n\n**Current set of black squares (after PQ symmetry):**\n{(1,3), (2,1), (4,3), (1,2), (2,4), (4,2)} (Total 6 squares)\n\n**Line of Symmetry MN:** This is a diagonal line passing from the bottom-left corner (4,1) to the top-right corner (1,4). The equation of this line is `r + c = 5`. For a square at (r, c), its mirror image across MN is at (5-c, 5-r).\n\n**Applying MN symmetry to the current set of 6 black squares:**\n*   For (1,3): its mirror image is (5-3, 5-1) = (2,4). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (2,1): its mirror image is (5-1, 5-2) = (4,3). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (4,3): its mirror image is (5-3, 5-4) = (2,1). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (1,2): its mirror image is (5-2, 5-1) = (3,4). This square must be black. (New: 1)\n*   For (2,4): its mirror image is (5-4, 5-2) = (1,3). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (4,2): its mirror image is (5-2, 5-4) = (3,1). This square must be black. (New: 1)\n\n**Current set of black squares (after MN symmetry):**\n{(1,3), (2,1), (4,3), (1,2), (2,4), (4,2), (3,4), (3,1)} (Total 8 squares)\n\n**Re-checking PQ symmetry for the newly added squares (3,4) and (3,1):**\n*   For (3,4): its mirror image across PQ is (3, 5-4) = (3,1). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (3,1): its mirror image across PQ is (3, 5-1) = (3,4). This square is already in the set.\n\nAll squares now satisfy both symmetry conditions. The final configuration has 8 black squares.\n\n**Minimum number of squares that must be coloured black (additional):**\nTotal black squares = 8\nInitial black squares = 3\nAdditional squares = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional squares to be colored black is 5."
