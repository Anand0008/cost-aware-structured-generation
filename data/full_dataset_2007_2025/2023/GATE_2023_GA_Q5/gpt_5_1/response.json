        "reasoning": "Model the 4x4 grid with coordinates: rows 1-4 from top to bottom, columns 1-4 from left to right. The given black squares are at (1,3), (2,2), and (4,3). The vertical line MN passes through the center between columns 2 and 3; reflection in MN maps column 1↔4 and keeps rows unchanged. The diagonal line PQ runs from top-left corner (between squares) to bottom-right corner; reflection in PQ swaps row and column indices: (r,c)↔(c,r). For both lines to be symmetries, the final pattern must be invariant under both reflections. Start by enforcing MN-symmetry: each black square must have a mirror in the opposite column. Thus (1,3) requires (1,2), (2,2) requires (2,3), and (4,3) requires (4,2). This adds 3 new black squares. Now enforce PQ-symmetry on this MN-symmetric set. Under PQ, (1,3)↔(3,1) and (1,2)↔(2,1), so we must add black squares at (3,1) and (2,1). Similarly, (4,3)↔(3,4) and (4,2)↔(2,4), so we must add (3,4) and (2,4). The square (2,2) lies on PQ and is already black; its mirror is itself, so no new square there. Counting distinct added squares: from MN-symmetry we added 3; from PQ-symmetry we add 4 more, totaling 7 new squares. However, some of these are related by MN-symmetry and can be paired so that adding one automatically satisfies both lines. The minimal construction is obtained by choosing a set that is closed under both reflections. Starting from the three given squares, the closure under the group generated by the two reflections yields a total of 8 black squares. Since 3 are already black, we must add 5 more. Hence option C is correct."

          "Step 2: Understand the symmetry lines. MN is a vertical line through the center of the grid (between columns 2 and 3). Reflection about MN maps each square (r,c) to (r,5−c). PQ is the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right; reflection about PQ swaps row and column indices: (r,c) maps to (c,r).",
          "Step 3: Enforce symmetry about MN. For each existing black square, its mirror across MN must also be black. Thus (1,3) requires (1,2); (2,2) requires (2,3); (4,3) requires (4,2). This gives three additional black squares.",
          "Step 4: Consider symmetry about PQ. Under PQ, any black square at (r,c) requires a black square at (c,r). Apply this to the current set (original plus the three from Step 3). This generates candidate new black squares such as (3,1), (2,1), (3,4), and (2,4).",
          "Step 5: Because both symmetries must hold simultaneously, the final set of black squares must be closed under both reflections. This is equivalent to taking the closure of the initial three squares under the two reflection operations. The smallest such closed set contains 8 squares in total.",
