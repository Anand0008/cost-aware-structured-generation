The question states that there are already 3 black squares, and the goal is to find the minimum number of additional squares that must be colored black such that both PQ and MN form lines of symmetry.\n\nTo achieve symmetry along the diagonal line PQ, the figure must be symmetric about this line. This means that for every black square above the PQ line, there must be a corresponding black square below the PQ line. Similarly, for symmetry along the horizontal line MN, the figure must be symmetric about this line, requiring that for every black square to the left of the MN line, there must be a corresponding black square to the right of the MN line.\n\nGiven the 3 existing black squares, the minimum number of additional squares that must be colored black to achieve the required symmetry is 2. This will result in a total of 5 black squares, which is the correct answer (Option C)."
