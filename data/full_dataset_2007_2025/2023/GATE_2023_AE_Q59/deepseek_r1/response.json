However, the question is about thrust required in a steady climb, which involves an additional $W\\sin\\theta$ term. RAG did not contain explicit climb equations, but the level flight thrust required methodology (compute drag, use L/D) is a foundation. I relied on internal knowledge for climb force balance. Chunk 6 provided a power required example but not directly applicable."
