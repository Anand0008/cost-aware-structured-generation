        "reasoning": "The problem defines the overall efficiency ($\\eta_o$) as the ratio of propulsive power to the total heat release in the combustor. \\n1. Propulsive power is given by $F V_0$, where $F$ is the thrust and $V_0$ is the vehicle velocity.\\n2. Total heat release rate in the combustor is given by $\\dot{m}_f H_c$, where $\\dot{m}_f$ is the fuel mass flow rate and $H_c$ is the heat of combustion.\\nTherefore, the overall efficiency can be written as: $$\\eta_o = \\frac{F V_0}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$$ \\n3. The specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is defined as the thrust per unit weight flow rate of fuel: $$I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m}_f g_0}$$ where $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\\n4. From the specific impulse definition, we can express thrust as $F = I_{sp} \\dot{m}_f g_0$.\\n5. Substitute this expression for $F$ into the overall efficiency equation:\\n$$\\eta_o = \\frac{(I_{sp} \\dot{m}_f g_0) V_0}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$$ \\n6. The fuel mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\\n$$\\eta_o = \\frac{I_{sp} g_0 V_0}{H_c}$$ \\n7. Rearrange the equation to solve for specific impulse ($I_{sp}$):\\n$$I_{sp} = \\frac{\\eta_o H_c}{g_0 V_0}$$ \\n8. Plug in the given values:\\n$V_0 = 1000$ m/s\\n$H_c = 120$ MJ/kg $= 120 \\times 10^6$ J/kg\\n$\\eta_o = 40\\% = 0.40$\\n$g_0 = 10$ m/s$^2$\\n$$I_{sp} = \\frac{0.40 \\times (120 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg})}{10 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\times 1000 \\text{ m/s}} = \\frac{0.40 \\times 120 \\times 10^6}{10^4} = 0.40 \\times 120 \\times 10^2 = 4800 \\text{ seconds}$$ \\nThe calculated value of 4800 seconds falls within the acceptable range of 4800 to 4900 specified in the answer key."

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent definitions for specific impulse, propulsive efficiency, internal efficiency, and overall efficiency, which were crucial for understanding the underlying principles. CHUNK 2 (Sutton-Biblarz) and CHUNK 5 (Worked Example) were particularly helpful in providing the necessary formulas and demonstrating their application. CHUNK 1 (Dr. D.P. Mishra) provided conceptual context for ramjet efficiencies. While the exact combined formula was derived from the question's specific definition of overall efficiency, the RAG context provided all the necessary building blocks and definitions for a robust solution."

    "question_text": "A supersonic vehicle powered by a ramjet engine is cruising at a speed of 1000 m/s. The ramjet engine burns hydrogen in a subsonic combustor to produce thrust. The heat of combustion for hydrogen is 120 MJ/kg. The overall efficiency of the engine ηₒ, defined as the ratio of propulsive power to the total heat release in the combustor, is 40%. Taking acceleration due to gravity g₀ = 10 m/s², the specific impulse of the engine is _____________ seconds. (round off to the nearest integer)."
