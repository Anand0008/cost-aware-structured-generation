The heat of combustion for hydrogen is 120 MJ/kg. The overall efficiency of the engine ηₒ, defined as the ratio of propulsive power to the total heat release in the combustor, is 40%. Taking acceleration due to gravity g₀ = 10 m/s², the specific impulse of the engine is _____________ seconds. (round off to the nearest integer)."
