This can be determined using the concept of logarithmic decrement, which relates the damping ratio to the decay of amplitude over successive cycles.

Then, the relationship between the initial amplitude ($X_0$) and the amplitude after 'n' cycles ($X_n$) is used to find the final amplitude. The calculated value of approximately 2.83 cm falls within the specified correct answer range."
