For initial displacement $x_0$ and zero initial velocity, the amplitude envelope is $x_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t}$. After exactly two damped periods ($t = 2T_d$), the amplitude is $x_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n (2T_d)}$. Using the relation $T_d = 2\\pi / \\omega_d$ and $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, the exponent simplifies to $-4\\pi \\zeta / \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, which is also equal to $-2\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the logarithmic decrement.

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the key principle - The amplitude of a viscously damped free vibration decays exponentially. The displacement of an underdamped SDOF system with initial displacement $x_0$ and zero initial velocity is given by $x(t) = x_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t} \\left( \\cos(\\omega_d t) + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right)$. The amplitude (envelope) at any time is $A(t) = x_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t}$.",
          "Step 2: Define given parameters - Damping ratio $\\zeta = 0.1$, initial amplitude $A_0 = 10$ cm, number of complete cycles $n = 2$.",
          "Step 3: Relate time to damped period - The time for $n$ complete cycles is $t = n T_d$, where $T_d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_d}$ is the damped period. For $n=2$, $t = 2T_d$.",
          "Step 4: Express $\\omega_n t$ in terms of $\\zeta$ and $n$ - Since $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, we have $T_d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$. Therefore, $t = 2T_d = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$. Multiplying by $\\omega_n$ gives $\\omega_n t = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$.",
          "Step 5: Write the amplitude after two cycles - $A(2T_d) = A_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t} = A_0 e^{-\\zeta \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}} = A_0 e^{\\frac{-4\\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}}$.",
          "Step 6: Connect to logarithmic decrement - The logarithmic decrement $\\delta = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A(t+T_d)}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$. After $n$ cycles, the amplitude ratio is $A_0 / A_n = e^{n\\delta}$. Thus, $A_n = A_0 e^{-n\\delta} = A_0 e^{-\\frac{2\\pi n \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}}$. For $n=2$, this matches the expression from Step 5.",
          "Step 7: Perform numerical calculation - Plug $\\zeta=0.1$, $A_0=10$ cm into $A = 10 \\times e^{\\frac{-4\\pi (0.1)}{\\sqrt{1-0.1^2}}}$.",
          "Step 8: Compute stepwise - $\\sqrt{1-0.01} = \\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 0.994987$. Exponent: $\\frac{-4\\pi \\times 0.1}{0.994987} \\approx \\frac{-1.256637}{0.994987} \\approx -1.2627$.
