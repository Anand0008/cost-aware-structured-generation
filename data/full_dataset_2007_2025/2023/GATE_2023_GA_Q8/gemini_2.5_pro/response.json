We must strictly adhere to the information provided in the text.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that it does not have enough foreign exchange.**\n    *   The passage states: 'The latter [referring to 'the root causes of its crisis'] has starved it of foreign exchange and led to shortages...'. This indicates that the foreign exchange shortage is a *consequence* or *effect* of the root causes, not the root cause itself. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n*   **B. The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.**\n    *   The passage states: 'In a statement, the World Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms that focus on economic stabilisation and tackle the root causes of its crisis.' While the World Bank identifies what Sri Lanka needs to do, it does not state that it *will advise* the government on *how* to tackle these causes. It only states the necessity for Sri Lanka to act. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n*   **C. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.**\n    *   The passage explicitly states: 'The World Bank has declared that it does not plan to offer new financing to Sri Lanka... until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place.' The phrase 'until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place' directly implies that, at the current time, such a framework is *not* in place. This statement can be inferred with certainty.\n*   **D. The World Bank has stated that it will provide Sri Lanka with additional funds for essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines.**\n    *   The passage states: 'The bank is repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages of essential items...'. 'Repurposing resources under existing loans' means reallocating funds from already approved loans, not providing *additional* new funds. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option C can be inferred with certainty from the given passage."

          "Step 3: Analyze Option A: 'According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that it does not have enough foreign exchange.' Locate relevant text: 'The latter [root causes] has starved it of foreign exchange'. Conclude that foreign exchange shortage is an *effect* of root causes, not the cause itself. Eliminate A.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option B: 'The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.' Locate relevant text: 'The World Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms... and tackle the root causes'. Note that the passage states what Sri Lanka *needs* to do, not that the World Bank *will advise* on *how*. Eliminate B.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option C: 'According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.' Locate relevant text: 'The World Bank has declared that it does not plan to offer new financing to Sri Lanka... until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place.' Infer that 'until' implies the framework is currently *not* in place. Confirm C as a certain inference.",
          "Step 6: Analyze Option D: 'The World Bank has stated that it will provide Sri Lanka with additional funds for essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines.' Locate relevant text: 'The bank is repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages...'. Understand that 'repurposing existing loans' is different from 'providing additional funds'. Eliminate D.",
