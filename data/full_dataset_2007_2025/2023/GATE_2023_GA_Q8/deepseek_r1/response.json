The word 'until' implies a condition that is currently not met. Therefore, it can be inferred with certainty that, according to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have such a framework. Option A is incorrect because while the passage mentions foreign exchange shortage as a consequence, it does not explicitly state it as the root cause.

          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: The passage says the World Bank will not offer new financing 'until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place.' The use of 'until' strongly implies the framework is currently not adequate. This can be inferred with certainty.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: The passage says the bank is 'repurposing resources under existing loans' to help with shortages. This is not 'additional funds'; it is reallocation of existing commitments. Thus, this statement is false."
