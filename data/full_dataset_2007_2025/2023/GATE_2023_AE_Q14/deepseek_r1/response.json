        "reasoning": "The Kutta condition requires smooth flow at the trailing edge, achieved by adding an appropriate circulation. For a typical airfoil at a positive angle of attack (implied by common streamline patterns), the rear stagnation point must be moved to the trailing edge. This is accomplished by adding clockwise circulation (Γ < 0, as per the right-hand rule convention), which increases upper surface velocity and decreases lower surface velocity, equalizing them at the trailing edge. Sources (A, B) add/remove mass but do not affect circulation or stagnation point location for lift generation."

          "Step 1: Understand the Kutta condition - For steady, inviscid, incompressible flow past an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge, the flow must leave the trailing edge smoothly. This implies equal velocities (and thus equal pressures) on the upper and lower surfaces at the trailing edge.",
          "Step 2: Recognize the role of circulation - In potential flow theory, the solution is non-unique without the Kutta condition. Adding circulation adjusts the stagnation point locations. To satisfy the Kutta condition, a specific amount of circulation must be added such that the rear stagnation point coincides with the trailing edge.",
          "Step 3: Determine the direction of required circulation - For an airfoil generating positive lift (typical at positive angle of attack), the upper surface velocity must be higher than the lower surface velocity. Clockwise circulation (negative Γ, as defined in the question) adds velocity in the direction of the freestream on the upper surface and opposes it on the lower surface, creating this asymmetry.",
          "Step 4: Eliminate incorrect options - Adding a source (Q > 0 or Q < 0) introduces a radial flow, altering mass flow but not directly affecting the global circulation or moving stagnation points to satisfy the Kutta condition for lift generation. Thus, options A and B are incorrect.",
          "Step 5: Select the correct sign - Option C (Γ > 0, counter-clockwise) would increase lower surface velocity and decrease upper surface velocity, moving the rear stagnation point upwards away from the trailing edge for a positively cambered airfoil or positive angle of attack, violating the Kutta condition. Option D (Γ < 0, clockwise) provides the correct direction to bring the stagnation point to the trailing edge."
