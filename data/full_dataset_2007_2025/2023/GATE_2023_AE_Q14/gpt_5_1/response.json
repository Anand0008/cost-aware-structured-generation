        "reasoning": "In potential flow around an airfoil, circulation \\(\\Gamma\\) is what produces lift (Kutta–Joukowski theorem). The Kutta condition requires that the flow leave the sharp trailing edge smoothly, which uniquely fixes the value and sign of \\(\\Gamma\\). For a typical airfoil at positive geometric angle of attack (freestream from left to right, airfoil nose up), the physical lift is upward. Using the standard sign convention (counter-clockwise circulation positive), an upward lift on a body in a left-to-right freestream corresponds to *clockwise* circulation, i.e. \\(\\Gamma < 0\\). Therefore, to enforce the Kutta condition on a symmetric potential-flow pattern that currently has no net circulation (or the wrong sign), we must add a vortex of strength \\(\\Gamma < 0\\), i.e. clockwise circulation. Adding a source (options A or B) would change the mass flux but not create the required circulation; adding counter-clockwise circulation (option C) would give lift in the opposite direction to that implied by the usual airfoil orientation. Hence option D is the correct additional condition."
