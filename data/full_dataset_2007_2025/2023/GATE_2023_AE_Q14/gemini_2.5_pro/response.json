        "reasoning": "The Kutta condition is a physical principle applied in potential flow theory to ensure that the flow leaves the sharp trailing edge of an airfoil smoothly, preventing infinite velocities or pressure discontinuities. This condition is crucial for obtaining a unique and physically realistic value for the circulation around the airfoil, which in turn determines the lift (as per the Kutta-Joukowski theorem).\n\n1.  **Eliminate Sources (A & B):** Sources (or sinks) add or remove fluid from the flow field. They are used to model phenomena like jet engines or porous bodies, but they do not directly contribute to satisfying the Kutta condition at a sharp trailing edge by smoothing the flow. The Kutta condition is fundamentally about adjusting the circulation.\n2.  **Role of Circulation (C & D):** The Kutta condition is satisfied by adding a specific amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) to the potential flow solution. This circulation effectively shifts the stagnation points such that one stagnation point is precisely located at the trailing edge, forcing the flow to leave smoothly (as detailed in RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5).\n3.  **Direction of Circulation:** The question refers to a 'streamline pattern as shown in the figure'. Since the figure is not provided, we must infer the nature of the initial unphysical flow. For a typical airfoil at a positive angle of attack, without the Kutta condition, the potential flow would tend to wrap around the trailing edge from the lower surface to the upper surface, creating an unphysical 'upward jet' effect. To smooth this out and bring the stagnation point to the trailing edge, a counter-clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma > 0$) is added, which generates positive lift. However, if the initial streamline pattern (as implied by the correct answer D) shows the flow wrapping around the trailing edge from the upper surface to the lower surface (an 'downward jet' effect), then adding a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) would be required to smooth the flow and bring the stagnation point to the trailing edge. This would result in negative lift.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Given that the correct answer is D, it implies that the initial potential flow solution shown in the (missing) figure is one that requires the addition of a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) to satisfy the Kutta condition and achieve a smooth flow departure at the trailing edge. The fundamental mechanism is the addition of circulation, and the sign depends on the specific unphysical flow pattern that needs to be corrected."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the Kutta condition. The Kutta condition is a physical constraint stating that for a lifting airfoil with a sharp trailing edge, the flow must leave the trailing edge smoothly. This prevents infinite velocities or pressure discontinuities predicted by simple potential flow theory (RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5).",
          "Step 2: Identify the purpose of the Kutta condition. It ensures a unique and physically realistic value for the circulation around the airfoil, which is essential for calculating a definitive lift force using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem (RAG Chunks 4, 5).",
          "Step 3: Evaluate the role of sources/sinks. Sources (positive strength, Q > 0) and sinks (negative strength, Q < 0) represent the addition or removal of fluid. They are not the mechanism used to smooth the flow at a sharp trailing edge or to determine circulation in the context of the Kutta condition. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the role of circulation. In potential flow theory, the Kutta condition is satisfied by superimposing a specific amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) onto the non-circulatory flow. This circulation adjusts the flow field such that the stagnation point is forced to the trailing edge, ensuring a smooth departure of streamlines (RAG Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5).",
          "Step 5: Determine the direction of circulation. The direction (sign) of the required circulation depends on the initial, unphysical streamline pattern at the trailing edge. If the initial flow shows streamlines wrapping from the upper surface to the lower surface at the trailing edge (an 'unphysical downward jet'), then adding a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) would be necessary to smooth the flow. Conversely, if the flow wraps from lower to upper (an 'unphysical upward jet', typical for positive angle of attack), counter-clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma > 0$) would be needed. Since the provided answer is D, it implies the initial streamline pattern in the (missing) figure is one that requires clockwise circulation to satisfy the Kutta condition.",
          "Step 6: Conclude based on the options. The Kutta condition is satisfied by adding circulation. Given the options and the correct answer, the addition of a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) is the required condition."
