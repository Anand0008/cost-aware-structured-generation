This implies that the circulation around the airfoil must be such that the velocities on the upper and lower surfaces at the trailing edge are equal in magnitude and direction. \n\nThe streamline pattern shown in the figure indicates that the flow is accelerating on the upper surface and decelerating on the lower surface. This asymmetry in the flow field can only be achieved by the addition of a counter-clockwise circulation (Γ < 0) around the airfoil. A clockwise circulation (Γ > 0) would result in the opposite flow pattern, which would violate the Kutta condition. Therefore, the correct additional condition to satisfy the Kutta condition for the given streamline pattern is the addition of a circulation of strength Γ < 0 (clockwise)."
