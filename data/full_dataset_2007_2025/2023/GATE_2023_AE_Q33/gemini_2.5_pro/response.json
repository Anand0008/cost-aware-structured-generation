The temperature ($T = 300$ K) and the universal gas constant ($R_u$) are the same for both gases.\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio of the speed of sound in H₂ to N₂ can be simplified as:\\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{H_2} R_u T}{M_{H_2}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{N_2} R_u T}{M_{N_2}}}} $$\\nSince $\\gamma_{H_2} = \\gamma_{N_2}$, $R_u$ is constant, and $T$ is constant:\\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{N_2}}{M_{H_2}}} $$\\nGiven $M_{H_2} = 2$ kg/kmol and $M_{N_2} = 28$ kg/kmol:\\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{28}{2}} = \\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.741657 $$\\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 3.74.
