          "Step 3: Heat addition is an irreversible process (due to finite temperature difference), leading to an increase in entropy and a decrease in stagnation pressure ($p_0^2 < p_0^1$) regardless of area change. Thus, statement B is true.",
          "Step 4: For Mach number: In supersonic flow, heat addition alone (e.g., in constant-area Rayleigh flow) decreases Mach number toward 1. However, in a diverging duct, area increase alone (without heat) increases Mach number for supersonic flow. The combined effect depends on the amount of heat added relative to area change; thus, $M_2 > M_1$ is not guaranteed always. Statement A is not always true.",
          "Step 5: For static pressure: In supersonic flow, heat addition alone increases static pressure, while area increase alone decreases static pressure. Again, the net effect is not predetermined; $P_2 > P_1$ is not always true. Statement C is not always true.",
