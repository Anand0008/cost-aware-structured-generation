Thus M_2 < M_1, so statement A (M_2 > M_1) is false.\n4) Static pressure behavior in Rayleigh flow is not monotonic with heat addition; for supersonic flow, adding heat initially increases p, but near choking trends can change, and the presence of a diverging geometry further complicates p_2 vs p_1. Therefore P_2 > P_1 is not guaranteed in all cases, so C is not \\\"always\\\" true.\nHence only B and D are always valid."
