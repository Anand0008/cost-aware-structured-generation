        "reasoning": "The question describes a one-dimensional, inviscid, supersonic flow in a diverging duct with heat addition ($Q_{in}$). We need to evaluate each statement based on the principles of gas dynamics, specifically considering the effects of heat addition and area change.\n\n1.  **Analyze Option A: Mach number, $M_2 > M_1$**\n    *   For supersonic flow in a diverging duct *without heat addition* (isentropic flow), the Mach number increases ($M_2 > M_1$).\n    *   For supersonic flow *with heat addition* in a constant area duct (Rayleigh flow), the Mach number decreases, approaching $M=1$ (thermal choking). This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunk 3: 'Adding heat drives both subsonic and supersonic flows toward M=1.'\n    *   In this problem, we have both a diverging duct (tends to increase M) and heat addition (tends to decrease M for supersonic flow). These two effects oppose each other. Therefore, the net change in Mach number is not always an increase. It depends on the relative magnitudes of the area change effect and the heat addition effect. Hence, statement A is NOT always TRUE.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option B: Stagnation pressure, $P_1^o > P_2^o$**\n    *   Heat addition is an irreversible process, even in an inviscid flow, because it involves heat transfer across a finite temperature difference. \n    *   A fundamental principle of gas dynamics is that any irreversible process (like heat addition, friction, or shock waves) always leads to a decrease in stagnation pressure ($p_0$). This is clearly stated in RAG Chunk 1: 'Heat addition is an irreversible process, which always results in a loss of stagnation pressure.' and RAG Chunk 3: 'Stagnation Pressure Loss: Heat addition is an irreversible process that always causes a drop in stagnation pressure ($p_0$).'\n    *   Therefore, $P_1^o > P_2^o$ is ALWAYS TRUE.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option C: Static pressure, $P_2 > P_1$**\n    *   For supersonic flow in a diverging duct *without heat addition*, static pressure decreases ($P_2 < P_1$).\n    *   For supersonic flow *with heat addition* in a constant area duct (Rayleigh flow), as the Mach number decreases towards $M=1$, the static pressure increases ($P_2 > P_1$). This can be seen from the Rayleigh flow static pressure ratio formula in RAG Chunk 1: $\\frac{{p_2}}{{p_1}} = \\frac{{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}}{{1 + \\gamma M_2^2}}$. If $M_1 > M_2$ (due to heat addition in supersonic flow), then $p_2 > p_1$.\n    *   Similar to Mach number, the effects of area change and heat addition on static pressure are contradictory for supersonic flow in a diverging duct. The net effect is not always an increase. Hence, statement C is NOT always TRUE.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option D: Stagnation temperature, $T_1^o < T_2^o$**\n    *   Heat addition ($Q_{in}$) directly increases the total energy of the flow. The stagnation temperature ($T_0$) is a direct measure of the total enthalpy (or total energy per unit mass) of the flow.\n    *   From the energy equation for a control volume with heat addition: $Q_{in} = \\dot{m} c_p (T_{02} - T_{01})$. Since $Q_{in}$ is added to the system ($Q_{in} > 0$), the stagnation temperature must increase. \n    *   Therefore, $T_{02} > T_{01}$ (or $T_1^o < T_2^o$) is ALWAYS TRUE. This is also mentioned in RAG Chunk 1: 'The ratio of stagnation temperatures is the primary driver of all other property changes in Rayleigh flow. It is directly related to the amount of heat added or removed between states 1 and 2.'\n\nBased on this analysis, statements B and D are always TRUE."

Thus, option A is not always true.",

The RAG context directly supported the analysis for options B and D, and the reasoning for A and C being not always true."
