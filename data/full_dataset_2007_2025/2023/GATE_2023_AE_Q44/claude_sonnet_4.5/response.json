Heat addition can cause the Mach number to either increase or decrease, depending on the initial Mach number. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nB. Stagnation pressure, P_1^o > P_2^o: This statement is always true. Heat addition is an irreversible process, which causes a loss of stagnation pressure. Therefore, the stagnation pressure downstream (P_2^o) will be lower than the upstream stagnation pressure (P_1^o).\n\nC. Static pressure, P_2 > P_1: This statement is not always true. The static pressure can either increase or decrease depending on the initial Mach number and the amount of heat added. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nD. Stagnation temperature, T_1^o < T_2^o: This statement is always true. Heat addition increases the stagnation temperature, so the downstream stagnation temperature (T_2^o) will be higher than the upstream stagnation temperature (T_1^o).\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B and D."
