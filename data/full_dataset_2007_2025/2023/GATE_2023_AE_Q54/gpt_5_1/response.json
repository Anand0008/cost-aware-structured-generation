        "reasoning": "The ODE is an Euler-Cauchy (equidimensional) equation: x^2 y'' + 4x y' + 2y = 0. Assume a trial solution y = x^m. Then y' = m x^{m-1}, y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}. Substituting gives x^2 m(m-1)x^{m-2} + 4x m x^{m-1} + 2 x^m = 0, i.e. [m(m-1) + 4m + 2] x^m = 0. The indicial equation is m^2 + 3m + 2 = 0, whose roots are m = -1 and m = -2. Thus the general solution is y(x) = C_1 x^{-1} + C_2 x^{-2}. Apply initial conditions at x=1: y(1)=0 gives C_1 + C_2 = 0 → C_2 = -C_1. Next y'(x) = -C_1 x^{-2} - 2C_2 x^{-3}. At x=1, y'(1) = -C_1 - 2C_2 = 1. Using C_2 = -C_1, we get -C_1 - 2(-C_1) = -C_1 + 2C_1 = C_1 = 1, so C_1 = 1, C_2 = -1. Therefore y(x) = x^{-1} - x^{-2} = 1/x - 1/x^2. At x=2, y(2) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 = 0.25, which lies in the official answer range 0.24–0.26."
