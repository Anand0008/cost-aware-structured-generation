        "reasoning": "The given differential equation, $x^2 \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4x \\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0$, is a second-order homogeneous Cauchy-Euler equation. The standard approach is to assume a solution of the form $y = x^m$. Substituting $y = x^m$, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = m x^{m-1}$, and $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = m(m-1) x^{m-2}$ into the ODE yields the characteristic equation: $m(m-1) + 4m + 2 = 0$. This simplifies to $m^2 + 3m + 2 = 0$, which factors as $(m+1)(m+2) = 0$. The roots are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -2$. Therefore, the general solution is $y(x) = C_1 x^{-1} + C_2 x^{-2} = \\frac{C_1}{x} + \\frac{C_2}{x^2}$.\\nNext, we apply the initial conditions. First, $y(1) = 0$: $0 = \\frac{C_1}{1} + \\frac{C_2}{1^2} \\implies C_1 + C_2 = 0$ (Equation 1). \\nThen, we find the first derivative: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -C_1 x^{-2} - 2C_2 x^{-3} = -\\frac{C_1}{x^2} - \\frac{2C_2}{x^3}$. Applying the second initial condition, $\\frac{dy}{dx}(1) = 1$: $1 = -\\frac{C_1}{1^2} - \\frac{2C_2}{1^3} \\implies -C_1 - 2C_2 = 1$ (Equation 2).\\nSolving the system of equations (1) and (2): From (1), $C_1 = -C_2$. Substituting into (2): $-(-C_2) - 2C_2 = 1 \\implies C_2 - 2C_2 = 1 \\implies -C_2 = 1 \\implies C_2 = -1$. Then, $C_1 = -(-1) = 1$. \\nThe particular solution is $y(x) = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\\nFinally, we evaluate $y$ at $x = 2$: $y(2) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$. Rounding to two decimal places, the value is $0.25$. This falls within the accepted range of 0.24 to 0.26."

However, the RAG context did not provide specific guidance or formulas for solving Cauchy-Euler equations, which was the primary method required for this problem. Therefore, I relied on internal knowledge for the core solution technique of the Cauchy-Euler equation."
