We are given the lengths of PS, PT, and PV. Using these values, we can calculate the length of RS as follows:\n\n1. In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the four sides.\n2. Let the length of RS be x.\n3. Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle PQR, we have:\n   $x^2 = 7^2 + 4^2 = 49 + 16 = 65$\n4. Taking the square root, we get $x = \\sqrt{65} = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{28}{5}$.\n\nThus, the length of RS is \\frac{28}{5} cm."
