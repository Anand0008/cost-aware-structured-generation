          "Step 1: Understand the geometry. PQRS is a rectangle (right angles at Q and R). PS = 7 cm (horizontal). Let PQ = RS = b cm (vertical). Place P at origin (0,0), S at (7,0), Q at (0,b), R at (7,b).",
          "Step 2: Locate points T and V. Given PT = 4 cm, and T lies on PQ (vertical side). So, T = (0,4). Given PV = 5 cm, and V lies on PS (horizontal side). So, V = (5,0).",
          "Step 3: Write equations of lines TS and VQ. Line TS: from T(0,4) to S(7,0). Slope = (0-4)/(7-0) = -4/7. Equation: y = 4 - (4/7)x. Line VQ: from V(5,0) to Q(0,b). Slope = (b-0)/(0-5) = -b/5. Equation: y = -(b/5)(x-5).",
          "Step 4: Assume intersection point of TS and VQ lies on diagonal PR. Diagonal PR: from P(0,0) to R(7,b). Equation: y = (b/7)x.",
          "Step 5: Find intersection of TS and PR. Set y from TS equal to y from PR: 4 - (4/7)x = (b/7)x. Multiply by 7: 28 - 4x = b x => 28 = (b+4)x => x = 28/(b+4).",
          "Step 6: Also, intersection of TS and VQ must satisfy both line equations. Equate y from TS and VQ: 4 - (4/7)x = -(b/5)(x-5). Multiply by 35: 140 - 20x = -7b(x-5) => 140 - 20x = -7b x + 35b => (7b - 20)x = 35b - 140 => x = (35b - 140)/(7b - 20) = (35(b-4))/(7b-20).",
          "Step 7: Since this intersection also lies on PR, the x-coordinate must match Step 5. Set 28/(b+4) = (35(b-4))/(7b-20). Cross-multiply: 28(7b-20) = 35(b-4)(b+4). Simplify: 196b - 560 = 35(b^2 - 16) = 35b^2 - 560. Cancel -560: 196b = 35b^2 => 35b^2 - 196b = 0 => b(35b - 196)=0. Non-zero solution: b = 196/35 = 28/5.",
