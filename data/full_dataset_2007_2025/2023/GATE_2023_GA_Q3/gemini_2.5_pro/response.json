Base RS (unknown), with corresponding height PV = 5 cm.\n\nSince the area of the parallelogram is unique, we can equate the two expressions for its area:\nArea = Base$_1$ \\times Height$_1$ = Base$_2$ \\times Height$_2$\nPS \\times PT = RS \\times PV\n7 cm \\times 4 cm = RS \\times 5 cm\n28 cm$^2$ = RS \\times 5 cm\nRS = $\\frac{28}{5}$ cm\n\nThis matches option B."
