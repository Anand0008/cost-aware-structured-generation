According to the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1 and Chunk 6), the 'Negative Low Angle of Attack (AoA)' condition is precisely characterized by 'critical compressive stresses in the lower-aft region of the wing cross-section and maximum tensile stresses in the upper-forward region'. This description perfectly matches the observations provided in the question. Other options describe different stress distributions: Positive High AoA has compression in upper-forward and tension in lower-aft (Chunk 5); Negative High AoA has tension in lower-forward and compression in upper-aft (Chunk 2, 3); Positive Low AoA has tension in upper-rear and compression in lower-front (Chunk 4)."

          "Step 4: Compare these observations with the known stress distributions for each of the four critical loading conditions, drawing upon knowledge of aircraft structures and aerodynamics.",
          "Step 5: From the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1 and Chunk 6), it is stated that for a 'Negative Low Angle of Attack (AoA)', critical compressive stresses occur in the lower-aft region and maximum tensile stresses occur in the upper-forward region. This directly matches the conditions described in the question.",
          "Step 6: Confirm that other options do not match: Positive High AoA (Chunk 5) has compression in upper-forward and tension in lower-aft. Negative High AoA (Chunk 2, 3) has tension in lower-forward and compression in upper-aft. Positive Low AoA (Chunk 4) has tensile in upper-rear and compressive in lower-front. Therefore, 'Negative Low Angle of Attack' is the correct answer."
