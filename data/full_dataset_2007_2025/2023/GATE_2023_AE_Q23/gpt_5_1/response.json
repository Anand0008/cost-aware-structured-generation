Positive high AoA (large positive lift, wing bends up): compression in upper-forward region, tension in lower-aft region.\n2. Positive low AoA: tension in upper-rear, compression in lower-front (more influenced by torsion/pressure distribution).\n3. Negative high AoA (large negative lift, wing bends down strongly): tension in lower-forward, compression in upper-aft.\n4. Negative low AoA: compression in lower-aft, tension in upper-forward.\n\nThe question states that (i) compressive bending stress is maximum at the bottom aft region, and (ii) tensile bending stress is maximum at the upper forward region. This pattern (compression lower-aft, tension upper-forward) matches exactly the description of the **negative low angle of attack** case in the RAG chunks (Chunks 1 and 6). Therefore, the correct loading condition is option D: Negative low angle of attack."

    "question_text": "Consider the four basic symmetrical flight loading conditions corresponding to the corners of a typical V-n diagram. For one of these flight loading conditions, it is observed that (i) the compressive bending stresses have a maximum value in the bottom aft region (see figure) of the wing cross-section; and (ii) the tensile bending stresses are maximum in the upper forward region (see figure) of the wing cross-section. For the preceding observations, select the corresponding flight loading condition from the options given."
