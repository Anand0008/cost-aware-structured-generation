These stress distributions are characteristic of a Negative Low Angle of Attack (AoA) condition, where the wing experiences a small downward aerodynamic force. This causes compressive stresses in the lower-aft region and tensile stresses in the upper-forward region, as described in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, Negative Low Angle of Attack."
