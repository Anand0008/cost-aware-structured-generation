        "reasoning": "The question describes a perfect gas exhausting through a convergent duct at choked conditions. This means the Mach number at the nozzle exit (throat) is M=1. We need to analyze how increasing the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) affects the exit velocity (u), Mach number (M), pressure (p), temperature (T), and density ($\\rho$), assuming the reservoir temperature ($T_0$) remains constant.\n\n1.  **Mach number (M):** Since the nozzle is already operating at choked conditions, the flow at the exit is sonic (M=1). Increasing the reservoir pressure further will not change the Mach number at the exit, as it's already at its maximum possible value. Thus, **M remains the same**.\n\n2.  **Temperature (T):** For isentropic flow at the choked exit (M=1), the static temperature ($T$) is related to the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) by the isentropic relation: $T = T_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)$. Since the reservoir temperature ($T_0$) is stated as constant and $\\gamma$ (specific heat ratio) is constant for a perfect gas, the static temperature $T$ at the exit **remains the same**.\n\n3.  **Velocity (u):** The velocity at the choked exit is the speed of sound, $u = a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$. Since $\\gamma$, $R$ (gas constant), and $T$ (static temperature at exit) all remain the same, the exit velocity $u$ also **remains the same**.\n\n4.  **Pressure (p):** For isentropic flow at the choked exit (M=1), the static pressure ($p$) is related to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) by the isentropic relation: $p = P_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$. Since the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) is increased and the term $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$ is a constant, the static pressure $p$ at the exit **increases**.\n\n5.  **Density ($\\rho$):** Using the ideal gas law, $p = \\rho R T$, we can write $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$. Since $p$ increases and $T$ remains the same (and $R$ is constant), the density $\\rho$ at the exit **increases**.\n\nTherefore, u, M, and T remain the same, while p and $\\rho$ increase. This matches option C."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the initial conditions. The gas is in a large reservoir (stagnation conditions $P_0, T_0$) and exhausts through a convergent duct into the atmosphere. Crucially, the flow is at 'choked conditions', meaning the Mach number at the exit (which is the throat for a convergent nozzle) is $M=1$.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the effect on Mach number (M). Since the nozzle is already choked (M=1 at the exit), increasing the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) further will not change the Mach number at the exit. The flow cannot accelerate beyond sonic speed in a convergent nozzle. Thus, $M$ remains constant.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the effect on static temperature (T). For isentropic flow, the static temperature at the choked exit ($T$) is related to the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) by the formula: $T = T_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)$. The problem states that only the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) is increased, implying $T_0$ remains constant. Since $\\gamma$ is also constant for a perfect gas, $T$ at the exit remains constant.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect on velocity (u). The velocity at the choked exit is the speed of sound, $u = a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$. As established in Steps 2 and 3, $M$ (and thus the condition of being sonic) and $T$ (static temperature) remain constant. Since $\\gamma$ and $R$ are also constants, the exit velocity $u$ remains constant.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the effect on static pressure (p). For isentropic flow at the choked exit, the static pressure ($p$) is related to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) by: $p = P_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$. Since $P_0$ is increased and the term $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$ is a constant (the critical pressure ratio), the static pressure $p$ at the exit must increase proportionally with $P_0$.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the effect on density ($\\rho$). Using the ideal gas law, $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$. From Step 5, $p$ increases, and from Step 3, $T$ remains constant. Since $R$ is also constant, the density $\\rho$ at the exit must increase.",
          "Step 7: Combine the results. u, M, and T remain the same, while p and $\\rho$ increase. This corresponds to option C."
