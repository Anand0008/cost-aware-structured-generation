        "reasoning": "For a choked convergent nozzle (exit Mach number M=1), increasing reservoir pressure (P0) while keeping stagnation temperature (T0) constant has specific effects derived from isentropic flow relations and the choked mass flow rate equation. The exit Mach number (M) is fixed at 1 by the geometry (choked condition). The exit static temperature (T) is tied to T0 via the isentropic relation $T = T_0 / (1 + (\\gamma-1)M^2/2)$, so with constant T0 and M=1, T remains constant. The speed of sound $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$ is thus constant, and since exit velocity $u = M \\cdot a$, u remains constant. The exit static pressure (p) is the critical pressure $p^* = P_0 \\cdot (2/(\\gamma+1))^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$, so p increases proportionally with P0. Density $\\rho = p/(R T)$ increases proportionally with p since T is constant. This matches option C: u, M, T constant; p, ρ increase. RAG Chunk 3 explicitly discusses that for a choked convergent nozzle, increasing P0 keeps M=1, increases mass flow rate, and increases exit pressure (which is P*), supporting this analysis."
