        "reasoning": "The nozzle is convergent only and is already operating in a choked condition at the exit (M = 1 at the exit). The ambient pressure is fixed (atmosphere), and the reservoir stagnation temperature T\\_0 is given as a constant; we increase only the reservoir stagnation pressure P\\_0.\n\nFor a convergent nozzle exhausting to fixed back pressure, choking occurs when P\\_0/P\\_b exceeds the critical value. Once choked, the Mach number at the exit is fixed at M = 1 (for a convergent nozzle, the throat and exit are the same). The Mach number distribution in the nozzle is determined purely by geometry and does not change when only P\\_0 is varied.\n\nIsentropic relations for a given Mach number show that the ratios T/T\\_0 and p/P\\_0 depend only on M and \\gamma. Since M and T\\_0 are unchanged, T/T\\_0 is constant, so T stays the same even though P\\_0 changes. Similarly, p/P\\_0 is constant, so p increases in direct proportion to P\\_0. Density is given by \\rho = p/(R T); with p increasing and T constant, \\rho increases.\n\nThe exit velocity is u = M a = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}. With M and T fixed, a is constant, so u remains the same. Therefore, when P\\_0 is increased (with T\\_0 fixed) in a choked convergent nozzle, u, M, and T remain unchanged, while p and \\rho increase. This matches option C."

While not tailored exactly to this specific MCQ, the concepts of choked flow, isentropic relations, and dependence of mass flow on P0 were directly relevant and supported the reasoning. Some chunks discussed convergent-divergent nozzles and back pressure effects, which are related but not central here."
