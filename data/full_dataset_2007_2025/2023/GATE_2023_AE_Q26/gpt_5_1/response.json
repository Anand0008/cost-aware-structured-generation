        "reasoning": "Option A: By definition, the maximum (major) principal stress is the algebraically largest normal (direct) stress at a point. This matches standard definitions in mechanics of materials and aircraft structures texts.\n\nOption B: This is false because \"magnitude\" refers to absolute value. It is possible that the minor principal stress is compressive with a larger absolute value than the tensile major principal stress. For example, \\(\\sigma_1 = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\) (tension), \\(\\sigma_2 = -100\\,\\text{MPa}\\) (compression). Algebraically, \\(\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2\\), so 50 MPa is the major principal stress, but the magnitude of the minor principal stress (100 MPa) is greater than that of the major principal stress (50 MPa). Megson explicitly notes this possibility.\n\nOption C: From Mohr's circle and standard stress transformation theory, planes of maximum in-plane shear are oriented at 45 degrees to the principal planes in the physical element. On Mohr's circle this corresponds to a 90-degree separation, but in the material it is 45 degrees, not 90 degrees. So C is false.\n\nOption D: On planes of maximum in-plane shear, the normal stress is always equal to the average normal stress \\(\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)/2\\). Since both maximum-shear planes share this same normal stress, the normal stresses along the planes of maximum shear stress are equal. This is clearly stated in the RAG chunks on Mohr's circle and maximum shear stress.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and D, matching the official key."
