        "reasoning": "The analysis of each option, supported by the retrieved knowledge, confirms that statements A and D are true, while B and C are false. \\n\\n**Option A:** 'Maximum or major principal stress is algebraically the largest direct stress at a point.' This is a fundamental definition. RAG Chunk 4 states, '$\\sigma_I$ represents the algebraically greatest stress, while $\\sigma_{II}$ is the algebraically least.' RAG Chunk 3 also notes, 'always remember $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2$', where $\\sigma_1$ is the major principal stress. Thus, statement A is **TRUE**.\\n\\n**Option B:** 'The magnitude of minor principal stress cannot be greater than the magnitude of major principal stress.' RAG Chunk 4 explicitly clarifies this: 'if one stress is tensile (positive) and the other is compressive (negative), the minor principal stress $\\sigma_{II}$ could have a larger numerical magnitude than the major principal stress $\\sigma_I$.' For example, if $\\sigma_1 = 10 \\text{ MPa}$ and $\\sigma_2 = -20 \\text{ MPa}$, then algebraically $\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2$, but $|\\sigma_2| = 20 \\text{ MPa}$ which is greater than $|\\sigma_1| = 10 \\text{ MPa}$. Thus, statement B is **FALSE**.\\n\\n**Option C:** 'The planes of maximum shear stress are inclined at 90 degrees to the principal axes.' RAG Chunk 1 states, 'The planes of maximum shear stress are always oriented at 45 degrees to the principal planes.' RAG Chunk 2 further explains, 'The planes of maximum shear stress are oriented 45 degrees from the principal planes... On Mohr's Circle, this corresponds to a 90-degree rotation from the principal stress points.' The 90-degree rotation is on Mohr's Circle (representing $2\\theta$), which corresponds to a 45-degree rotation in the physical plane ($\\theta$). Thus, statement C is **FALSE**.\\n\\n**Option D:** 'The normal stresses along the planes of maximum shear stress are equal.' RAG Chunk 2 states, 'Normal Stress on Planes of Maximum Shear: This is the stress value at the center of the Mohr's Circle on the $\\sigma$ axis. $\\sigma_{avg} = C$.' RAG Chunk 3 reiterates, 'The normal stress accompanying $\\tau_{max}$ is always the average normal stress: $\\sigma_{avg} = (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) / 2$.' Since there is only one value for the average normal stress, the normal stresses on both planes of maximum shear stress are equal to this average normal stress. Thus, statement D is **TRUE**."

This normal stress is always equal to the average normal stress, which is the center of Mohr's Circle.
