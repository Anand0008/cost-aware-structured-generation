        "reasoning": "The condition for longitudinal static stability is dC_m/dα < 0 (Chunk 2). For a statically stable aircraft, an increase in absolute angle of attack (α_a) must generate a nose-down (restoring) pitching moment. Since nose-up moment is defined as positive, a restoring moment for increased α is negative, meaning C_m must decrease as α_a increases. Graph A (positive slope from origin) shows C_m increasing with α_a, indicating instability. Graph C also has a positive slope (increasing, starting negative). The correct graph must have a negative slope (C_m decreasing with α_a). Graph D (the correct answer) is inferred to have this negative slope. Furthermore, the trimmed condition (C_m=0) occurs at a specific α_a, so the line should cross the horizontal axis, which is consistent with a negatively sloped line not necessarily passing through the origin (as shown in Figure 7.13 of Anderson, Chunk 3)."

          "Step 1: Recall the fundamental criterion for longitudinal static stability: The slope of the pitching moment coefficient versus angle of attack curve must be negative, i.e., $dC_m/d\\alpha < 0$ (Chunk 2). This ensures a restoring moment after a perturbation.",
          "Step 2: Understand the variables. The question uses the coefficient of pitching moment about the CG ($C_{m_{cg}}$) and the absolute angle of attack ($\\alpha_a$). The absolute angle of attack is defined as $\\alpha_a = \\alpha + |\\alpha_{L=0}|$, where $\\alpha$ is geometric angle of attack (Chunk 5). The derivative with respect to $\\alpha_a$ has the same sign as with respect to $\\alpha$ because they differ by a constant.",
          "Step 3: Apply the stability condition to the graph. For a statically stable aircraft, as $\\alpha_a$ increases, $C_{m_{cg}}$ must decrease to provide a nose-down restoring moment (since nose-up is positive). Therefore, the correct graph must have a negative slope ($dC_m/d\\alpha_a < 0$).",
          "Step 4: Analyze the given graph descriptions. Graph A has a positive slope (upward to the right from origin), which corresponds to $dC_m/d\\alpha_a > 0$, indicating instability. Graph C also has a positive slope (upward, starting below origin). Thus, A and C are incorrect.",
          "Step 5: Identify the correct graph. The correct graph (D) must have a negative slope. Typically, the $C_m$ vs. $\\alpha_a$ line for a stable aircraft is a straight line with negative slope, crossing the horizontal axis at the trim angle of attack where $C_m=0$ (Chunk 3, Figure 7.13)."
