        "reasoning": "For longitudinal static stability, the condition is that an increase in angle of attack must produce a restoring (nose-down) pitching moment. With the convention that nose-up moment is positive, a restoring nose-down moment is negative. Therefore the slope of the pitching moment coefficient about the center of gravity with respect to angle of attack must be negative: \\(\\frac{dC_{m,\\mathrm{cg}}}{d\\alpha_a} < 0\\). From the RAG context (chunks 2 and 3), a negative slope of the \\(C_m\\) versus \\(\\alpha\\) curve corresponds to static stability, while a positive slope corresponds to instability. Among the four graphs, only Graphs B and D have negative slopes. However, the question uses absolute angle of attack \\(\\alpha_a\\), for which lift is zero at \\(\\alpha_a = 0\\). For a typical statically stable, trimmed aircraft at some positive \\(\\alpha_a\\), the moment coefficient at zero absolute angle of attack need not be zero and is usually positive (nose-up) so that as \\(\\alpha_a\\) increases, \\(C_m\\) crosses zero at the trim point. Graph D shows a line with negative slope that is positive at \\(\\alpha_a = 0\\) and crosses the axis at a positive \\(\\alpha_a\\), matching the standard stable, trimmed behavior illustrated in Anderson: \\(C_m\\) decreases with \\(\\alpha\\) and passes through zero at the equilibrium angle. Graph B, in contrast, has a negative slope but is zero at \\(\\alpha_a = 0\\) and becomes negative for any positive \\(\\alpha_a\\), which would not allow a positive trimmed \\(\\alpha_a\\) with \\(C_m = 0\\). Therefore Graph D correctly represents a longitudinally statically stable aircraft."

          "Step 1: Recall the definition of longitudinal static stability: after a small pitch-up (increase in angle of attack), the aircraft must develop a nose-down restoring moment, and vice versa.",
          "Step 2: With the sign convention given, nose-up pitching moment is positive. Hence a restoring nose-down moment corresponds to a negative change in \\(C_{m,\\mathrm{cg}}\\) when \\(\\alpha_a\\) increases.",
          "Step 3: Mathematically, this requires the slope of the pitching moment coefficient with respect to angle of attack to be negative: \\(\\frac{dC_{m,\\mathrm{cg}}}{d\\alpha_a} < 0\\).",
          "Step 4: Inspect the four graphs: A and C have positive slopes (\\(C_m\\) increases with \\(\\alpha_a\\)), which implies static instability. B and D have negative slopes, satisfying the stability condition.",
          "Step 5: Consider trimming: a realistic stable aircraft should have some positive equilibrium \\(\\alpha_a\\) where \\(C_{m,\\mathrm{cg}} = 0\\). Graph D shows a negative-slope line that is positive at \\(\\alpha_a = 0\\) and crosses zero at a positive \\(\\alpha_a\\), matching this behavior. Graph B is zero at \\(\\alpha_a = 0\\) and becomes negative for any positive \\(\\alpha_a\\), so there is no positive trim angle.",
