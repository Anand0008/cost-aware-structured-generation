However, the context uses Earth-specific parameters (g0, R0) and the form $u_e = \\sqrt{2g_0 R_0^2 / (R_0 + h)}$. The question requires the more general form $u_e = \\sqrt{2 G M / R}$, which is also mentioned in the context via $\\mu = G M$. The RAG was sufficient to confirm the formula and conceptual basis, though the specific numbers for Mars-like planet were not present."
