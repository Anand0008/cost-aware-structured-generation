Additional gas dynamics content on compressible Pitot relations was not needed but confirmed broader context."

The differential pressure reading from the pitot-static tubes is 3 kPa for both the airplanes. Assuming incompressible flow, the ratio of cruise speeds of Airplane A to Airplane B is ______.
