The free stream density and static pressure at altitude 2 km are 1.01 kg/m³ and 79.50 kPa, respectively, and at altitude 4 km, they are 0.82 kg/m³ and 61.70 kPa, respectively. The differential pressure reading from the pitot-static tubes is 3 kPa for both the airplanes. Assuming incompressible flow, the ratio of cruise speeds of Airplane A to Airplane B is ______. (round off to two decimal places)"
