        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify all true statements regarding turbofan engines with afterburners. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Turning afterburner ON increases specific fuel consumption.**\n*   Specific fuel consumption (SFC) is defined as the fuel flow rate per unit of thrust. Afterburners achieve thrust augmentation by injecting and burning additional fuel in the exhaust stream downstream of the turbine. This combustion occurs at lower pressures and is less efficient than in the main combustor. As a result, while thrust increases significantly, the fuel consumption increases disproportionately, leading to a much higher SFC (often 3-5 times higher than dry operation). This is a well-known characteristic and a major drawback of afterburners, limiting their use to short durations. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, 5) explicitly states, 'Afterburners... are extremely fuel-inefficient (often consuming 3-5 times more fuel per unit thrust than dry operation)'.\n*   Therefore, statement A is TRUE.\n\n**Option B: Turbofan engines with afterburners have variable area nozzles.**\n*   When the afterburner is engaged, the exhaust gas temperature and volume flow rate increase dramatically due to the additional heat release. To efficiently expand these much hotter and higher volume gases, maintain optimal engine operation (e.g., prevent compressor stall or choke), and achieve maximum thrust, the nozzle exit area must be increased. A fixed-area nozzle would lead to excessive back pressure, reduced mass flow, and potentially compressor instability. Therefore, a variable area nozzle (VAN) is a mandatory component for afterburning engines, allowing the nozzle area to adjust to different operating conditions (afterburner ON/OFF). The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) consistently emphasizes the necessity of variable area nozzles for afterburning engines. For example, Chunk 4 states, 'A variable-area nozzle is a mandatory component for an afterburning engine.'\n*   Therefore, statement B is TRUE.\n\n**Option C: Turning afterburner ON decreases specific fuel consumption.**\n*   This statement directly contradicts statement A. As established, afterburners significantly increase SFC due to their high fuel consumption for the thrust produced. Therefore, statement C is FALSE.\n\n**Option D: Turning afterburner ON increases stagnation pressure across the engine.**\n*   The afterburner is a combustion chamber located after the turbine. While it significantly increases the stagnation temperature (`T_0`), combustion processes inherently involve pressure losses due to friction, mixing, and heat addition (similar to Rayleigh flow in a duct, which shows a decrease in stagnation pressure for heat addition in subsonic flow). Therefore, the stagnation pressure typically *decreases* across the afterburner section. The overall stagnation pressure ratio across the entire engine (from inlet to exit) would not increase due to afterburning; rather, the stagnation pressure at the afterburner exit would be lower than at its inlet. The primary goal of an afterburner is to increase exhaust velocity by increasing `T_0`, not `P_0`. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 3, 4) mentions pressure *buildup* if the nozzle doesn't open, which is an adverse effect, not a desired increase in stagnation pressure across the engine.\n*   Therefore, statement D is FALSE.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and B are true."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of an afterburner in a turbofan engine. An afterburner is a secondary combustion chamber located downstream of the turbine, designed to provide a temporary thrust boost by burning additional fuel in the hot, oxygen-rich exhaust gases.",
          "Step 2: Evaluate the effect of afterburner operation on specific fuel consumption (SFC). Recall that SFC is a measure of fuel efficiency. Afterburners are known to be highly fuel-inefficient due to combustion occurring at lower pressures and less optimized conditions, leading to a significant increase in fuel consumption for the thrust produced. Thus, turning the afterburner ON increases SFC.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate the necessity of a variable area nozzle with an afterburner. When the afterburner is active, the exhaust gas temperature and volume flow rate increase substantially. A variable area nozzle is required to adjust the exhaust area to efficiently expand these hotter, higher-volume gases, prevent excessive back pressure, and maintain stable engine operation (avoiding compressor stall).",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the effect of afterburner operation on stagnation pressure across the engine. Combustion, including in an afterburner, is an irreversible process that typically results in a decrease in stagnation pressure due to friction and heat addition. While stagnation temperature increases, stagnation pressure generally decreases across the afterburner section, not increases across the entire engine.",
