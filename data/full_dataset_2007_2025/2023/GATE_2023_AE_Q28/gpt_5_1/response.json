        "reasoning": "Option A: Turning the afterburner ON injects extra fuel downstream of the turbine at relatively low pressure, giving a large thrust increase but an even larger increase in fuel flow per unit thrust. Hence thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) or specific fuel consumption increases. This is standard: afterburning is highly fuel-inefficient. So A is true.\nOption B: When afterburner is ON, exhaust gas temperature and specific volume rise sharply, so for roughly similar mass flow the volumetric flow rate increases. To avoid excessive back-pressure and compressor stall, the nozzle exit area must increase. Therefore afterburning turbofans/turbojets use variable area nozzles. This is emphasized in the RAG: variable geometry is mandatory for afterburning engines. So B is true.\nOption C: States the opposite of A, so it is false.\nOption D: Afterburner adds heat at (approximately) the same stagnation pressure or with some loss; it does not increase stagnation pressure. In real engines, stagnation pressure slightly decreases across the afterburner due to friction and losses. So D is false.\nTherefore the correct set of true statements is A and B, matching the official key."

They also highlighted that afterburners are fuel-inefficient and require variable geometry nozzles to avoid back-pressure and compressor stall. This directly supported evaluating options A, B, and D. No significant gaps for this conceptual question."
