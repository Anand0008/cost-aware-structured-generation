        "reasoning": "The official answer key (A, B) aligns with core propulsion principles. Option A: Afterburner operation significantly increases fuel flow rate for a proportionally smaller thrust gain, worsening Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Option B: A variable area nozzle is a mandatory design feature to accommodate the large increase in exhaust gas volume/temperature when afterburner is engaged, preventing compressor stall and ensuring efficient expansion. Option C: Contradicts A; afterburner increases SFC. Option D: Afterburner adds heat at nearly constant stagnation pressure; it does not increase stagnation pressure across the engine; there may even be a small pressure loss due to combustion inefficiencies and friction."

          "Step 1: Understand the context - Turbofan engines with afterburners are common in military aircraft (e.g., F-15, Su-27) for thrust augmentation.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Option A (Turning afterburner ON increases specific fuel consumption). Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) is fuel flow rate per unit thrust ($\\text{SFC} = \\dot{m}_f / F$). Afterburner combustion occurs at low pressure in the exhaust duct, which is thermodynamically less efficient than the main combustor. The fuel flow increase ($\\Delta \\dot{m}_{f,AB}$) is large relative to the thrust increase ($\\Delta F$), leading to a net increase in SFC. This is a well-known trade-off.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Option B (Turbofan engines with afterburners have variable area nozzles). When the afterburner is ON, exhaust gas stagnation temperature ($T_{0,e}$) rises dramatically. For a choked nozzle, mass flow $\\dot{m} \\propto A_e P_{0,e} / \\sqrt{T_{0,e}}$. To maintain the required mass flow and prevent a pressure rise upstream (which could cause compressor stall), the exit area $A_e$ must increase. Hence, a mechanically variable area nozzle is essential.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option C (Turning afterburner ON decreases specific fuel consumption). This is the opposite of Option A and is false. Afterburners are used when thrust is prioritized over efficiency; they are fuel-thirsty.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option D (Turning afterburner ON increases stagnation pressure across the engine). The afterburner is a constant-pressure combustion process (idealized). In reality, there is a stagnation pressure loss due to friction, mixing, and combustion inefficiency. It does not increase the overall engine stagnation pressure; the main increase is in stagnation temperature. The compressor and turbine determine the core pressure rise; the afterburner is downstream."
