        "reasoning": "The question asks to select all true statements about turbofan engines with afterburners. \n\nOption A is correct: Turning the afterburner ON increases the specific fuel consumption (SFC) of the engine. This is because the afterburner burns additional fuel to increase thrust, but the thrust increase is not proportional to the fuel increase, leading to a higher SFC.\n\nOption B is correct: Turbofan engines with afterburners require variable area nozzles. When the afterburner is turned ON, the exhaust temperature and volume flow rate increase significantly. To maintain efficient expansion of the hot, low-density exhaust and prevent compressor stall, the nozzle area must be increased.\n\nOption C is incorrect: Turning the afterburner ON decreases the specific fuel consumption, which is the opposite of what happens in reality.\n\nOption D is incorrect: Turning the afterburner ON increases the stagnation temperature of the exhaust, but it does not increase the stagnation pressure across the engine. The stagnation pressure may actually decrease due to the additional pressure losses in the afterburner duct."
