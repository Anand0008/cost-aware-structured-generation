        "reasoning": "A shape can tile (tessellate) a flat plane if identical copies of it can completely cover the plane without any gaps or overlaps, extending to infinity. This property depends on the geometric characteristics of the shape, particularly its angles.\n\n1.  **A. Circle:** Circles cannot tile a plane without leaving empty spaces (gaps) between them, regardless of how they are packed. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n2.  **B. Regular octagon:** For a regular polygon to tile a plane on its own, its interior angle must be an integer divisor of $360^\\circ$. The interior angle of a regular n-sided polygon is given by the formula $\\frac{(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{n}$. For a regular octagon (n=8), the interior angle is $\\frac{(8-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{8} = \\frac{6 \\times 180^\\circ}{8} = \\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = 135^\\circ$. Since $360^\\circ / 135^\\circ \\approx 2.67$, which is not an integer, regular octagons cannot tile a plane by themselves. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n3.  **C. Regular pentagon:** For a regular pentagon (n=5), the interior angle is $\\frac{(5-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 180^\\circ}{5} = \\frac{540^\\circ}{5} = 108^\\circ$. Since $360^\\circ / 108^\\circ \\approx 3.33$, which is not an integer, regular pentagons cannot tile a plane. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n4.  **D. Rhombus:** A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral (a four-sided polygon with all sides of equal length). A fundamental theorem in geometry states that *any* quadrilateral (convex or non-convex) can tile a plane. This is because the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$. By arranging copies of the quadrilateral such that all four angles meet at a common vertex, or more generally by rotating the quadrilateral $180^\\circ$ around the midpoint of each of its sides, a complete tessellation can always be formed. Therefore, a rhombus can tile a flat plane. This makes option D the correct answer."
