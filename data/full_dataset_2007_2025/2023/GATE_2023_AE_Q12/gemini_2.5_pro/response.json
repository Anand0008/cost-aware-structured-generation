        "reasoning": "The question states that the function $y = f(x)$ is both monotonic and continuous, and it has exactly one root in the open interval $x_1 < x < x_2$. Let's analyze these conditions:\n\n1.  **Continuity:** A continuous function means its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen. This is a crucial condition for the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A monotonic function is one that is either always increasing or always decreasing over the given interval. This property ensures that if the function crosses the x-axis, it can do so only once.\n3.  **Exactly one root in $(x_1, x_2)$:** This means there is a unique value $c$ such that $x_1 < c < x_2$ and $f(c) = 0$.\n\nAccording to the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)** (as highlighted in RAG Chunk 3, which discusses bracketing methods for roots), if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[x_1, x_2]$ and $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs, then there must exist at least one root $c$ in the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $f(c) = 0$. The condition for opposite signs is mathematically expressed as $f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0$.\n\nThe additional condition of **monotonicity** (RAG Chunk 1) ensures that if the function changes sign (i.e., crosses the x-axis), it can only do so once. If $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ had the same sign (e.g., both positive or both negative), a monotonic function would never cross the x-axis within the interval, thus having no root. If $f(x_1)$ or $f(x_2)$ were zero, the root would be at the boundary, not strictly *within* the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nTherefore, for a continuous and monotonic function to have exactly one root in the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$, it is necessary that $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs. This corresponds to option C: $f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0$."

          "Step 2: Identify the core problem: The function has exactly one root in the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$. A root is a point $c$ where $f(c) = 0$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). For a continuous function $f(x)$ on $[x_1, x_2]$, if $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs, then there must be at least one root $c$ in $(x_1, x_2)$. This condition is expressed as $f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0$.",
          "Step 4: Incorporate the monotonicity condition. If a function is monotonic and continuous, and it changes sign over an interval, it can cross the x-axis only once. This ensures the *uniqueness* of the root, which matches the problem statement of having 'only one root'.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n    *   A. $f(x_1)f(x_2) > 0$: This implies $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have the same sign. A monotonic function with the same sign at its endpoints cannot have a root in between.\n    *   B. $f(x_1)f(x_2) = 0$: This implies either $f(x_1) = 0$ or $f(x_2) = 0$. If so, the root would be at an endpoint, not strictly *within* the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$.\n    *   C. $f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0$: This implies $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs. For a continuous and monotonic function, this guarantees exactly one root in $(x_1, x_2)$.\n    *   D. $f(x_1) - f(x_2) = 0$: This implies $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Similar to option A, if $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\neq 0$, a monotonic function cannot have a root in $(x_1, x_2)$. If $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0$, it contradicts the root being strictly in $(x_1, x_2)$.",
