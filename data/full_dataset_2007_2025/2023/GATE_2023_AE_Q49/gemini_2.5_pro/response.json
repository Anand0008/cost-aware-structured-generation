        "reasoning": "The problem involves a rigid bar pinned at one end and supported by an inclined deformable rod, subjected to a uniformly distributed load. The solution requires a sequence of steps:\n1.  **Convert the Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) to an equivalent concentrated force:** The UDL of 100 N/m acts over the entire 2m length of bar AB. The total upward force is $F_{UDL} = 100 \\text{ N/m} \\times 2 \\text{ m} = 200 \\text{ N}$. This force acts at the centroid of the UDL, which is at the midpoint of AB, precisely at point D (1m from A).\n2.  **Determine the geometry of rod CD:** Point D is at (1m, 0) relative to A. Point C is at (0, -1m) relative to A. The length of rod CD is $L_{CD} = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\text{ m}$. The angle the rod CD makes with the vertical (and horizontal) is $45^\\circ$.\n3.  **Apply static equilibrium to the rigid bar AB:** The bar is pinned at A. Taking moments about A ($M_A = 0$):\n    The upward UDL creates a counter-clockwise moment: $+F_{UDL} \\times (1 \\text{ m}) = +200 \\text{ N} \\times 1 \\text{ m}$.\n    To balance this, the rod CD must exert a force that creates a clockwise moment. This means the vertical component of the force in rod CD ($F_{CD_y}$) must act downwards at D. Therefore, rod CD is in tension.\n    $200 \\text{ N} \\times 1 \\text{ m} - F_{CD_y} \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 0$\n    Since the angle of rod CD with the vertical is $45^\\circ$, $F_{CD_y} = F_{CD} \\cos(45^\\circ)$.\n    $200 - F_{CD} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\n    $F_{CD} = \\frac{200}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{200}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}$. This is the tensile force in rod CD.\n4.  **Calculate the elongation of rod CD:** The axial stiffness of rod CD is $k_{CD} = 40 \\text{ N/mm}$.\n    The elongation $\\delta_{CD} = \\frac{F_{CD}}{k_{CD}} = \\frac{200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}}{40 \\text{ N/mm}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm}$.\n5.  **Relate the elongation of rod CD to the vertical deflection at D:** Since the rigid bar is pinned at A, it rotates about A. The elongation $\\delta_{CD}$ of the rod is the component of the vertical displacement of D along the line of the rod. If $\\delta_{D_{vertical}}$ is the vertical deflection at D, and the rod makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the vertical, then:\n    $\\delta_{CD} = \\delta_{D_{vertical}} \\cos(45^\\circ)$\n    Therefore, $\\delta_{D_{vertical}} = \\frac{\\delta_{CD}}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm}}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n6.  **Round off to the nearest integer:** The vertical deflection at point D is 10 mm."

          "name": "Virtual Work Method",
          "description": "This method involves applying a virtual unit load at the point and in the direction where deflection is desired. The internal forces due to the real load and the virtual load are calculated for each member. The total deflection is then found by summing the product of these forces, member length, and inverse of axial rigidity ($L/AE$) for all members, or by using the stiffness directly. For a single member, $\\delta = \\sum \\frac{F_{real} F_{virtual} L}{AE}$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Very powerful for complex structures (trusses, frames) and for finding deflections at multiple points or rotations. Cons: Can be more involved for simple problems, requires calculating both real and virtual internal forces.",
          "when_to_use": "More suitable for complex truss structures or when multiple deflections/rotations are required. For a simple rigid bar with one deformable member, the direct equilibrium and compatibility method is usually faster."
