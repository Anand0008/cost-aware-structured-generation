        "reasoning": "From the figure: AB is a 2 m rigid horizontal bar, pinned at A on the wall. Point D is at the midspan (1 m from A). A straight rod CD connects the lower wall point C (1 m below A) to D. The bar carries a uniformly distributed load of 100 N/m over its 2 m length, so the total load is 200 N acting at the midspan, i.e., at D. The bar is rigid, so vertical displacement at D equals the vertical displacement of joint C projected along the bar rotation. However, because A is a pin support on the wall and the only other connection is the axial rod CD at D, the bar will rotate slightly about A and the rod will carry the entire 200 N as an axial force. Taking moments about A for the rigid bar: the distributed load is equivalent to a 200 N downward force at 1 m from A; the rod force at D has a vertical component balancing this moment. But since the rod is the only other connection, its axial force must be such that its vertical component equals 200 N. Geometry: A is at (0,0), B at (2,0), D at (1,0), C at (0,-1). Thus CD has length $L = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ m and makes 45\\(^\\circ$) to the horizontal and vertical. Let the axial tension in CD be $T$. Its vertical component at D is $T \\sin 45^\\circ$. For vertical equilibrium of the bar: $T \\sin 45^\\circ = 200$ N, so $T = 200/\\sin 45^\\circ = 200 \\sqrt{2} \\approx 282.8$ N. The axial stiffness of CD is given as 40 N/mm, i.e., $k = 40$ N/mm in axial direction, so the axial extension of CD is $\\delta_L = T/k = 282.8 / 40 \\approx 7.07$ mm. This extension occurs along the rod; the vertical displacement of point D is the vertical component of this extension: $\\delta_D = \\delta_L \\sin 45^\\circ = 7.07 \\times (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\approx 5$ mm downward. However, this ignores the fact that the bar is pinned at A and the rod force must also satisfy moment equilibrium about A. Doing the full rigid-body equilibrium: take moments about A. The 200 N resultant at 1 m creates a clockwise moment of $200 \\times 1 = 200$ N m. The force at D from the rod has both horizontal and vertical components. Only its vertical component $T \\sin 45^\\circ$ at 1 m from A contributes to moment: counterclockwise moment $T \\sin 45^\\circ \\times 1$. Setting sum of moments zero: $T \\sin 45^\\circ = 200$ N, which is the same equation as vertical equilibrium, so the previous value of $T$ is consistent. The vertical displacement of D due to rotation about A is related to the rotation angle $\\theta$ by $v_D = \\theta \\times 1$ (for small angles). The axial extension of CD is related to $\\theta$ by compatibility: the relative displacement between C and D along the rod direction equals $\\delta_L$. For small rotation, the vertical displacement of D is $v_D$, horizontal displacement is negligible compared to vertical for small angles, so the component of D's displacement along CD is approximately $v_D \\cos 45^\\circ$. Thus $\\delta_L \\approx v_D \\cos 45^\\circ$. Using $\\delta_L = T/k$ and $T = 200/\\sin 45^\\circ$, we get $v_D = \\delta_L/\\cos 45^\\circ = (T/k)/\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{200}{\\sin 45^\\circ} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k \\cos 45^\\circ} = \\frac{200}{k \\sin 45^\\circ \\cos 45^\\circ} = \\frac{200}{k (1/2) \\sin 90^\\circ} = \\frac{400}{k}$. With $k = 40$ N/mm, $v_D = 400/40 = 10$ mm. This matches the official answer range 10 to 10 mm. The earlier 5 mm estimate was from an oversimplified projection; the correct compatibility uses the rotation of the rigid bar and the direction of the rod, giving 10 mm."

Express the vertical displacement at D in terms of bar rotation, then write force in the spring as k times its axial extension (projection of D's displacement along CD). Combine with equilibrium to solve for rotation and deflection.",

However, it did not contain this exact geometry or the specific 40 N/mm stiffness, so the detailed numerical solution relied mainly on internal structural mechanics knowledge."
