        "reasoning": "The sentence 'You are delaying the completion of the task. Send _______ contributions at the earliest.' requires a possessive adjective to modify the noun 'contributions'.\n\n- Option A, 'you are', is a subject pronoun followed by a verb. It does not fit grammatically before a noun to show possession.\n- Option B, 'your', is a possessive adjective. It correctly indicates that the 'contributions' belong to 'you'. This fits the context perfectly.\n- Option C, 'you\\u2019re', is a contraction of 'you are'. Similar to 'you are', it is not a possessive adjective and does not fit before 'contributions'.\n- Option D, 'yore', is a noun referring to a long time past (e.g., 'days of yore'). It is completely out of context and grammatically incorrect here.\n\nTherefore, 'your' is the only grammatically correct and contextually appropriate option."
