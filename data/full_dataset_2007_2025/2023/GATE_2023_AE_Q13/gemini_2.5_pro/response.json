          "Step 2: Apply the method of characteristics. For a PDE of the form $A \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + B \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = C$, the characteristic equations are $\\frac{dx}{A} = \\frac{dt}{B} = \\frac{du}{C}$. In this problem, $A=1$, $B=1$, and $C=0$.",
          "Step 3: Formulate and solve the characteristic ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From $\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dt}{1}$, we get $dx = dt$. Integrating this yields $x - t = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. From $\\frac{du}{0}$, we get $du = 0$, which implies $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves.",
          "Step 4: Determine the general solution. Since $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves $x - t = C_1$, the solution $u(x, t)$ must be an arbitrary function of $C_1$. Thus, the general solution is $u(x, t) = f(x - t)$ for some arbitrary differentiable function $f$.",
          "Step 5: Use the initial condition to find the specific form of the function $f$. The initial condition is given as $u(x, 0) = e^{{-x^2}}$. Substitute $t=0$ into the general solution: $u(x, 0) = f(x - 0) = f(x)$. Comparing this with the initial condition, we deduce that $f(x) = e^{{-x^2}}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the determined function $f$ back into the general solution. Replacing $f$ with its specific form, and using $(x-t)$ as its argument, the solution becomes $u(x, t) = e^{{-(x-t)^2}}$.",

While the concept of characteristics was mentioned for the second-order case, the specific first-order advection equation ($u_t + u_x = 0$) and its solution via the method of characteristics were not directly covered with relevant formulas or derivations. Therefore, the solution relied heavily on internal knowledge of first-order PDEs. The RAG context was not directly helpful for solving this specific problem."
