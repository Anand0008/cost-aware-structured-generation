This speed is the 'corner velocity' (V*), where the aircraft simultaneously achieves its maximum permissible load factor (structural limit) and its maximum lift coefficient (aerodynamic stall limit). The formula for corner velocity is derived from the lift equation under maximum conditions: $n_{max} W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^{*2} S C_{L,max}$. Solving for $V^*$ yields $V^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 n_{max} (W/S)}{\\rho C_{L,max}}}$. Plugging in the given values ($n_{max}=7$, $W/S=6500 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $\\rho=1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $C_{L,max}=2$) gives $V^* \\approx 192.3 \\text{ m/s}$, which rounds to 192 m/s.

Substitute to get $\\omega = \\frac{g}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\rho V^2 C_L}{2(W/S)} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{g\\rho C_L V}{2(W/S)} - \\frac{g}{V}$. To maximize ω with respect to V for a given C_L (≤ C_L,max), take derivative dω/dV and set to zero. However, the constraint n ≤ n_max also applies. The maximum occurs at the limit where both constraints are active, leading again to the corner velocity condition.",
