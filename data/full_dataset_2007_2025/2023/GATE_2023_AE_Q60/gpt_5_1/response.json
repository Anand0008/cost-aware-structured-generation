For a pull-up, the load factor is n = L/W, with L = 0.5 \\rho V^2 S C_L. At the maneuver point, n = n_max and C_L = C_{L\\max}. Eliminating W/S gives the speed: V^2 = 2 n_max (W/S) / (\\rho C_{L\\max}). Substituting n_max = 7, W/S = 6500 N/m^2, \\rho = 1.23 kg/m^3, C_{L\\max} = 2 yields V^2 = 36829.27, so V ≈ 191.9 m/s, which rounds to 192 m/s.
