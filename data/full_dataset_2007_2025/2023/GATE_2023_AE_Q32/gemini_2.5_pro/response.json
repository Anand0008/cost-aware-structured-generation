For horizontal acceleration, the horizontal load factor `n_x` is defined as `a_x / g`, where `g` is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n4.  **Express mass in terms of weight:** We know that `W = m g`, so `m = W / g`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and solve for `n_x`:**\n    `F_horizontal = (W/g) a_x`\n    `F_horizontal = W (a_x / g)`\n    `F_horizontal = W n_x`\n    Therefore, `n_x = F_horizontal / W`\n\n    Given $W = 40 \\text{ kN}$.\n    `n_x = \\frac{98.48 \\text{ kN}}{40 \\text{ kN}} = 2.462`\n\n6.  **Round off to one decimal place:**\n    `n_x \\approx 2.5`\n\nThis value falls within the specified range of 2.4 to 2.6."

The aircraft weight ($W$) is 40 kN, the arresting cable tension ($T$) is 100 kN, and the angle of the cable with the horizontal ($\\alpha$) is $10^\\circ$. Note the crucial assumption that engine thrust balances aerodynamic drag, meaning these forces do not contribute to the net horizontal acceleration.",
          "Step 2: Determine the net horizontal force acting on the aircraft. Since thrust balances drag, the only horizontal force causing deceleration is the horizontal component of the arresting cable tension. This component acts opposite to the direction of motion (retarding force).",
          "Step 3: Calculate the horizontal component of the tension force using trigonometry: $F_x = T \\cos(\\alpha)$. Substitute the given values: $F_x = 100 \\text{ kN} \\times \\cos(10^\\circ)$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the numerical value of $F_x$. $\\cos(10^\\circ) \\approx 0.9848$. So, $F_x = 100 \\text{ kN} \\times 0.9848 = 98.48 \\text{ kN}$.",
          "Step 5: Recall the definition of horizontal load factor ($n_x$). The load factor is the ratio of the actual acceleration to the acceleration due to gravity ($n_x = a_x/g$). From Newton's second law, the net horizontal force $F_x = m a_x$. Since $m = W/g$, we can write $F_x = (W/g) a_x = W (a_x/g) = W n_x$. Therefore, $n_x = F_x / W$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the calculated horizontal force and the given weight into the load factor equation: $n_x = \\frac{98.48 \\text{ kN}}{40 \\text{ kN}}$.",
          "Step 7: Perform the final calculation: $n_x = 2.462$.",
          "Step 8: Round off the result to one decimal place as required by the question: $n_x \\approx 2.5$."

Chunk 3 provided context on load factor derivation, though for a vertical maneuver. Chunks 1, 4, and 5 were less relevant (take-off forces, noise limits). The provided RAG context was sufficient to confirm the principles and definitions needed."

The tension in the arresting cable at a given instant, as shown in the figure, is 100 kN. Assuming that the thrust from the engine continues to balance airplane drag, the magnitude of horizontal load factor is ________. (round off to one decimal place)"
