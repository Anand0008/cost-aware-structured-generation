        "reasoning": "From Megson and the provided lecture notes, ribs in a semi-monocoque wing: (1) act as transverse supports to longitudinal stiffeners/stringers, thereby reducing their effective column length and increasing their critical buckling stress; (2) subdivide the wing skin into smaller panels, increasing the plate buckling stress of the skin; and (3) define and maintain the airfoil contour, i.e., the aerodynamic shape. These directly support statements B, C, and D. Statement A claims that for a rectangular planform wing, rib dimensions do not depend on spanwise position. In reality, loads and bending moments are highest near the root and decrease towards the tip, so ribs near the root are generally stronger, deeper, or more closely spaced than those near the tip. Thus rib dimensions do depend on spanwise position, making A false. Therefore, the official answer B, C, D is correct."

          "Step 3: Evaluate B: Ribs support longitudinal stiffeners at intervals, reducing their effective buckling length L. Since column buckling load is proportional to 1/L^2, this increases the allowable buckling stress. So B is true.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate C: By dividing the skin into smaller panels between ribs, the effective panel dimensions are reduced, which increases the critical plate buckling stress of the skin. So C is true.",

It explicitly mentioned ribs increasing column buckling stress of stiffeners, plate buckling stress of skin, and maintaining aerodynamic shape, which map directly to options B, C, and D. No significant gaps for this conceptual question."
