        "reasoning": "Based on the principles of aircraft structural design and the provided retrieved knowledge, statements B, C, and D accurately describe the functions of ribs in a semi-monocoque wing construction, while statement A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Statement A: For a rectangular planform wing, the dimensions of the ribs DO NOT depend on their spanwise position in the wing.** This statement is FALSE. Even for a rectangular planform, the internal loads (bending moments, shear forces, torsional loads) vary significantly along the wing span. Ribs are also designed to accommodate concentrated loads from components like engines, landing gear, and fuel tanks, which are located at specific spanwise positions. Consequently, the dimensions, material thickness, and internal structure of ribs must vary along the span to efficiently carry these varying loads and fulfill specific local requirements. (Refer to RAG Chunks 1 & 2, 'Key Insights/Traps' which mentions non-uniform distribution and closer spacing at wing root/concentrated load points).\n\n*   **Statement B: Ribs increase the column buckling stress of longitudinal stiffeners connected to them.** This statement is TRUE. Ribs act as intermediate supports for longitudinal stiffeners (also known as stringers). By providing these supports, ribs reduce the unsupported or 'effective' length of the stiffeners. According to Euler's critical buckling load formula, $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(KL)^2}$, reducing the effective length ($KL$) significantly increases the critical buckling load, and thus the buckling stress, that a stiffener can withstand. (Explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n\n*   **Statement C: Ribs increase plate buckling stress of the skin panels.** This statement is TRUE. Ribs, in conjunction with longitudinal stiffeners, subdivide the larger wing skin panels into smaller, more stable units. Smaller plate panels have a higher critical buckling stress compared to larger unsupported panels. This subdivision effectively increases the overall plate buckling resistance of the wing skin. (Explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, and 4).\n\n*   **Statement D: Ribs help in maintaining aerodynamic shape of the wing.** This statement is TRUE. One of the fundamental functions of ribs is to define and maintain the precise airfoil contour of the wing. This accurate shape is crucial for achieving the desired aerodynamic performance, including efficient lift generation and minimized drag. (Explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, and 6)."

          "**Step 1: Understand the role of ribs in semi-monocoque construction.** Recall that ribs are transverse structural members in a wing, perpendicular to spars, and are part of a system (skin, spars, stiffeners, ribs) that collectively carries loads.",
          "**Step 2: Evaluate Option A regarding rib dimensions.** Consider if rib dimensions would be constant along the wing span. Recognize that loads (bending, shear, torsion) and local requirements (e.g., engine mounts, landing gear bays, fuel tanks) vary significantly along the span, even for a rectangular planform. Therefore, rib dimensions must vary, making statement A false.",
          "**Step 3: Evaluate Option B regarding column buckling of stiffeners.** Remember that ribs provide intermediate support to longitudinal stiffeners. This support reduces the effective length of the stiffeners, which, according to column buckling theory (Euler's formula), increases their critical buckling load and stress. Thus, statement B is true.",
          "**Step 4: Evaluate Option C regarding plate buckling of skin panels.** Understand that ribs, along with stiffeners, break down large skin panels into smaller ones. Smaller panels have a higher critical plate buckling stress. Therefore, ribs enhance the buckling resistance of the skin, making statement C true.",
          "**Step 5: Evaluate Option D regarding maintaining aerodynamic shape.** Recall that a primary function of ribs is to define and maintain the precise airfoil contour of the wing, which is essential for aerodynamic efficiency. Thus, statement D is true.",
          "**Step 6: Conclude the correct statements.** Based on the analysis, statements B, C, and D are true."
