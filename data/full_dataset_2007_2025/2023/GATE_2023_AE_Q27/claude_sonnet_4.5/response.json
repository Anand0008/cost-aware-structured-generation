Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge chunks, the following statements are true:\n\nB. Ribs increase the column buckling stress of longitudinal stiffeners connected to them by reducing the effective length of the stiffeners.\n\nC. Ribs increase the plate buckling stress of the skin panels by subdividing large skin panels into smaller, more stable units.\n\nD. Ribs help in maintaining the aerodynamic shape of the wing by defining and maintaining the precise airfoil contour.\n\nStatement A is false, as the dimensions of the ribs do depend on their spanwise position in the wing, with ribs being more closely spaced at the wing root and around concentrated load points."
