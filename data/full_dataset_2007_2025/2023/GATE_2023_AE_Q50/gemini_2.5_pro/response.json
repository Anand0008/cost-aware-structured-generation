        "reasoning": "The problem involves a statically indeterminate beam, which is a cantilever with an additional roller support. The superposition method is the most suitable approach to solve this. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Redundancy:** The beam has a fixed end (A) and a roller support (B) in the middle. A fixed end provides three reactions (vertical force, horizontal force, and moment), and a roller support provides one vertical reaction. Thus, there are 4 unknown reactions. Since only 3 equilibrium equations are available (sum of forces in x and y directions, and sum of moments), the beam is statically indeterminate to the first degree (4 - 3 = 1).\n\n2.  **Choose Redundant Reaction:** Let the upward reaction at the roller support (point B, at distance 'a' from the fixed end) be `R_B`.\n\n3.  **Deflection due to external load F (Primary Beam):** Consider the beam as a simple cantilever of total length `L = 2a` with a downward force `F` at the free end (point C). We need to find the downward deflection at the location of the roller support (point B, at `x = a` from the fixed end).\n    The general formula for deflection `$\\Delta$` at a distance `x` from the fixed end of a cantilever beam of length `L` with a point load `P` at the free end is:\n    `$$\\Delta = \\frac{Px^2}{6EI}(3L - x)$$`\n    Substituting `P = F`, `L = 2a`, and `x = a`:\n    `$$\\Delta_{B1} = \\frac{F(a)^2}{6EI}(3(2a) - a) = \\frac{Fa^2}{6EI}(6a - a) = \\frac{5Fa^3}{6EI}$$`\n    This deflection `$\\Delta_{B1}$` is downward.\n\n4.  **Deflection due to redundant reaction R_B (Primary Beam):** Now, consider the beam as a simple cantilever of length `a` (from A to B) with an upward force `R_B` applied at its free end (point B). We need to find the upward deflection at point B due to `R_B`.\n    The formula for deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam of length `L_B` with a point load `P_B` at the free end is:\n    `$$\\Delta = \\frac{P_B L_B^3}{3EI}$$`\n    Substituting `P_B = R_B` and `L_B = a`:\n    `$$\\Delta_{B2} = \\frac{R_B a^3}{3EI}$$`\n    This deflection `$\\Delta_{B2}$` is upward.\n\n5.  **Compatibility Equation:** The roller support prevents vertical deflection at point B. Therefore, the net deflection at B must be zero.\n    `$$\\Delta_{B1} - \\Delta_{B2} = 0$$` (assuming downward `$\\Delta_{B1}$` is positive and upward `$\\Delta_{B2}$` is positive, so they subtract)\n    `$$\\frac{5Fa^3}{6EI} - \\frac{R_B a^3}{3EI} = 0$$`\n    Multiplying by `$\\frac{6EI}{a^3}$` (assuming `EI` and `a` are non-zero):\n    `$$5F - 2R_B = 0$$`\n    `$$R_B = \\frac{5F}{2}$$`\n\n6.  **Equilibrium of the entire beam:** Now that `R_B` is known, we can treat the beam as statically determinate with known loads: `F` (downward at `2a` from A) and `R_B = 5F/2` (upward at `a` from A). We need to find the moment reaction `M_A` at the fixed end A.\n    Sum of moments about the fixed end A, taking counter-clockwise moments as positive:\n    `$$\\Sigma M_A = 0$$`\n    `$$M_A - F(2a) + R_B(a) = 0$$`\n    Substitute `R_B = 5F/2`:\n    `$$M_A - F(2a) + \\left(\\frac{5F}{2}\\right)(a) = 0$$`\n    `$$M_A - 2Fa + 2.5Fa = 0$$`\n    `$$M_A + 0.5Fa = 0$$`\n    `$$M_A = -0.5Fa$$`\n    The negative sign indicates that the moment reaction `M_A` is clockwise. The question asks for the *magnitude* of the moment reaction.\n    Magnitude of `M_A = 0.5Fa`.\n\n7.  **Determine α:** The magnitude of the moment reaction is given as `$\\alpha Fa$`. Comparing this with our result:\n    `$$\\alpha Fa = 0.5Fa$$`\n    `$$\\alpha = 0.5$$`\n    Rounding to one decimal place, `$\\alpha = 0.5$`."

However, it did not contain specific examples or derivations for a cantilever beam with an *intermediate roller support* under a point load, which requires the superposition method for indeterminate structures. Therefore, the core solution method relied on internal knowledge, supplemented by the RAG for foundational concepts."
