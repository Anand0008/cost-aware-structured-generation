The cantilever beam is supported at the middle by a roller with a pin, which means the beam is statically determinate.\n2. The force F is applied at the tip (free end) of the beam.\n3. To find the moment reaction at the built-in end, we can use the principle of equilibrium. \n4. Taking moments about the built-in end (point A), we have:\n   M_A - F * 2a = 0\n   M_A = F * 2a\n5. The question states that the magnitude of the moment reaction is αFa, where α is the unknown value.\n6. Comparing the expressions, we can see that α = 0.5, as the moment reaction is half the product of the force F and the beam length 2a."
