Given the ratio of inner to outer diameter $k = D_i / D_o = 0.5$. The thickness is $t = R_o - R_i$.\n\n1.  **Exact Maximum Shear Stress ($\\tau$):**\n    The exact maximum shear stress in a hollow circular shaft under torsion is given by the formula (from RAG Chunks 1 & 2):\n    $\\tau = \\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - k^4)}$\n    Substituting $k = 0.5$:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - (0.5)^4)} = \\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - 0.0625)} = \\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (0.9375)}$\n\n2.  **Thin-Wall Approximation Shear Stress ($\\tau_{thin-wall}$):**\n    The thin-wall approximation (Bredt's formula) for shear stress is:\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 A_m t}$\n    Where:\n    *   $A_m$ is the mean enclosed area.\n    *   $t$ is the wall thickness.\n\n    First, express $A_m$ and $t$ in terms of $D_o$ and $k$:\n    *   Outer radius $R_o = D_o / 2$\n    *   Inner radius $R_i = k R_o = 0.5 R_o$\n    *   Thickness $t = R_o - R_i = R_o - 0.5 R_o = 0.5 R_o = 0.5 (D_o / 2) = D_o / 4$\n    *   Mean radius $r_m = \\frac{R_o + R_i}{2} = \\frac{R_o + 0.5 R_o}{2} = \\frac{1.5 R_o}{2} = 0.75 R_o = 0.75 (D_o / 2) = 0.375 D_o$\n    *   Mean enclosed area $A_m = \\pi r_m^2 = \\pi (0.375 D_o)^2 = \\pi (0.140625 D_o^2)$\n\n    Substitute these into the thin-wall formula:\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi (0.140625 D_o^2) (D_o / 4)} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi (0.140625 D_o^2) (0.25 D_o)}$\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi (0.03515625 D_o^3)} = \\frac{T}{0.0703125 \\pi D_o^3}$\n\n    Alternatively, using the general form in terms of $k$:\n    $t = R_o(1-k)$\n    $r_m = R_o(1+k)/2$\n    $A_m = \\pi r_m^2 = \\pi R_o^2 (1+k)^2 / 4$\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 \\left[\\pi R_o^2 \\frac{(1+k)^2}{4}\\right] [R_o(1-k)]} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi R_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}$\n    Since $R_o = D_o/2$, $R_o^3 = D_o^3/8$. So,\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi (D_o^3/8) (1+k)^2 (1-k)} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Stresses ($\\tau / \\tau_{thin-wall}$):**\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{\\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - k^4)}}{\\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}}$\n    Cancel common terms ($16 T / (\\pi D_o^3)$):\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{(1+k)^2 (1-k)}{(1 - k^4)}$\n    Using the identity $1 - k^4 = (1 - k^2)(1 + k^2) = (1 - k)(1 + k)(1 + k^2)$:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{(1+k)^2 (1-k)}{(1 - k)(1 + k)(1 + k^2)}$\n    Cancel $(1-k)$ and one $(1+k)$ term:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{1+k}{1+k^2}$\n\n    Substitute $k = 0.5$:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{1 + 0.5}{1 + (0.5)^2} = \\frac{1.5}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{1.5}{1.25} = 1.2$\n\n    The calculated ratio is 1.2, which falls within the specified range of 1.1 to 1.3."
