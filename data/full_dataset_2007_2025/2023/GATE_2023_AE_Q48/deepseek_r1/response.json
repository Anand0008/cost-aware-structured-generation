For circular tube, median radius r_m = (r_o + r_i)/2 = r_o (1+k)/2. Thus A_m = π r_m^2 = π r_o^2 (1+k)^2 / 4. Thickness t = r_o - r_i = r_o (1-k). So τ_thin-wall = T / (2 * [π r_o^2 (1+k)^2/4] * [r_o (1-k)]) = (2 T) / (π r_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)). Since r_o = D_o/2, τ_thin-wall = (16 T) / (π D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)).",

However, RAG did not contain any information about thin-wall approximation formula (τ = T/(2 A_m t)), which is critical for this problem. Therefore, internal knowledge was used for thin-wall part. Overall, RAG was helpful for exact stress but incomplete for the full problem."

For the shaft reacting to an applied torque, the ratio of the maximum shear stress τ to the maximum shear stress τ_thin-wall obtained using the thin-wall approximation is _______.
