        "reasoning": "Let outer radius be R and inner radius be r. Given inner diameter to outer diameter ratio is 0.5, so r/R = 0.25. Thickness t = R - r = 0.75R. Exact maximum shear stress for a hollow circular shaft under torque T is given by $\\tau_{\\max} = \\dfrac{T R}{J}$ with $J = \\dfrac{\\pi}{2}(R^4 - r^4)$. Thin-wall approximation for a circular tube gives $\\tau_{\\text{thin}} = \\dfrac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 t}$. Substituting $t = 0.75R$ and simplifying the ratio $\\dfrac{\\tau_{\\max}}{\\tau_{\\text{thin}}}$ yields $\\dfrac{3}{2}(1 - (r/R)^4) = \\dfrac{3}{2}(1 - 0.25^4) = \\dfrac{3}{2} \\times 0.99609375 \\approx 1.49414$. However, this is inconsistent with standard torsion theory and indicates a mis-setup of the thin-wall expression. The correct thin-wall shear stress for a circular tube of mean radius $R_m$ and thickness $t$ is $\\tau_{\\text{thin}} = \\dfrac{T}{2 \\pi R_m^2 t}$ only if using polar moment approximation $J \\approx 2 \\pi R_m^3 t$; but the more common thin-wall torsion formula is $T = 2 A_m t \\tau$ where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line, giving $\\tau_{\\text{thin}} = \\dfrac{T}{2 A_m t} = \\dfrac{T}{2 \\pi R_m^2 t}$. For a relatively thick tube (r/R = 0.25), the mean radius is $R_m = (R + r)/2 = 0.625R$. Using this correct $R_m$ and re-evaluating the ratio gives $\\tau_{\\max}/\\tau_{\\text{thin}} \\approx 1.2$, which lies within the official key range 1.1 to 1.3. Therefore, the official numerical band is consistent with refined thin-wall modeling and is accepted as correct."
