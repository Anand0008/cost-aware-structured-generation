First, the mass flow rate of oxygen is determined from the given mixture ratio. Then, both hydrogen and oxygen mass flow rates are converted to molar flow rates using their respective molar masses. By comparing the actual molar ratio to the stoichiometric molar ratio from the balanced chemical equation, it's confirmed that the combustion is perfectly stoichiometric. Finally, the molar flow rate of water is calculated based on the stoichiometric coefficients and the molar flow rates of the reactants."

    "question_text": "Consider a cryogenic liquid rocket engine using an expander cycle with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as the two propellants. The mass flow rate of hydrogen ṁ_{H2} into the combustion chamber is 32 kg/s, and the mass flow rate of oxygen ṁ_{O2} into the chamber is such that ṁ_{O2} / ṁ_{H2} = 8. The combustion of hydrogen and oxygen is at stoichiometry. Assuming that the rate of the forward reaction is much larger than that of the reverse reaction, the rate of formation of H₂O is ________ kmol/s. (round off to the nearest integer)"
