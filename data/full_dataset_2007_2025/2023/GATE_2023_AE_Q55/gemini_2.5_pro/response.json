        "reasoning": "The problem defines the power coefficient `C_p = P / (ρ ω³ D⁵)` and states its relationship with the flow coefficient `Φ` as `C_p = a Φ²`. It also describes `Φ` as a dimensionless volume flow rate scaled with `ω` and `D`, which implies `Φ = Q / (ω D³)`. By substituting the definition of `Φ` into the `C_p` relationship and then solving for `P`, we get `P = a Q² ρ ω / D`. When the rotation rate `ω` is increased to `1.25ω` while the flow rate `Q` and length scale `D` (and fluid density `ρ`) remain constant, the new power `P'` becomes `P' = a Q² ρ (1.25ω) / D = 1.25 (a Q² ρ ω / D) = 1.25 P`. Thus, `α = 1.25`."

          "Step 1: Identify the given relationships for the power coefficient `C_p` and flow coefficient `Φ`. We are given `C_p = P / (ρ ω³ D⁵)` and `C_p = a Φ²`. The flow coefficient `Φ` is defined as a dimensionless volume flow rate scaled with `ω` and `D`, which implies `Φ = Q / (ω D³)`. Here, `P` is power, `ρ` is fluid density, `ω` is rotation rate, `D` is a length scale, `Q` is volume flow rate, and `a` is a constant.",
          "Step 2: Equate the two expressions for `C_p` and substitute the definition of `Φ` into the equation: `P / (ρ ω³ D⁵) = a (Q / (ω D³))²`.",
          "Step 3: Simplify the right-hand side of the equation: `P / (ρ ω³ D⁵) = a Q² / (ω² D⁶)`.",
          "Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for power `P`: `P = a Q² (ρ ω³ D⁵) / (ω² D⁶)`. This simplifies to `P = a Q² ρ ω / D`.",
          "Step 5: Define the initial and final states. Let the initial power be `P_1` at rotation rate `ω_1 = ω`. The new rotation rate is `ω_2 = 1.25ω_1`. The problem states that the flow rate `Q` remains the same, so `Q_2 = Q_1`. The fluid density `ρ` and length scale `D` are assumed to be constant as they are not mentioned to change.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the new power `P_2` using the derived formula from Step 4 and the new conditions: `P_2 = a Q_2² ρ ω_2 / D = a Q_1² ρ (1.25 ω_1) / D`. This can be written as `P_2 = 1.25 * (a Q_1² ρ ω_1 / D)`.",
          "Step 7: Compare `P_2` with `P_1`. Since `P_1 = a Q_1² ρ ω_1 / D`, we have `P_2 = 1.25 P_1`. The problem states that the new power changes to `αP`, so `P_2 = αP_1`. Therefore, `α = 1.25`."
