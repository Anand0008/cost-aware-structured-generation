However, here $Q$ is constant, so $\\Phi \\propto 1/\\omega$. Substituting into the given relation $C_p = a \\Phi^2$, we find $P \\propto \\omega$.

    "question_text": "The operating characteristics of a pump were measured to be C_p = a Φ², where power coefficient C_p = P / (ρ ω³ D⁵), Φ is the flow coefficient, a is a constant, D is a length scale, ω is the rotation rate, ρ is fluid density, and P is the power required. The flow coefficient is a dimensionless volume flow rate scaled with ω and D. Assuming that the flow rate remains the same, if the rotation rate is increased to 1.25ω, the power changes to αP. The value of α is ________ . (round off to two decimal places)"
