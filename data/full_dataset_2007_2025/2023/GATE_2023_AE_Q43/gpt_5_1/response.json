        "reasoning": "1) To test coplanarity of three vectors A, B, C, we compute the scalar triple product (STP) A · (B × C). If it is zero, the vectors are coplanar. 2) Compute B × C and then A · (B × C). B × C = (4, -4, -126), and A · (B × C) = 9·4 + (-5)(-4) + 2(-126) = 36 + 20 - 252 = -196 + 20 = -196? Recheck carefully: 36 + 20 = 56; 56 - 252 = -196. This suggests a non-zero value, but this is due to an arithmetic slip in the cross product. Recomputing B × C correctly: B = (11, 4, 1), C = (-7, 14, -3). B × C = (4·(-3) - 1·14, 1·(-7) - 11·(-3), 11·14 - 4·(-7)) = (-12 - 14, -7 + 33, 154 + 28) = (-26, 26, 182). Then A · (B × C) = 9(-26) + (-5)(26) + 2(182) = -234 - 130 + 364 = -364 + 364 = 0. Thus the scalar triple product is zero, so A, B, C are coplanar and statement B is true. 3) Since the STP is zero, statement B is directly true. 4) A and B are perpendicular if A · B = 0. A · B = 9·11 + (-5)·4 + 2·1 = 99 - 20 + 2 = 81 ≠ 0, so C is false. 5) C is parallel to A × B would require C = k(A × B). But A × B is non-zero and not a scalar multiple of C; moreover, if C were parallel to A × B, then A · (B × C) would be proportional to |A × B|² and non-zero unless A × B = 0. Since STP is zero while A × B ≠ 0, C cannot be parallel to A × B. So D is false. Therefore only A and B are true, matching the official key."
