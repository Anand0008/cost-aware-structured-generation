Vectors A and B are not perpendicular:\n   - The dot product of A and B is non-zero, `A . B = 9*11 + (-5)*4 + 2*1 = 84 != 0`.\n   - This means A and B are not perpendicular, invalidating statement C.\n\n4. Vector C is not parallel to A x B:\n   - The cross product of A and B is `A x B = (9*1 - (-5)*11, 9*4 + 5*1, -5*1 - 2*11) = (104, 41, -22)`.\n   - The vector C = (-7, 14, -3) is not parallel to A x B, invalidating statement D.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and B."
