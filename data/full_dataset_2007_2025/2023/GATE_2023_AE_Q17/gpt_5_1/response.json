        "reasoning": "For a glider, maximum range corresponds to maximum lift-to-drag ratio, i.e., maximizing $L/D = C_L/C_D$. With drag polar $C_D = C_{D_0} + C_{D_i}$ and $C_{D_i} = K C_L^2$, we can write $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$. Maximizing $C_L/C_D$ with respect to $C_L$ (or equivalently with respect to $C_D$ via $C_D(C_L)$) is a standard result: at $(L/D)_{\\max}$, parasite drag equals induced drag, i.e., $C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}$. This is explicitly given in Anderson: $C_{D,0} = C_{D,i}$ at maximum $L/D$. Therefore the required ratio $C_{D_0}/C_{D_i} = 1$, which corresponds to option A."
