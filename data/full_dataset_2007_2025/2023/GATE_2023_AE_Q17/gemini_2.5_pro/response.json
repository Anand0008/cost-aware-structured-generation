The total drag coefficient is given by $C_D = C_{D_0} + C_{D_i}$, where $C_{D_i} = K C_L^2$. Thus, the total drag coefficient can be written as $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$. The lift-to-drag ratio is $L/D = C_L / C_D = C_L / (C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)$. To find the maximum $L/D$, we differentiate this expression with respect to $C_L$ and set the derivative to zero.\\n\\n$$\\frac{d}{dC_L} \\left( \\frac{C_L}{C_{D_0} + K C_L^2} \\right) = 0$$ \\nUsing the quotient rule, $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u = C_L$ and $v = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$. \\n\\nSetting the numerator of the derivative to zero:\\n$$(C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)(1) - C_L(2 K C_L) = 0$$ \\n$$C_{D_0} + K C_L^2 - 2 K C_L^2 = 0$$ \\n$$C_{D_0} - K C_L^2 = 0$$ \\n$$C_{D_0} = K C_L^2$$ \\nSince $C_{D_i} = K C_L^2$ is the induced drag coefficient, the condition for maximum $L/D$ (and thus maximum range for a glider) is $C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}$. Therefore, the ratio $C_{D_0} / C_{D_i} = 1$. This is a fundamental result in aircraft performance, confirmed by multiple RAG sources."

          "Step 2: Write down the given drag characteristics. The total drag coefficient is $C_D = C_{D_0} + C_{D_i}$, and the induced drag coefficient is given as $C_{D_i} = K C_L^2$. Substitute the expression for $C_{D_i}$ into the total drag equation: $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$.",
          "Step 3: Formulate the expression for the lift-to-drag ratio. $L/D = C_L / C_D$. Substitute the expression for $C_D$: $L/D = C_L / (C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)$.",
          "Step 4: To find the maximum value of $L/D$, differentiate the expression for $L/D$ with respect to $C_L$ and set the derivative to zero. This is a standard optimization technique from calculus.",
          "Step 5: Apply the quotient rule for differentiation: $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$. Here, $u = C_L$ (so $u' = 1$) and $v = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$ (so $v' = 2 K C_L$).",
          "Step 6: Set the numerator of the derivative to zero: $(C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)(1) - C_L(2 K C_L) = 0$.",
          "Step 7: Simplify the equation: $C_{D_0} + K C_L^2 - 2 K C_L^2 = 0 \\implies C_{D_0} - K C_L^2 = 0 \\implies C_{D_0} = K C_L^2$.",
          "Step 8: Recognize that $K C_L^2$ is the induced drag coefficient $C_{D_i}$. Therefore, the condition for maximum $L/D$ is $C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}$.",
