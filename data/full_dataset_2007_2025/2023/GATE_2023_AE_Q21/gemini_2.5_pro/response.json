        "reasoning": "The question defines a '50% reaction ideal axial flow compressor' and asks for the correct statement. The definition of the degree of reaction (R) is the ratio of the static enthalpy rise in the rotor to the static enthalpy rise in the entire stage. Mathematically, this is given by: \\n\\n$R = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$ \\n\\nwhere: \\n*   $h_1$ is the static enthalpy at the rotor inlet. \\n*   $h_2$ is the static enthalpy at the rotor outlet. \\n*   $h_3$ is the static enthalpy at the stage outlet (stator outlet). \\n\\nFor a 50% reaction stage, $R = 0.5$. Substituting this into the definition: \\n\\n$0.5 = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$ \\n\\nRearranging this equation, we get: \\n\\n$h_2 - h_1 = 0.5 \\times (h_3 - h_1)$ \\n\\nThis means the static enthalpy rise across the rotor ($h_2 - h_1$) is 50% of the static enthalpy rise across the entire stage ($h_3 - h_1$). This directly matches option B. \\n\\nLet's analyze other options: \\n*   **A. The stagnation enthalpy rise across the rotor is 50% of the rise across the stage.** In an ideal axial flow compressor, work is done only in the rotor. Therefore, the stagnation enthalpy rise across the rotor is equal to the stagnation enthalpy rise across the entire stage. So, this statement is incorrect. \\n*   **C. Axial velocity component of the flow at the rotor exit is 50% of that at the rotor entry.** For an ideal axial flow compressor, the axial velocity component is typically assumed to remain constant throughout the stage for simplicity in analysis, or at least not necessarily change by 50% due to 50% reaction. This statement is incorrect. \\n*   **D. The static pressure rise across the rotor is 50% of the rise across the stator.** For a 50% reaction stage, the static enthalpy rise across the rotor is *equal* to the static enthalpy rise across the stator (as the total static enthalpy rise of the stage is split equally between rotor and stator). Since static pressure rise is directly related to static enthalpy rise for an ideal gas, the static pressure rise across the rotor would be approximately equal to the static pressure rise across the stator, not 50% of it. So, this statement is incorrect."

          "Step 1: Understand the definition of 'Degree of Reaction' (R) in an axial flow compressor. The degree of reaction is a non-dimensional parameter that indicates the proportion of static enthalpy (or pressure) rise occurring in the rotor relative to the total static enthalpy (or pressure) rise in the entire stage.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for the Degree of Reaction. It is defined as $R = \\frac{\\Delta h_{static, rotor}}{\\Delta h_{static, stage}}$, where $\\Delta h_{static, rotor} = h_2 - h_1$ (static enthalpy rise across the rotor) and $\\Delta h_{static, stage} = h_3 - h_1$ (static enthalpy rise across the entire stage).",
          "Step 3: Apply the given condition for the question, which states that the compressor has a '50% reaction'. This means $R = 0.5$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute $R = 0.5$ into the definition of the degree of reaction: $0.5 = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to express the static enthalpy rise across the rotor in terms of the static enthalpy rise across the stage: $h_2 - h_1 = 0.5 \\times (h_3 - h_1)$. This implies that the static enthalpy rise across the rotor is 50% of the static enthalpy rise across the stage.",
