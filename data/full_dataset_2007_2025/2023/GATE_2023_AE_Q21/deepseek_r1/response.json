        "reasoning": "The question is a direct test of the definition of the degree of reaction (R). By definition, for a 50% reaction stage, the static enthalpy rise in the rotor is exactly half of the total static enthalpy rise of the entire stage. This is stated explicitly in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2). Option A is incorrect because the stagnation enthalpy rise across the stage occurs entirely in the rotor (stator is adiabatic, no work done). Option C is incorrect; axial velocity is typically constant in a preliminary design analysis. Option D is a distractor; the degree of reaction is defined in terms of static enthalpy, not static pressure directly, and for an incompressible flow, it would imply static pressure, but the question specifies 'ideal axial flow compressor,' which is typically analyzed with compressible flow. Only option B matches the fundamental definition of R=0.5."
