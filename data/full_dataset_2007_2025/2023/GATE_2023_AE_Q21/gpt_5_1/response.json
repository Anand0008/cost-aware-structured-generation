Mathematically, \\(R = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}\\), where \\(h_1\\) is static enthalpy at rotor inlet, \\(h_2\\) at rotor exit, and \\(h_3\\) at stator exit. For a 50% reaction stage, \\(R = 0.5\\), so the static enthalpy rise in the rotor is exactly half of the total static enthalpy rise across the stage. Therefore, statement B is the correct one. Option A is wrong because reaction is defined using static enthalpy, not stagnation enthalpy. Option C is unrelated: 50% reaction does not imply the axial velocity halves; in ideal repeating stages, axial velocity is usually taken as constant. Option D is incorrect because it compares rotor static pressure rise to stator static pressure rise; 50% reaction means rotor static rise is 50% of the stage rise, not 50% of the stator rise."
