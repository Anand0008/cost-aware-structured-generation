        "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement A: The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix equals the sum of the elements of the principal diagonal.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The sum of the eigenvalues of a square matrix is equal to its trace. The trace of a square matrix is defined as the sum of the elements on its main (principal) diagonal. This is a fundamental property of eigenvalues and matrices, often used in linear algebra. (Supported by general linear algebra principles, implicitly by RAG Chunk 1 mentioning 'Properties of Eigenvalues').\n\n**Statement B: If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then $1/\\lambda$ is always an eigenvalue of its transpose (A^T).**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. RAG Chunk 1 explicitly states: \"A square matrix `A` and its transpose `A^T` have the exact same eigenvalues.\" This means if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A, then $\\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of A^T. It does not mean $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A^T. For example, if $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$, its eigenvalues are $2$ and $3$. Then $A^T = A$, and its eigenvalues are also $2$ and $3$. However, $1/2$ and $1/3$ are not eigenvalues of $A^T$. The property that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A, then $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ (if A is invertible) is distinct from this statement.\n\n**Statement C: If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an orthogonal matrix A, then $1/\\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of A.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. An orthogonal matrix A is a square matrix such that $A A^T = A^T A = I$, which implies $A^{-1} = A^T$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A, then $A x = \\lambda x$ for some non-zero eigenvector $x$. A known property is that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A, then $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ (provided A is invertible, which orthogonal matrices always are). Since $A^{-1} = A^T$, it means $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T$. Furthermore, RAG Chunk 1 confirms that a matrix A and its transpose $A^T$ have the exact same eigenvalues. Therefore, if $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T$, it must also be an eigenvalue of A. (Supported by RAG Chunk 1 and general properties of orthogonal matrices).\n\n**Statement D: If a matrix has n distinct eigenvalues, it also has n independent eigenvectors.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. RAG Chunk 6 (Diagonalization) explicitly states: \"If an `n x n` matrix `A` has `n` distinct eigenvalues, then `A` is diagonalizable.\" A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has `n` linearly independent eigenvectors. Therefore, having `n` distinct eigenvalues guarantees `n` linearly independent eigenvectors. (Directly supported by RAG Chunk 6)."

          "Step 3: Evaluate Statement B: Recall the relationship between eigenvalues of a matrix A and its transpose A^T. As per RAG Chunk 1, A and A^T have the same eigenvalues. Then, consider the relationship between eigenvalues of A and $A^{-1}$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A, $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$. The statement incorrectly combines these, implying $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T$. Provide a counterexample if necessary to confirm it's false.",

Finally, use the property that A and $A^T$ have the same eigenvalues (RAG Chunk 1) to conclude that $1/\\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of A. Confirm this statement as true.",

Chunk 6 provided the condition for distinct eigenvalues implying independent eigenvectors for option D. Chunk 2 and 3 reinforced the properties of symmetric matrices and their diagonalization, which are related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The RAG context was very helpful in validating the statements."
