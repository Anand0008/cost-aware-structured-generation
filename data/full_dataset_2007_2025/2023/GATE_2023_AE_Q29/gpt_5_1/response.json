If \\(A x = \\lambda x\\), then multiplying by \\(A^{-1}\\) gives \\(x = \\lambda A^{-1} x\\) so \\(A^{-1} x = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} x\\). Since the eigenvalues of \\(A^{-1}\\) are reciprocals of those of \\(A\\), and \\(A^{-1} = A^T\\) is similar to \\(A\\), the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) come in reciprocal pairs: if \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue, so is \\(1/\\lambda\\).
