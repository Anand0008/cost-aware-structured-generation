In categorical logic, the negation of a particular negative statement ('Some S are not P') is a universal affirmative statement ('All S are P').\n\n1.  **Given Statement:** 'Some human beings are not cruel creatures' is FALSE.\n2.  **Logical Inference (Negation):** If 'Some human beings are not cruel creatures' is FALSE, then its contradictory opposite must be TRUE. The contradictory opposite is 'All human beings are cruel creatures'. Thus, statement (i) is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on the certainty that 'All human beings are cruel creatures' is TRUE:\n\n*   **(i) All human beings are cruel creatures.** As derived above, this is TRUE with certainty.\n\n*   **(ii) Some human beings are cruel creatures.** If 'All human beings are cruel creatures' is TRUE, it logically implies that 'Some human beings are cruel creatures' is also TRUE (by subalternation in the Square of Opposition). If every single human being is cruel, then it must be true that at least one (and therefore some) human beings are cruel. Thus, statement (ii) is TRUE with certainty.\n\n*   **(iii) Some creatures that are cruel are human beings.** If 'All human beings are cruel creatures' is TRUE, it means the set of human beings is a subset of the set of cruel creatures. This implies that the intersection of 'cruel creatures' and 'human beings' is non-empty (it contains all human beings). Therefore, if there are human beings, then some cruel creatures must be human beings. This is also a valid inference. Thus, statement (iii) is TRUE with certainty.\n\n*   **(iv) No human beings are cruel creatures.** If 'All human beings are cruel creatures' is TRUE, then 'No human beings are cruel creatures' must be FALSE (these are contrary statements and cannot both be true). Therefore, statement (iv) cannot be inferred with certainty as TRUE; in fact, it is certainly FALSE.\n\nSince (i), (ii), and (iii) are logically inferred with certainty, option D is the correct answer."
