          "name": "Impulse-based reasoning",
          "description": "Instead of directly using the rocket equation, reason that the change in momentum equals the integral of thrust over time. With constant \\(I_{sp}\\), thrust is proportional to mass flow rate, and total impulse depends on total propellant mass. Then connect total impulse to delta-v via average mass, leading back to a dependence on mass ratio.",
