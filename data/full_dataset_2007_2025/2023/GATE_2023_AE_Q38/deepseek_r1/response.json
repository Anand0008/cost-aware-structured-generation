Given identical specific impulse $I_{sp}$ and initial mass $m_0 = 5600$ kg for both missiles, the ratio $V_A/V_B$ depends only on the mass ratios. For missile A: propellant mass $m_{pA} = \\dot{m}_A t_A = 120 \\times 30 = 3600$ kg, so final mass $m_{fA} = 5600 - 3600 = 2000$ kg, mass ratio $m_0/m_{fA} = 5600/2000 = 2.8$. For missile B: $m_{pB} = 70 \\times 70 = 4900$ kg, $m_{fB} = 5600 - 4900 = 700$ kg, mass ratio $m_0/m_{fB} = 5600/700 = 8$.
