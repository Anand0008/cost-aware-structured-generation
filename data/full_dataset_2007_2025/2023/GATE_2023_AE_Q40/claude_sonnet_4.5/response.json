Solve for the velocity (V) that minimizes T_R, which is the maximum cruise speed.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n- Weight (W) = 10 kN = 10,000 N\n- Wing area (S) = 15 m^2 \n- Air density (ρ) = 0.6 kg/m^3\n- C_D0 = 0.025, K = 0.05\n\nSolving the steps, we get:\nC_L = 2 * 10,000 / (0.6 * V^2 * 15) = 0.222 / V^2\nC_D = 0.025 + 0.05 * (0.222 / V^2)^2\nT_R = 10,000 / (0.222 / V^2 / (0.025 + 0.05 * (0.222 / V^2)^2))\nMinimizing T_R with respect to V gives the maximum cruise speed of approximately 87 m/s."
