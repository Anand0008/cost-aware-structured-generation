We are given a drag polar \\(C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2\\), aircraft weight, wing area, air density, and maximum available thrust (1 kN). For a given speed, lift coefficient is \\(C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}\\). Substituting this into the drag polar and then into the drag equation \\(D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D\\) gives drag as a function of speed. Setting \\(D = T_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\text{N}\\) and solving for \\(V\\) yields the maximum cruise speed. \n\nGiven: \\(W = 10\\,\\text{kN} = 10000\\,\\text{N}\\), \\(S = 15\\,\\text{m}^2\\), \\(\\rho = 0.60\\,\\text{kg/m}^3\\), \\(C_{D_0} = 0.025\\), \\(K = 0.05\\), \\(T_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\text{N}\\).\n\n1) Express \\(C_L\\) in terms of \\(V\\):\n\\[ C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S} = \\frac{2 \\times 10000}{0.6 V^2 \\times 15} = \\frac{20000}{9 V^2} = \\frac{2222.22}{V^2}. \\]\n2) Then \\(C_L^2 = \\frac{(2222.22)^2}{V^4} \\approx \\frac{4.94 \\times 10^6}{V^4}.\\)\n3) Drag coefficient:\n\\[ C_D = 0.025 + 0.05 C_L^2 = 0.025 + 0.05 \\cdot \\frac{4.94 \\times 10^6}{V^4} = 0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}. \\]\n4) Drag:\n\\[ D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D = 0.5 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 15 \\cdot V^2 \\left(0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}\\right). \\]\nThe constant in front is \\(0.5 \\times 0.6 \\times 15 = 4.5\\), so\n\\[ D = 4.5 V^2 \\left(0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}\\right) = 4.5(0.025 V^2) + 4.5 \\cdot \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^2}. \\]\nCompute coefficients:\n\\(4.5 \\times 0.025 = 0.1125\\), and \\(4.5 \\times 2.47 \\times 10^5 \\approx 1.1115 \\times 10^6\\).
