        "reasoning": "Based on the fundamental equations for steady, level, unaccelerated flight ($L=W$ and $T=D$) and the given drag polar, the maximum cruise speed for the provided parameters (Weight = 10 kN, Wing Area = 15 m², $C_{D_0}$ = 0.025, $K$ = 0.05, $\\rho$ = 0.60 kg/m³, Thrust = 1 kN) is calculated to be approximately 296.25 m/s. This value does not match any of the given options, including the provided answer key A (87 m/s). If 87 m/s were a cruise speed, the required thrust would be approximately 231.94 N, and it would represent the *lower* of two possible cruise speeds for that thrust, not the maximum. The maximum cruise speed for 231.94 N thrust would be approximately 114.2 m/s. Therefore, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between the problem statement's parameters and the provided answer key. However, following the instruction that the answer key is correct by definition, option A is marked as correct."
