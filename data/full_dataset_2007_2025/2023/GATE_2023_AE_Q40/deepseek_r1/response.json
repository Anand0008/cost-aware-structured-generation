Using the condition L = W to find CL, substituting into the drag polar to get CD, and then using T = D = (1/2)*ρ*V^2*S*CD yields an equation with V. The equation is quadratic in V^2. Solving gives two positive roots for V, representing low-speed and high-speed level flight solutions. The maximum cruise speed is the higher root, which rounds to 87 m/s.

          "Step 1: Identify governing principles. For steady, level cruise flight, Lift (L) = Weight (W) and Thrust (T) = Drag (D). The drag coefficient is given by the drag polar: $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$.",
          "Step 2: Write the lift equation to find $C_L$ in terms of velocity ($V$). From $L=W$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L = W$. Therefore, $C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}$.",
          "Step 3: Write the drag force equation. $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$. Since $T = D$ and we are given thrust $T$, the equation becomes $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S (C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)$.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the expression for $C_L$ from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3. This gives $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S \\left[ C_{D_0} + K \\left( \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S} \\right)^2 \\right]$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute all known numerical values into the equation. $W = 10000\\,\\text{N}$, $S = 15\\,\\text{m}^2$, $C_{D_0} = 0.025$, $K = 0.05$, $\\rho = 0.60\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $T = 1000\\,\\text{N}$. The equation becomes: $1000 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.60) V^2 (15) \\left[ 0.025 + 0.05 \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 10000}{0.60 \\times V^2 \\times 15} \\right)^2 \\right]$.",
          "Step 6: Simplify the equation. This reduces to $1000 = 4.5 V^2 \\left[ 0.025 + \\frac{111111.11}{V^4} \\right]$, or $1000 = 0.1125 V^2 + \\frac{500000}{V^2}$.",
          "Step 7: Multiply through by $V^2$ and rearrange into a quadratic in $V^2$. Let $x = V^2$. The equation becomes $0.1125 x^2 - 1000 x + 500000 = 0$.",
          "Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation for $x$. The solutions are $x \\approx 1300.8$ and $x \\approx 7587.1$. Therefore, $V = \\sqrt{x} \\approx 36.1\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $V \\approx 87.1\\,\\text{m/s}$. The maximum cruise speed is the higher value, which rounds to 87 m/s."
