        "reasoning": "For a given freestream Mach number M and desired shock angle \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\), the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation uniquely determines the flow deflection angle \\(\\theta\\) (weak-shock branch) as long as \\(\\theta\\) is below the maximum deflection \\(\\theta_{\\max}(M)\\). In this intake, the cowl lip is fixed in space and the ramp rotates about the leading edge O. The line from O to the cowl lip fixes the desired shock angle \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) geometrically. When M changes, we can always adjust the ramp angle \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\) so that the flow deflection \\(\\theta\\) given by the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation equals the geometric angle between the ramp and the shock line. For realistic intake operating ranges, \\(\\theta\\) remains below \\(\\theta_{\\max}(M)\\), so a weak attached oblique shock with the same \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) can be maintained by changing \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\). Hence statement A is correct in the sense intended by the question. \n\nStatement B: For fixed \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\), as M increases, the weak-shock solution of the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation gives a *smaller* shock angle \\(\\beta\\) (shock becomes more slender), not larger. So B is false.\n\nStatement C: It claims that beyond some critical M, it is impossible to keep the same \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) by adjusting \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\). For a fixed \\(\\beta\\), the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation gives a monotonic \\(\\theta(M)\\) that stays below \\(\\theta_{\\max}(M)\\) for the usual intake range; oblique shocks exist for all supersonic M with appropriate \\(\\theta\\). Thus the statement as posed is false in standard oblique-shock theory.\n\nStatement D: For an oblique shock, the normal Mach number is \\(M_n = M \\sin\\beta\\). For the shock to exist, we require \\(M_n > 1\\), so \\(\\sin\\beta > 1/M\\), i.e. \\(\\beta > \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\). The option says \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}} < \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\), which contradicts this requirement, so D is false."

          "Step 1: Recall the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation: for a given upstream Mach number M and flow deflection angle \\(\\theta\\), the oblique shock angle \\(\\beta\\) is determined (weak and strong branches) as long as \\(\\theta < \\theta_{\\max}(M)\\).",
          "Step 2: Geometrically, the cowl lip position fixes the line along which the shock must lie if it is to hit the lip. Thus the desired shock angle \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) is fixed by geometry, independent of M.",
          "Step 3: When M changes, we can rotate the ramp (change \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\)) so that the flow deflection angle \\(\\theta\\) required by the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation for that M and the chosen \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) is achieved. Therefore, as long as an attached oblique shock solution exists, we can keep \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\) the same by adjusting \\(\\theta_{\\text{RAMP}}\\). This supports statement A.",
          "Step 4: For fixed \\(\\theta\\), examine how \\(\\beta\\) varies with M from the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) curve: as M increases, the weak-shock solution moves to smaller \\(\\beta\\) (shock becomes more inclined to the flow). Hence statement B, which says \\(\\beta\\) increases with M at fixed \\(\\theta\\), is false.",
          "Step 5: Consider statement C: it asserts a critical M beyond which no ramp setting can keep the same \\(\\beta_{\\text{SHOCK}}\\). But for any supersonic M, we can choose a \\(\\theta\\) (usually small enough) such that the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation is satisfied for the given \\(\\beta\\). Thus, within oblique-shock theory, such a critical M does not arise in the way described, so C is false.",
          "Step 6: For statement D, use the normal Mach number: \\(M_n = M \\sin\\beta\\). For a shock to exist, \\(M_n > 1\\Rightarrow \\sin\\beta > 1/M\\Rightarrow \\beta > \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\). Therefore the inequality in D is reversed, making D false."
