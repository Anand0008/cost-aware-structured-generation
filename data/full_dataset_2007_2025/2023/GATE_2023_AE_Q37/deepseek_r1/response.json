As M increases, θ_RAMP can be adjusted to maintain β = β_geom, since for any M > 1/sin(β), the required θ is always ≤ θ_max(M), the maximum deflection angle for that Mach number. Option B is false: for fixed θ, β decreases as M increases (shock becomes more oblique). Option C is false: there is no such critical M beyond which it's impossible; adjustment is always possible as long as M > 1/sin(β). Option D is false: for an attached oblique shock, β > μ, where μ = sin^{-1}(1/M) is the Mach angle."

          "Step 1: Understand the geometry. The cowl lip position is fixed relative to the leading edge O. For the oblique shock from O to hit the cowl lip, the shock angle β_SHOCK must equal a specific geometric angle β_geom (determined by the line from O to the cowl lip).",
          "Step 2: Recall the oblique shock θ-β-M relationship: $\\tan\\theta = 2 \\cot\\beta \\frac{M^2 \\sin^2\\beta - 1}{M^2 (\\gamma + \\cos 2\\beta) + 2}$, where θ is the flow deflection angle (θ_RAMP), M is upstream Mach number, and β is shock angle.",
          "Step 3: Analyze option A: For a given M, we need to find θ such that β = β_geom. Since β_geom is fixed, we can always compute θ from the θ-β-M relation, provided M > 1/sin(β_geom) (so that the normal Mach component M_n ≥ 1). As M increases, the required θ changes, but a solution always exists because the computed θ will never exceed the maximum possible deflection angle θ_max(M) for that M. Thus, we can always adjust the ramp.",
          "Step 4: Analyze option B: If θ_RAMP is fixed and M increases, the shock angle β for a weak shock decreases (shock becomes more aligned with the flow). Hence, β_SHOCK decreases, not increases.",
          "Step 5: Analyze option C: There is no upper critical Mach number that prevents finding a θ_RAMP for a given β_geom. The condition M > 1/sin(β_geom) is necessary and sufficient for an attached shock. As M increases further, the required θ approaches a finite asymptotic value, which is always ≤ θ_max(∞). So adjustment remains possible.",
          "Step 6: Analyze option D: The Mach angle μ = sin^{-1}(1/M) is the minimum angle for a disturbance. An attached oblique shock must have β > μ. Therefore, β_SHOCK > sin^{-1}(1/M), not less."

However, the chunks did not directly address the specific conceptual question about variable geometry adjustment with changing M. The principles were extracted from the examples and theory snippets. Internal knowledge was used to analyze the geometric constraint and asymptotic behavior."
