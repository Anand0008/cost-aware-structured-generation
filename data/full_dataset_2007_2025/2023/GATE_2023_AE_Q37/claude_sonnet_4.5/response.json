        "reasoning": "The question is asking about the behavior of the shock wave interaction with the cowl lip as the flight Mach number M is increased. Option A states that it is always possible to find a ramp setting θ_RAMP such that the shock still meets the cowl lip (β_SHOCK remains the same). This is correct based on the oblique shock theory.\n\nAs the Mach number M increases, the shock wave angle β_SHOCK will increase. However, by adjusting the ramp angle θ_RAMP, the flow deflection angle can be changed to maintain the same shock wave angle β_SHOCK such that the shock wave still meets the cowl lip. This is the key principle behind the variable geometry of supersonic air intakes, as depicted in the schematic diagram."
