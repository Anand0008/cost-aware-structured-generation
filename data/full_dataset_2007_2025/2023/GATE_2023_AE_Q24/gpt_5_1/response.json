At very high altitudes, atmospheric density \\(\\rho\\) is extremely small, so drag and hence deceleration are nearly zero. As the vehicle descends, density increases while velocity is still high, so \\(|dV/dt|\\) increases. After passing through the region of maximum deceleration, the rapidly decreasing velocity dominates over further density increase, so \\(|dV/dt|\\) decreases again toward lower altitudes. Thus, the qualitative variation of \\(|dV/dt|\\) with altitude is: small at high altitude, rising to a peak at some intermediate altitude, then decreasing toward lower altitude. Among the four plotted options, only graph D shows this non-monotonic behavior with a single peak in \\(|dV/dt|\\) at an intermediate altitude, matching the standard ballistic-entry result and Anderson's expression for maximum deceleration."
