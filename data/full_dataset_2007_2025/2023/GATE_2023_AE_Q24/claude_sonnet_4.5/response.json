At high altitudes, the vehicle experiences minimal drag and maintains nearly constant velocity, resulting in low deceleration.\n2. As the vehicle descends into denser atmosphere, drag increases rapidly, causing significant deceleration.\n3. The deceleration initially increases with decreasing altitude, reaches a maximum, and then decreases as the vehicle's velocity drops further.\n4. This qualitative trend matches the profile shown in graph D, which depicts the deceleration first increasing, reaching a peak, and then decreasing with decreasing altitude."
