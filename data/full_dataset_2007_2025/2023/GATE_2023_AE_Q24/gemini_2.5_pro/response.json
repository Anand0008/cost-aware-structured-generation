        "reasoning": "For a space vehicle undergoing ballistic entry, the deceleration `|dV/dt|` is primarily caused by atmospheric drag. The drag force `D` is given by $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_D S$, where $\\rho$ is atmospheric density, $V$ is velocity, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, and $S$ is the reference area. Thus, deceleration is $|dV/dt| = \\frac{D}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 \\frac{C_D S}{m}$.\\n\\n1.  **At very high altitudes (large $h$):** The atmospheric density $\\rho$ is extremely low. Even though the initial entry velocity $V$ is very high, the low density results in very small drag and thus very small deceleration. The graph should start with low deceleration at high altitude.\\n2.  **As the vehicle descends (decreasing $h$):** The atmospheric density $\\rho$ increases exponentially. Initially, the velocity $V$ remains relatively high. The increase in $\\rho$ dominates the equation, causing the deceleration $|dV/dt|$ to increase.\\n3.  **At an intermediate altitude:** As the vehicle penetrates deeper into the atmosphere, the drag force becomes significant, causing the velocity $V$ to decrease rapidly. At some point, the rate of decrease in $V^2$ starts to overshadow the rate of increase in $\\rho$. This leads to a maximum deceleration. The RAG context (CHUNK 1, 3, 4) explicitly states that maximum deceleration occurs at an intermediate altitude.\\n4.  **At lower altitudes (small $h$):** The velocity $V$ continues to decrease rapidly. Even though the density $\\rho$ is high, the squared velocity term $V^2$ becomes much smaller, causing the overall deceleration $|dV/dt|$ to decrease from its peak value. The graph should show deceleration decreasing towards lower values at low altitudes.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the qualitative variation of absolute deceleration with altitude should show an initial increase from a low value, reaching a peak at an intermediate altitude, and then decreasing towards a low value at lower altitudes. Graph D perfectly depicts this bell-shaped curve, with altitude $h$ on the y-axis and absolute deceleration $|dV/dt|$ on the x-axis."

          "Step 1: Understand the phenomenon of ballistic entry. This refers to atmospheric entry with zero lift, where drag is the primary force causing deceleration (L=0, D >> W).",
          "Step 2: Recall the governing equation for deceleration due to drag. The absolute deceleration is given by $|dV/dt| = D/m$, where $D$ is the drag force and $m$ is the mass of the vehicle. The drag force is $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_D S$, so $|dV/dt| = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 \\frac{C_D S}{m}$.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the variation of atmospheric density ($\\rho$) with altitude ($h$). Atmospheric density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude (e.g., $\\rho = \\rho_0 e^{-Zh}$). Conversely, density increases as altitude decreases.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the variation of vehicle velocity ($V$) with altitude. At very high altitudes, the atmosphere is thin, so drag is minimal, and the velocity remains close to the initial entry velocity ($V_E$). As the vehicle descends into denser layers, drag increases, causing the velocity to decrease significantly.",
          "Step 5: Combine the effects of density and velocity on deceleration. Initially, at high altitudes, $\\rho$ is very low, so $|dV/dt|$ is small. As $h$ decreases, $\\rho$ increases, and $V$ is still high, causing $|dV/dt|$ to increase. This continues until $V$ starts to drop significantly. The rapid decrease in $V^2$ eventually overcomes the increase in $\\rho$, leading to a peak deceleration. After this peak, as $V$ continues to decrease rapidly at lower altitudes, $|dV/dt|$ also decreases.",
          "Step 6: Match the qualitative behavior (low deceleration at high $h$, increasing to a peak, then decreasing at low $h$) with the provided graphs. Graph D shows this characteristic bell-shaped curve, where deceleration starts low at high altitude, increases to a maximum, and then decreases as altitude further reduces."
