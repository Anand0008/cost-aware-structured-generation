(9 km, 4 × 10^(-3) K/m): This is incorrect, as the temperature lapse rate in the troposphere is negative, not positive.\n\nC. (15 km, 0 K/m): This is correct, as the lower stratosphere (11-20 km) has an isothermal region with a temperature gradient of 0 K/m.\n\nD. (35 km, 3 × 10^(-3) K/m): This is correct, as the middle stratosphere (20-32 km) has a positive temperature gradient of +1 K/km or +1 × 10^(-3) K/m.\n\nTherefore, the combinations A, C, and D are in accordance with the ISA temperature profile."
