        "reasoning": "The propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) for an air-breathing jet engine is fundamentally defined as the ratio of the useful thrust power to the rate of kinetic energy imparted to the jet. For an ideal jet engine with negligible fuel mass flow and pressure thrust, the formula for propulsive efficiency is given by: $$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_j + V_a}$$ where $V_a$ is the aircraft's forward speed and $V_j$ is the jet exhaust speed relative to the engine. The problem states that the ratio $V_j / V_a = 2$. This implies $V_j = 2 V_a$. Substituting this relationship into the propulsive efficiency formula: $$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{2 V_a + V_a} = \\frac{2 V_a}{3 V_a}$$ Simplifying the expression by canceling $V_a$ from the numerator and denominator: $$\\eta_p = \\frac{2}{3}$$ Converting this fraction to a decimal value: $$\\eta_p \\approx 0.6666...$$ Rounding to two decimal places, the propulsive efficiency is approximately 0.67. This matches option D."
