        "reasoning": "The fundamental principle for forming a finite, closed body in potential flow using elementary solutions (like sources and sinks) is that the algebraic sum of all source and sink strengths must be zero. This condition ensures that the net flux of fluid generated within the body is zero, allowing for the formation of a bounding streamline that encloses a finite region. The uniform stream does not affect this condition for the formation of a closed body by sources/sinks. By summing the given source strengths and setting the total to zero, the unknown strength of the fifth source can be determined. The calculation is: $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4 + \\lambda_5 = 0$. Substituting the given values: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{5} + \\lambda_5 = 0$. Solving for $\\lambda_5$: $\\lambda_5 = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{5}) = -(1.570796 - 1.047198 + 0.785398 - 0.628319) = -(0.680677)$.
