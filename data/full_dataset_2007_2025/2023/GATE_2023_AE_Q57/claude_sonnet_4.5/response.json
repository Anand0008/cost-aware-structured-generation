This ensures the net flux of fluid generated within the body is zero, allowing for the formation of a bounding streamline.\n\nGiven the strengths of the four line sources as π/2, -π/3, π/4, and -π/5 at x = 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and the uniform stream of strength U along the x-axis, we can calculate the strength of the additional line source at x = 4 that would make the total source strength zero.\n\nLetting the strength of the additional line source be λ, the total source strength is:\nπ/2 - π/3 + π/4 - π/5 + λ = 0\nSolving for λ, we get:\nλ = -0.68\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives the answer range of -0.69 to -0.67, which matches the correct answer provided."
