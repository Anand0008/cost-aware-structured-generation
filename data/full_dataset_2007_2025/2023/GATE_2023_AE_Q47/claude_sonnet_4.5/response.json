The buckling load increases with an increase in the flexural rigidity (EI) of the column, as per the Euler buckling formula: P_cr = (n^2 * pi^2 * E * I) / L^2.\n\nC. The boundary conditions of the column (e.g., pinned, fixed, free) affect the effective length (L_e) used in the Euler formula, and thus the critical buckling load.\n\nD. The buckling load is not directly dependent on the density of the material used for the column, as the Euler formula does not include the density term. The material density would affect the overall weight of the column, but not the critical buckling load."
