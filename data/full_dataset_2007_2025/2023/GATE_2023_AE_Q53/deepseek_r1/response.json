Using r/t = 100, yield strength = 300 MPa, and the von Mises formula leads to P = 300 / (50√3) ≈ 3.4641 MPa ≈ 3.46 MPa."

However, no chunk explicitly gave the combined solution for a cylindrical vessel using von Mises. Chunk 5 gave von Mises formula and an example, but for a different stress state. Chunks 1 and 2 had examples for spherical and composite vessels, but not directly applicable. Thus, internal knowledge was used to derive the solution. RAG context was moderately helpful for formulas and concepts."
