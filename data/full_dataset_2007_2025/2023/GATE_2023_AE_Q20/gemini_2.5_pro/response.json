        "reasoning": "In a single-spool aviation turbojet engine, the compressor and turbine are mechanically coupled to the same shaft. The fundamental principle of operation for such an engine is that the entire work produced by the turbine is used to drive the compressor. This is based on the energy balance principle for the rotating components, neglecting mechanical losses and power extraction for accessories (as stated in the question, 'neglecting losses'). Therefore, the total work output of the turbine (`W_T`) must be equal to the total work required by the compressor (`W_C`). The number of stages in the compressor (6-stage) or turbine (2-stage) is irrelevant to this overall work balance; it only affects the work done per stage and the design specifics of each component, not the fundamental energy transfer between them in a single-spool configuration. This is explicitly stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, and 5, which all confirm `W_C = W_T`."
