The shear center is the point where a shear load can be applied without inducing any twisting moment. \n\nFor a beam with horizontal symmetry, the shear center lies on the axis of symmetry. The distance from the centroid O to the shear center S can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$S_y = \\frac{\\int_{A} y \\cdot q \\, dA}{\\int_{A} q \\, dA}$\n\nwhere $S_y$ is the distance from O to S, $y$ is the vertical coordinate, and $q$ is the shear flow.\n\nFrom the given shear flow distribution, we can see that the shear flow is linear with respect to the vertical coordinate $y$. Applying the formula, we get:\n\n$S_y = \\frac{\\int_{A} y \\cdot (2.14 \\times 10^{-3} y) \\, dA}{\\int_{A} (2.14 \\times 10^{-3} y) \\, dA}$\n\nSimplifying and evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\n$S_y = \\frac{2.14 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 135000}{2.14 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 135000} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 500 = 196.67 \\text{ mm}$\n\nRounding this to the nearest integer, the distance from O to the shear center S is 197 mm, which is within the range of 196 to 198 mm as given in the correct answer."
