The shear center is defined as the point where a transverse shear load can be applied without inducing any twisting moment. This implies that the sum of moments of all internal shear flows about the shear center must be zero. We will use this principle to find the location of 'S'.\n\n1.  **Define Coordinate System and Geometry:**\n    *   Let point 'O' be the origin (0",
