The shape of airfoil (D) appears to be more streamlined and optimized for transonic flow compared to the other airfoil profiles shown. At high subsonic Mach numbers around 0.8, the airfoil geometry needs to be carefully designed to manage shock waves and avoid excessive wave drag. The tapered, slender shape of airfoil (D) is likely to perform better in this speed regime than the other, more blunt airfoil profiles."
