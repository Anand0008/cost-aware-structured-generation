        "reasoning": "A civilian transport aircraft cruising at Mach 0.8 operates in the transonic regime. Efficient transonic airfoils are typically supercritical: they have a relatively flat or mildly cambered upper surface, a highly cambered lower surface, and maximum thickness located aft of mid-chord. This delays the onset of local supersonic flow and weakens the shock on the upper surface, reducing wave drag while maintaining good lift. \n\nFrom the schematics: \n- Option A shows a conventional, strongly cambered upper surface with a sharp trailing edge and relatively symmetric thickness distribution, typical of older subsonic airfoils; this tends to create strong upper-surface acceleration and strong shocks at Mach 0.8.\n- Option B has a very highly cambered upper surface and a thin lower surface, which would further intensify upper-surface acceleration and shock strength, making it poor for transonic cruise.\n- Option C is closer to a mildly cambered thin airfoil with a nearly straight lower surface, more suitable for low Mach numbers or symmetric applications, but not optimized for transonic drag reduction.\n- Option D clearly shows a flattened upper surface with modest curvature and a more cambered lower surface, with thickness biased aft, which is characteristic of a supercritical airfoil section used on modern transport aircraft wings for Mach 0.75–0.85 cruise.\n\nTherefore, option D is aerodynamically best suited for a civilian transport aircraft at Mach 0.8, consistent with the official key."
