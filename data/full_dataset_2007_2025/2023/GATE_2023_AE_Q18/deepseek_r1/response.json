This is best achieved with a supercritical airfoil. Key characteristics include a relatively flat upper surface to reduce local supersonic flow acceleration and shock strength, a cusp or reflexed lower surface near the trailing edge to provide aft camber and compensate for lift loss, and a relatively blunt leading edge to manage boundary layer and stall characteristics. From the provided image description, we infer that option D likely depicts such a supercritical profile, while others may be symmetrical (A), highly cambered low-speed (B), or conventional NACA 6-series (C) which are less optimized for transonic cruise."
