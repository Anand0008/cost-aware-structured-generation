        "reasoning": "The question asks for the shock angle $\\beta$ for an oblique shock generated by a compression corner. We are given the upstream Mach number $M_1 = 2$ and the flow deflection angle $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$. The gas is air, assumed calorically perfect with $\\gamma = 1.4$. A fundamental principle of oblique shock waves is that the shock angle $\\beta$ must always be greater than the Mach angle $\\mu$ of the upstream flow. The Mach angle is calculated as $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/M_1)$. For $M_1 = 2$, the Mach angle is $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/2) = 30^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the shock angle $\\beta$ must be greater than $30^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A. $\\beta = 20^{\\circ}$: This is less than $30^{\\circ}$, so it's incorrect.\n*   B. $\\beta > 20^{\\circ}$ and $< 30^{\\circ}$: This range is also less than $30^{\\circ}$, so it's incorrect.\n*   C. $\\beta = 30^{\\circ}$: This is equal to the Mach angle, which only occurs when the flow deflection angle $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$. Since $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$, this is incorrect.\n*   D. $\\beta > 30^{\\circ}$: This is the only option consistent with the physical requirement that $\\beta > \\mu$.\n\nFor verification, using a $\\theta-\\beta-M$ chart or solving the implicit $\\theta-\\beta-M$ equation for $M_1 = 2$ and $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$ (for $\\gamma = 1.4$), the weak shock solution for $\\beta$ is approximately $48.5^{\\circ}$. This value is indeed greater than $30^{\\circ}$, confirming option D."

          "Step 3: Recall the fundamental condition for the existence of an oblique shock. For an oblique shock to be formed and attached, its angle $\\beta$ must always be greater than the Mach angle $\\mu$ of the upstream flow.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the Mach angle $\\mu$ for the given upstream Mach number $M_1$. The formula for the Mach angle is $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/M_1)$. For $M_1 = 2$, $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/2) = 30^{\\circ}$.",
