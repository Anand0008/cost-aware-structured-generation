        "reasoning": "In lifting-line theory, for a given wing geometry (fixed span, chord distribution c(y), and zero-lift angle distribution \\alpha_{L=0}(y)), the Prandtl lifting-line equation is linear in circulation \\Gamma(y). The angle of attack \\alpha appears as a parameter on the left-hand side. Solving the integral equation yields \\Gamma(y) proportional to (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0}(y)) everywhere along the span. Since total lift coefficient C_L is proportional to the spanwise integral of \\Gamma(y), C_L is also linear in \\alpha. Therefore the lift-curve slope dC_L/d\\alpha is a constant (independent of \\alpha) as long as we remain within the validity of lifting-line theory (pre-stall, linear aerodynamics). Hence option A, 'independent of alpha', is correct."
