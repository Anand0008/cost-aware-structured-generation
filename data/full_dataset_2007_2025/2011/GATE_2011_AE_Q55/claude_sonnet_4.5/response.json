The lift curve slope `dC_L/dalpha` is the derivative of `C_L` with respect to the angle of attack `alpha`. Since the lift equation for a general wing is given as `C_L = 2*pi*(alpha - alpha_L=0)`, the lift curve slope `dC_L/dalpha` is simply `2*pi`, which is independent of the angle of attack `alpha`. Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
