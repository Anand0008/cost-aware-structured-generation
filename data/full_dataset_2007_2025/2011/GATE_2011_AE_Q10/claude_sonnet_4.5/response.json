Since the mass $m$ is the same for both systems, the ratio of the natural frequencies squared is equal to the ratio of the spring stiffnesses. Specifically, if $\\omega_{n1} = 10$ rad/s and $\\omega_{n2} = 20$ rad/s, then $\\frac{\\omega_{n2}^2}{\\omega_{n1}^2} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} = 4$, so $k_2 = 4k_1$."
