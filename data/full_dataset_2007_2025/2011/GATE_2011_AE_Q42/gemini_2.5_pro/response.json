        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the eccentricity and semi-major axis of an elliptical orbit given the perigee and apogee altitudes above the Earth's surface and the Earth's radius. The solution involves converting altitudes to radial distances from the Earth's center and then applying standard formulas for semi-major axis and eccentricity. \\n\\nGiven:\\nPerigee altitude ($h_p$) = 400 km\\nApogee altitude ($h_a$) = 3400 km\\nRadius of Earth ($R_E$) = 6400 km\\n\\n1.  **Calculate perigee radius ($r_p$):**\\n    The perigee radius is the distance from the center of the Earth to the perigee point.\\n    $r_p = R_E + h_p = 6400 \\text{ km} + 400 \\text{ km} = 6800 \\text{ km}$\\n\\n2.  **Calculate apogee radius ($r_a$):**\\n    The apogee radius is the distance from the center of the Earth to the apogee point.\\n    $r_a = R_E + h_a = 6400 \\text{ km} + 3400 \\text{ km} = 9800 \\text{ km}$\\n\\n3.  **Calculate semi-major axis ($a$):**\\n    For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is the average of the apogee and perigee radii (distances from the central body). This can be derived from $r_a = a(1+e)$ and $r_p = a(1-e)$. Adding these two equations gives $r_a + r_p = 2a$.\\n    $a = \\frac{r_a + r_p}{2} = \\frac{9800 \\text{ km} + 6800 \\text{ km}}{2} = \\frac{16600 \\text{ km}}{2} = 8300 \\text{ km}$\\n\\n4.  **Calculate eccentricity ($e$):**\\n    The eccentricity can be found by subtracting the perigee radius equation from the apogee radius equation: $r_a - r_p = a(1+e) - a(1-e) = 2ae$. \\n    So, $e = \\frac{r_a - r_p}{2a}$.\\n    Alternatively, substituting $2a = r_a + r_p$, we get $e = \\frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p}$.\\n    $e = \\frac{9800 \\text{ km} - 6800 \\text{ km}}{9800 \\text{ km} + 6800 \\text{ km}} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ km}}{16600 \\text{ km}} \\approx 0.18072$\\n    Rounding to two decimal places, $e \\approx 0.18$.\\n\\nTherefore, the eccentricity is approximately 0.18 and the semi-major axis is 8300 km, which corresponds to Option A."
