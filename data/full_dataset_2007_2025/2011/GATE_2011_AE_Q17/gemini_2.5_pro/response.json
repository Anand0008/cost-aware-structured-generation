        "reasoning": "For an airplane to possess static longitudinal stability, any disturbance in its angle of attack must generate a restoring pitching moment that tends to bring the aircraft back to its original trimmed condition. This fundamental requirement is met when the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) is located ahead of its neutral point (NP). The neutral point is defined as the longitudinal location where the pitching moment coefficient of the entire aircraft does not change with angle of attack (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial C_M}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0$). If the CG is ahead of the NP, a nose-up disturbance (increase in $\\alpha$) will create a nose-down restoring moment, thus ensuring static stability. Conversely, if the CG is aft of the neutral point, a nose-up disturbance would generate a further nose-up moment, leading to static instability. This principle is consistently stated across multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5)."

          "Step 3: Relate CG and NP for static stability. For an aircraft to be statically stable, a disturbance (e.g., an increase in angle of attack) must create a moment that opposes the disturbance. This condition is met when the CG is located forward (ahead) of the NP.",
          "Step 4: Consider the implications of CG location relative to NP. If CG is ahead of NP, the static margin is positive, indicating stability. If CG is at NP, static margin is zero, indicating neutral stability. If CG is aft of NP, static margin is negative, indicating instability.",
