This condition is met if and only if the center of gravity (CG) is located ahead of (forward of) the neutral point (NP). The neutral point is the CG location for which $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0$. If the CG is at the NP, the aircraft is neutrally stable. If the CG is behind the NP, the slope becomes positive, indicating static instability. This is a standard, textbook definition confirmed by multiple RAG chunks (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5). The wing aerodynamic centre (AC) is not the correct reference for a complete aircraft; the neutral point, which accounts for the entire aircraft including tail contributions, is the correct stability reference."

Option A ('ahead of wing aerodynamic centre') is incorrect because the wing AC alone does not determine the stability of the whole aircraft; the NP does.
