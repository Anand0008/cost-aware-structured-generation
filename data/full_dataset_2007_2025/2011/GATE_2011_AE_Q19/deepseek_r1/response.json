For subsonic, incompressible flow, it is approximately at 25% of the chord from the leading edge (0.25c). However, as flow becomes supersonic, the formation of shock waves and the change in pressure distribution cause the AC to shift rearwards. Standard aerodynamics theory states that for a thin airfoil in purely supersonic flow, the aerodynamic center is located at 50% of the chord (0.5c). This is a well-established result supported by linearized supersonic flow theory and is explicitly mentioned in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 & 5)."
