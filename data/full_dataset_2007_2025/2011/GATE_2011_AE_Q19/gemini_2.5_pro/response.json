According to fundamental aerodynamics principles, specifically as outlined in the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 1 and 5), the aerodynamic center shifts aft as the Mach number increases from subsonic to supersonic regimes. For purely supersonic flow, the aerodynamic center is located approximately at 50% of the chord (0.5c) from the leading edge. This is a well-established rule in high-speed aerodynamics. Therefore, option C (0.5c) is the correct answer."
