          "Step 1: Identify the type of ODE. Given $\\frac{dy}{dt} = y^3 e^t t^2$, this is a first-order ODE with variables separable because the right-hand side is a product of functions of $t$ and $y$.",

          "Step 3: Integrate both sides. $\\int y^{-3} \\, dy = \\int e^t t^2 \\, dt$.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the integrals. Left side: $\\int y^{-3} \\, dy = -\\frac{1}{2} y^{-2} + C_1$. Right side: Use integration by parts twice. Let $I = \\int e^t t^2 \\, dt$. Set $u = t^2$, $dv = e^t dt$, then $du = 2t dt$, $v = e^t$, so $I = t^2 e^t - \\int 2t e^t \\, dt = t^2 e^t - 2\\int t e^t \\, dt$. Now integrate $\\int t e^t \\, dt$ by parts: $u = t$, $dv = e^t dt$, $du = dt$, $v = e^t$, so $\\int t e^t \\, dt = t e^t - \\int e^t \\, dt = t e^t - e^t$. Thus, $I = t^2 e^t - 2(t e^t - e^t) + C_2 = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) + C_2$.",
          "Step 5: Combine results and include constant. $-\\frac{1}{2} y^{-2} = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) + C$, where $C = C_2 - C_1$ is the combined constant.",
          "Step 6: Apply initial condition $y(0)=1$. Substitute $t=0$, $y=1$: $-\\frac{1}{2} (1)^{-2} = e^0 (0 - 0 + 2) + C$ gives $-\\frac{1}{2} = 2 + C$, so $C = -\\frac{5}{2}$.",
          "Step 7: Solve for $y$. Substitute $C$: $-\\frac{1}{2} y^{-2} = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) - \\frac{5}{2}$. Multiply both sides by $-2$: $y^{-2} = -2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) + 5$, so $\\frac{1}{y^2} = 5 - 2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2)$.",
          "Step 8: Invert and take square root. $y^2 = \\frac{1}{5 - 2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2)}$. Since $y(0)=1 > 0$, we take the positive square root: $y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5 - 2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2)}}$, which matches option D."

        "guessing_heuristic": "If time is short, notice that options A and C are rational functions, while B and D involve square roots. The ODE is nonlinear (y^3), so the solution likely involves a square root (since integration of y^{-3} gives y^{-2}). So eliminate A and C. Between B and D, plug t=0: B gives sqrt(9/(5+2*1*(0-0+2))) = sqrt(9/9)=1, D gives sqrt(1/(5-2*1*(0-0+2))) = sqrt(1/(5-4))=1. Now check derivative at t=0 approximately: from ODE, dy/dt at t=0 = 1^3 * e^0 * 0^2 = 0. Compute derivative of option D at t=0? Might be zero. Option B derivative at t=0? Possibly not zero. But safer to solve quickly.",

While not directly solving the given ODE, they provide background on separable ODE methods and the importance of initial conditions. Chunk 1 shows solving dy/dt = y (a simpler separable ODE), which is analogous. Chunk 5 discusses dy/dt = y^2, which is structurally similar (nonlinear separable). However, the specific integral ∫ e^t t^2 dt and the full solution were not in RAG, so internal knowledge was used for the derivation. Overall, RAG offers contextual support but not the complete solution."
