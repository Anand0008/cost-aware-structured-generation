Integrate both sides: \\(\\int y^{-3} dy = \\int e^t t^2 dt\\). Left side: \\(\\int y^{-3} dy = -\\frac{1}{2y^2} + C\\). Right side: use integration by parts or the known formula \\(\\int t^2 e^t dt = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) + C\\). Thus, \\(-\\frac{1}{2y^2} = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) + C\\). Apply the initial condition \\(t=0, y=1\\): \\(-\\frac{1}{2} = e^0 (0 - 0 + 2) + C = 2 + C\\), so \\(C = -\\frac{5}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(-\\frac{1}{2y^2} = e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2) - \\frac{5}{2}\\). Multiply by \\(-2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{y^2} = 5 - 2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2)\\). Hence \\(y^2 = \\frac{1}{5 - 2 e^t (t^2 - 2t + 2)}\\).
