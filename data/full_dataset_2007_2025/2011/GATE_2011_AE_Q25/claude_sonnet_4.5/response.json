        "reasoning": "The propulsion efficiency of a jet engine is directly proportional to the thrust power and inversely proportional to the air mass flow rate. This can be derived from the fundamental equation for propulsion efficiency:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 \\cdot V_a}{V_e + V_a}$\n\nWhere $V_a$ is the aircraft velocity and $V_e$ is the jet exit velocity. The thrust power is given by $T \\cdot V_a$, where $T$ is the thrust. Since $T = \\dot{m}_a \\cdot (V_e - V_a)$, the thrust power can be written as $\\dot{m}_a \\cdot (V_e - V_a) \\cdot V_a$. Substituting this into the propulsion efficiency equation, we get:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 \\cdot V_a}{V_e + V_a} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (T \\cdot V_a)}{\\dot{m}_a \\cdot (V_e^2 - V_a^2)}$\n\nThis shows that propulsion efficiency is directly proportional to the thrust power and inversely proportional to the air mass flow rate, confirming that option C is the correct answer."
