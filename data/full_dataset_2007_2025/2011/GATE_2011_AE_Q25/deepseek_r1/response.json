From the definition: η_p = (T·U) / [0.5·ṁ·(U_e² - U²)], where ṁ is the air mass flow rate, assuming ṁ_e ≈ ṁ_a = ṁ and negligible pressure thrust. For given flight (U) and exhaust (U_e) velocities, this expression shows η_p is directly proportional to thrust power (T·U) and inversely proportional to ṁ. This matches option C. The simplified formula η_p = 2U/(U_e+U) is derived by substituting T = ṁ(U_e - U), but that formula shows η_p is independent of ṁ only when T is expressed in terms of ṁ. The definition itself gives the proportionality in option C."

          "Step 3: Apply common simplifying assumptions: fuel mass flow is negligible (ṁ_f << ṁ_a), so ṁ_e ≈ ṁ_a = ṁ, and nozzle is perfectly expanded (pressure thrust negligible). The thrust equation simplifies to T = ṁ(U_e - U).",
          "Step 4: Substitute these into the definition: η_p = [ṁ(U_e - U)·U] / [0.5·ṁ·(U_e² - U²)] = [(U_e - U)U] / [0.5·(U_e - U)(U_e + U)] = 2U/(U_e+U). This simplified form shows η_p depends only on flight speed (U) and exhaust speed (U_e).",
          "Step 5: Analyze the proportionality: From the definition before substitution (η_p = (T·U) / [0.5·ṁ·(U_e² - U²)]), if we consider U and U_e fixed, then η_p is directly proportional to thrust power (T·U) and inversely proportional to air mass flow rate (ṁ).
