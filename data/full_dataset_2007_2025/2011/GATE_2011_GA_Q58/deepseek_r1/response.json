Option B ('Surviving') is a gerund and could also function as a subject, but in this specific context, the infinitive is preferred to emphasize the purpose or the act considered in a general sense.

          "   - C. 'Survival': A noun. While a noun can be a subject, the phrase 'Survival in the frozen wastes...' would typically be followed by 'requires', not 'takes'. Also, it sounds less natural than the infinitive.",
