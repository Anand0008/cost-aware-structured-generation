        "reasoning": "The sentence requires an infinitive phrase to act as the subject or complement. The structure 'To + verb' (infinitive) is used to express purpose or to function as a noun (subject or object). In this sentence, 'To survive' functions as the subject of the sentence, meaning 'The act of surviving in the frozen wastes of Arctic requires special equipment.'\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   **A. To survive**: This is an infinitive phrase. It correctly functions as the subject of the sentence, making the sentence grammatically sound: 'To survive in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment.'\n*   **B. Surviving**: This is a gerund (verb-ing form acting as a noun). While 'Surviving' can also function as a subject (e.g., 'Surviving is hard'), in this specific sentence structure, 'To survive' is more idiomatic and grammatically preferred when referring to the general act or necessity of survival in a particular context, especially when followed by 'takes' (meaning 'requires'). 'Surviving in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment' is grammatically acceptable but 'To survive' is a stronger fit for the implied necessity or challenge.\n*   **C. Survival**: This is a noun. If 'Survival' were used, the sentence would read 'Survival in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment.' While grammatically correct, it changes the nuance slightly from the active 'to survive' to the state of 'survival'. However, 'To survive' is often preferred when describing the action required.\n*   **D. That survival**: This option is grammatically incorrect. 'That survival' would introduce a dependent clause or refer to a specific instance of survival, neither of which fits the sentence structure or meaning here. It would create an awkward and incomplete sentence."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the sentence structure. The sentence begins with a blank, followed by a prepositional phrase ('in the frozen wastes of Arctic'), and then the verb 'takes' (meaning 'requires') and its object ('special equipment'). This indicates that the blank must be filled with a subject that can perform the action of 'taking' or 'requiring'.",
          "Step 2: Identify the grammatical role required for the blank. The blank needs a noun phrase or a verb form acting as a noun (gerund or infinitive) to serve as the subject of the sentence.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate option A, 'To survive'. This is an infinitive phrase. Infinitives (to + verb) can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. Here, 'To survive' functions as a noun, acting as the subject of the verb 'takes'. The sentence 'To survive in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment' is grammatically correct and idiomatic.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate option B, 'Surviving'. This is a gerund. Gerunds (verb-ing) also function as nouns. While 'Surviving in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment' is grammatically plausible, the infinitive 'To survive' often implies purpose or a general truth/necessity more strongly, making it a better fit for the context of 'takes special equipment'.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate option C, 'Survival'. This is a noun. 'Survival in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment' is grammatically correct. However, 'To survive' emphasizes the action or effort required, which aligns well with the verb 'takes' (requires).",
          "Step 6: Evaluate option D, 'That survival'. This phrase is grammatically incorrect in this context. 'That' would typically introduce a clause or specify a particular instance, neither of which works here.",
          "Step 7: Compare the best options (A, B, C). Both 'To survive' and 'Survival' are grammatically correct and convey similar meanings. However, 'To survive' is often preferred when describing the general act or challenge that requires something, making it the most appropriate and idiomatic choice for this sentence in a formal context like a GATE exam."
