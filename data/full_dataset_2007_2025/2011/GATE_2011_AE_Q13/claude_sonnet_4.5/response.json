        "reasoning": "The correct answer is A. Multi-staging in rockets improves the burnout performance by increasing the payload mass ratio. This is because by shedding the structural mass of the spent stages, the mass ratio (initial mass to final mass) is increased, leading to a higher burnout velocity as per the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. The retrieved knowledge clearly explains this principle and how multi-staging allows for higher mass ratios compared to a single-stage rocket."
