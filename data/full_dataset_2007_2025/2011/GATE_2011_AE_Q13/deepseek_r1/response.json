        "reasoning": "The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation states that the change in velocity ($\\Delta V$) for a stage is proportional to the natural logarithm of its mass ratio ($m_0 / m_f$), where $m_0$ is initial mass and $m_f$ is final mass. In multi-staging, after a stage expends its propellant, its structural mass is jettisoned. For the subsequent stage, the 'payload' (i.e., the mass it must accelerate) now excludes the spent stage's structure. This effectively resets the initial and final masses for the next stage, leading to a higher mass ratio ($m_{0,i} / m_{f,i}$) for that stage compared to if it had to carry the dead weight. Therefore, the primary stage-wise improvement is in the mass ratio, which directly translates to higher burnout velocity. Option A correctly identifies this as 'payload mass ratios,' where 'payload' in this context refers to the mass (including subsequent stages and final payload) that a given stage must propel."

          "Step 3: Recognize the limitation of a single-stage rocket: the structural mass (tanks, engines) must be carried throughout the entire flight, limiting the achievable mass ratio and thus $\\Delta V$.",
          "Step 4: Understand the principle of multi-staging: a rocket is divided into multiple independent stages. Once a stage's propellant is exhausted, its structural mass is discarded.",
          "Step 5: Analyze the effect on the next stage: By discarding the spent structure, the initial mass for the next stage is significantly reduced. The 'payload' for the next stage is now just the remaining vehicle (subsequent stages + final payload), not the dead weight of the previous stage's structure.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that this shedding of mass stage-by-stage effectively increases the mass ratio for each subsequent stage, allowing each to contribute a larger $\\Delta V$ than it could if it were part of a single, monolithic vehicle. This is the core mechanism for performance improvement.",
