'Preponderance' means 'the quality or fact of being greater in number, quantity, or importance' (a majority or superiority). This fits perfectly: the greater weight or majority of evidence supported the plaintiff. 'Paucity' (scarcity) contradicts the context. 'Propensity' (inclination) does not fit the evidence itself.
