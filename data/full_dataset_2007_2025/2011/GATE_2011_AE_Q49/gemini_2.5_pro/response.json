Slope is zero: $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0$.\\n    At a fixed end, there is a reaction bending moment and a reaction shear force. Therefore, the bending moment and shear force are generally non-zero.\\n    Bending moment is proportional to the second derivative of displacement: $M = EI \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}$.

Therefore, at $x=0$, the displacement $w(0,t)$ must be zero, and the slope $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}(0,t)$ must be zero. Importantly, a fixed support *can* transmit bending moment and shear force, so these are generally non-zero.",
          "Step 3: Recall the standard boundary conditions for a free end. A free end allows both translation and rotation. Therefore, at $x=L$, there is no external bending moment or shear force applied. This means the bending moment $M(L,t)$ must be zero, and the shear force $V(L,t)$ must be zero.",
