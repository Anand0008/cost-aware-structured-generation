A cantilever has a fixed end at x = 0 and a free end at x = L. At the fixed end: deflection and slope are zero, so w(0,t) = 0 and \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0. At the free end: bending moment and shear force are zero, so \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(L,t) = 0 and \\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}(L,t) = 0. Therefore options A, B, and D are valid boundary conditions for this cantilever. Option C, \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(0,t) = 0, would imply zero bending moment at the fixed end, which contradicts the nature of a fixed support that can transmit moment.
