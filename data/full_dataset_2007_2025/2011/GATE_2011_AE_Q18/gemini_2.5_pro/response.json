        "reasoning": "The question states that the drag polar of a certain aerofoil is symmetric about the $C_d$ axis. This characteristic is unique to symmetric airfoils.\n\n1.  **Understanding Drag Polar Symmetry**: The drag polar is a plot of the drag coefficient ($C_d$) versus the lift coefficient ($C_l$). For a drag polar to be symmetric about the $C_d$ axis, it implies that for any given magnitude of lift coefficient (e.g., $C_l = 0.5$ or $C_l = -0.5$), the drag coefficient ($C_d$) is the same. Mathematically, this means $C_d(C_l) = C_d(-C_l)$. This behavior is typical of symmetric airfoils, where the aerodynamic characteristics (like drag) are similar for positive and negative angles of attack that produce equal magnitudes of lift.\n\n2.  **Characteristics of Symmetric Airfoils**: A symmetric airfoil has no camber (i.e., its mean camber line is straight and coincides with the chord line). Consequently, a symmetric airfoil produces zero lift at zero angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0} = 0$). Its lift curve ($C_l$ vs $\\alpha$) passes through the origin. For a cambered airfoil, $\\alpha_{L=0}$ is negative, and the drag polar is shifted, meaning minimum drag occurs at a positive $C_l$, and the curve is not symmetric about the $C_d$ axis.\n\n3.  **NACA Airfoil Nomenclature (from RAG Chunk 2)**:\n    *   **NACA Four-Digit Series (e.g., NACA 2412)**: The first digit represents the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord. A symmetric airfoil has no camber, so its first digit (and usually the second, indicating camber location) will be zero.\n    *   **NACA 0012**: The '00' indicates zero maximum camber and zero location of maximum camber. This unequivocally identifies it as a symmetric airfoil.\n    *   **NACA 4415**: The '4' as the first digit indicates 4% maximum camber. This is a cambered airfoil.\n    *   **NACA 23012**: This is a NACA Five-Digit Series airfoil. The first digit '2' (when multiplied by 3/2) gives a design lift coefficient of 0.3, which implies it is a cambered airfoil. (RAG Chunk 2).\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since a symmetric drag polar about the $C_d$ axis is characteristic of a symmetric airfoil, and NACA 0012 is the only symmetric airfoil among the options, option A is the correct answer."
