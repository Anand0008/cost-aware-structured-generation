This means $(x+T)^2 = x^2$, which expands to $x^2 + 2xT + T^2 = x^2$. This simplifies to $2xT + T^2 = 0$. For this equation to hold for all $x$, we must have $2T=0$ and $T^2=0$, which implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = x^2$ is not periodic.\\nB. $f(x) = \\log x$: If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $\\log(x+T) = \\log x$. For this equality to hold, $x+T = x$, which implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = \\log x$ is not periodic.\\nC. $f(x) = e^x$: If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $e^{x+T} = e^x$, which can be written as $e^x e^T = e^x$. Dividing by $e^x$ (which is never zero), we get $e^T = 1$. This implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = e^x$ is not periodic.\\nD. $f(x) = \\text{const.}$: Let $f(x) = C$, where $C$ is any real constant. If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. For a constant function, $f(x+T) = C$ and $f(x) = C$. Thus, $C = C$, which is true for any positive constant $T$. Therefore, a constant function is periodic (with any positive real number as its period)."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Recall the fundamental definition of a periodic function. A function $f(x)$ is periodic if there exists a positive constant $T$ (the period) such that $f(x+T) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. The key is that $T$ must be strictly greater than zero.",
          "Step 2: Evaluate Option A, $f(x) = x^2$. Assume it is periodic, so $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $(x+T)^2 = x^2$. Expanding the left side gives $x^2 + 2xT + T^2 = x^2$. Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides yields $2xT + T^2 = 0$. For this equation to hold for all values of $x$, the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term must be zero. This implies $2T=0$ and $T^2=0$, both leading to $T=0$. Since $T$ must be positive, $f(x) = x^2$ is not periodic.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option B, $f(x) = \\log x$. Assume it is periodic, so $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $\\log(x+T) = \\log x$. Due to the one-to-one property of the logarithm function, this implies $x+T = x$, which simplifies to $T=0$. As $T$ must be positive, $f(x) = \\log x$ is not periodic.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C, $f(x) = e^x$. Assume it is periodic, so $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $e^{x+T} = e^x$. Using exponent rules, this becomes $e^x e^T = e^x$. Dividing both sides by $e^x$ (which is never zero) gives $e^T = 1$. The only real solution for $T$ is $T=0$. As $T$ must be positive, $f(x) = e^x$ is not periodic.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option D, $f(x) = \\text{const.}$. Let $f(x) = C$ for some constant $C$. Assume it is periodic, so $f(x+T) = f(x)$. For a constant function, $f(x+T)$ is simply $C$, and $f(x)$ is also $C$. So, $C = C$. This equality holds true for any positive value of $T$. Therefore, a constant function is periodic (it has infinitely many periods, any positive real number can be considered a period)."
