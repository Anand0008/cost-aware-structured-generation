          "Step 1: Understand Airy's Stress Function. Airy's stress function `$\\phi(x,y)$` is a scalar function used in two-dimensional elasticity problems (plane stress or plane strain) to simplify the solution process. It ensures that the equilibrium equations (without body forces) are automatically satisfied when the stress components are derived from it. For a valid stress field, `$\\phi$` must also satisfy the biharmonic equation, `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`.",
          "Step 2: Recall the relations between Airy's stress function and stress components. The normal and shear stress components in Cartesian coordinates are derived from `$\\phi$` using the following partial derivatives:\n    *   `$\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`\n    *   `$\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`\n    *   `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`",
          "Step 3: Analyze the given boundary conditions. The problem states constant boundary conditions: `$\\sigma_{xx} = P$`, `$\\sigma_{yy} = Q$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = R$`. This implies that the stress field throughout the body is uniform and constant. A quadratic polynomial form for Airy's stress function typically leads to such constant stress states.",
          "Step 4: Systematically test each given option by calculating the stress components. For each option, compute the second partial derivatives with respect to `x` and `y` according to the formulas from Step 2.",
          "Step 5: Compare the derived stresses with the given boundary conditions. Select the option whose derived `$\\sigma_{xx}$`, `$\\sigma_{yy}$`, and `$\\tau_{xy}$` exactly match `P`, `Q`, and `R` respectively. As shown in the detailed reasoning, Option C yields `$\\sigma_{xx} = P$`, `$\\sigma_{yy} = Q$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = R$`."
