        "reasoning": "To find the minimum value of a multivariable function, we first find the critical points by setting all its first-order partial derivatives to zero. The given function is $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6x_3 + 14$.\n\n1.  Calculate the partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6x_3 + 14) = 2x_1 - 2$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6x_3 + 14) = 2x_2 - 4$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6x_3 + 14) = 2x_3 - 6$\n\n2.  Set each partial derivative to zero to find the critical points:\n    *   $2x_1 - 2 = 0 \\implies 2x_1 = 2 \\implies x_1 = 1$\n    *   $2x_2 - 4 = 0 \\implies 2x_2 = 4 \\implies x_2 = 2$\n    *   $2x_3 - 6 = 0 \\implies 2x_3 = 6 \\implies x_3 = 3$\n\n    Thus, the only critical point is $(1, 2, 3)$.\n\n3.  To confirm this critical point is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test (Hessian matrix) or complete the square.\n    *   **Method 1: Completing the Square**\n        Rewrite the function by completing the square for each variable:\n        $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1) + (x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 4) + (x_3^2 - 6x_3 + 9) + 14 - 1 - 4 - 9$\n        $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - 1)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 + (x_3 - 3)^2 + 0$\n        Since $(x_1 - 1)^2$, $(x_2 - 2)^2$, and $(x_3 - 3)^2$ are always non-negative, the minimum value of $f$ is 0, which occurs when each squared term is zero. This happens when $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 2$, and $x_3 = 3$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Hessian Matrix (Second Derivative Test)**\n        Calculate the second-order partial derivatives:\n        $f_{x_1x_1} = 2$, $f_{x_2x_2} = 2$, $f_{x_3x_3} = 2$\n        $f_{x_1x_2} = 0$, $f_{x_1x_3} = 0$, $f_{x_2x_3} = 0$\n        The Hessian matrix $H$ is:\n        $H = \\begin{pmatrix} f_{x_1x_1} & f_{x_1x_2} & f_{x_1x_3} \\\\ f_{x_2x_1} & f_{x_2x_2} & f_{x_2x_3} \\\\ f_{x_3x_1} & f_{x_3x_2} & f_{x_3x_3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        The principal minors are:\n        $D_1 = 2 > 0$\n        $D_2 = \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = 4 > 0$\n        $D_3 = \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = 8 > 0$\n        Since all principal minors are positive, the critical point $(1, 2, 3)$ corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the function has its minimum value at $(1, 2, 3)$. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
