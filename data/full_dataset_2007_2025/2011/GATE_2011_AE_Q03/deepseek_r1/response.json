The minimum point is found by setting the gradient to zero, which yields $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (1, 2, 3)$. This is confirmed by completing the square, which rewrites the function as a sum of squares: $(x_1-1)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 + (x_3-3)^2$. The minimum value is $0$, achieved at $(1,2,3)$."

          "Step 3: Set each partial derivative to zero and solve: $2x_1 - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_1 = 1$; $2x_2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 2$; $2x_3 - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_3 = 3$. So the critical point is $(1,2,3)$.",
          "Step 4: Verify that this critical point is a minimum. Compute the Hessian matrix (matrix of second derivatives): $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. It is diagonal with positive entries, indicating positive definiteness. Therefore, the critical point is a local minimum. Since the function is a convex quadratic (sum of squares after completing the square), it is a global minimum.",
          "Step 5 (Alternative method - Completing the square): Rewrite $f$ by grouping terms: $(x_1^2 - 2x_1) + (x_2^2 - 4x_2) + (x_3^2 - 6x_3) + 14$. Complete the square for each group: $(x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1) - 1 = (x_1-1)^2 - 1$, $(x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 4) - 4 = (x_2-2)^2 - 4$, $(x_3^2 - 6x_3 + 9) - 9 = (x_3-3)^2 - 9$. Thus, $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_1-1)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 + (x_3-3)^2 + (14 -1 -4 -9) = (x_1-1)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 + (x_3-3)^2$. This is a sum of squares, minimized when each square is zero, i.e., at $(1,2,3)$."
