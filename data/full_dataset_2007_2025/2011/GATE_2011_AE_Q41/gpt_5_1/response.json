        "reasoning": "For an equilibrium (steady) glide with no thrust, the glide path angle \\(\\gamma\\) satisfies \\(\\tan\\gamma = D/L = 1/(L/D)\\). With a constant lift-to-drag ratio of 15, \\(\\tan\\gamma = 1/15\\). The horizontal range from altitude \\(h\\) is \\(R = h\\cot\\gamma = h(L/D)\\). Given \\(h = 1000\\,\\text{m}\\) and \\(L/D = 15\\), \\(R = 1000 \\times 15 = 15000\\,\\text{m} = 15\\,\\text{km}\\). Endurance is the time to descend 1000 m at the vertical sink speed. The glider is towed to 1000 m in 50 s by a jeep moving at 54 km/h (15 m/s). During the tow, the glider is already in equilibrium climb relative to the air, so its airspeed along the flight path is 15 m/s. The climb angle \\(\\gamma_c\\) satisfies \\(\\sin\\gamma_c = h/(V t) = 1000/(15 \\times 50) = 4/3\\), which is impossible, so we must reinterpret: the intended use of the jeep speed is to give the glide speed after release: \\(V = 54\\,\\text{km/h} = 15\\,\\text{m/s}\\). For an equilibrium glide, the same speed is maintained. Then vertical speed is \\(V_z = V\\sin\\gamma\\). With \\(\\tan\\gamma = 1/15\\), \\(\\sin\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1+15^2} = 1/\\sqrt{226} \\approx 0.0665\\). Thus \\(V_z \\approx 15 \\times 0.0665 \\approx 0.9975\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Endurance \\(E = h/V_z \\approx 1000/0.9975 \\approx 1002.5\\,\\text{s}\\), which matches option A (1002.2 s) within rounding. Options B, C, and D either use wrong range (1 km) or wrong time (50 or 601 s). Therefore, A is consistent with standard gliding-flight relations and the given data."
