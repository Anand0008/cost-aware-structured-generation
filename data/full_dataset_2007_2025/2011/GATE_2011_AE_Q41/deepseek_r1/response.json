The glide angle $\\theta$ satisfies $\\tan \\theta = 1/(L/D) = 1/15$. The vertical component of velocity, $V_v = V \\sin \\theta$. The horizontal velocity $V$ at the start of the glide is given as the jeep's speed: $54 \\, \\text{kmph} = 15 \\, \\text{m/s}$. For small $\\theta$, $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\tan \\theta$. Thus, $V_v \\approx V \\times (1/15) = 1 \\, \\text{m/s}$. Endurance $t = h / V_v = 1000 / 1 = 1000 \\, \\text{s}$. The slight discrepancy to 1002.2 s in option A likely comes from using the exact trigonometric relation: $\\sin(\\arctan(1/15)) = 1/\\sqrt{226} \\approx 0.066519$, so $V_v = 15 \\times 0.066519 \\approx 0.9978 \\, \\text{m/s}$, giving $t \\approx 1002.2 \\, \\text{s}$.

        "notes": "RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) provided excellent foundational knowledge on gliding flight, including the key range formula ($R = h \\times (L/D)$) and force balance. It explained the relationship between glide angle and L/D. However, it did not explicitly provide the method to calculate endurance (time) which requires combining the glide angle with the initial velocity. This gap was filled using internal knowledge of kinematics. The video note in Chunk 6 contained a discrepancy in the formula for CL for max L/D, which was noted but was not directly relevant to this problem since L/D was given as constant."
