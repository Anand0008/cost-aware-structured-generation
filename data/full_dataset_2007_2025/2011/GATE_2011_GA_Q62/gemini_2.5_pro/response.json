This implies that the coefficient of $x$ was correctly written. The roots obtained were (4, 3). The sum of these roots is $4 + 3 = 7$. Therefore, the correct sum of roots for the actual equation is 7. From Vieta's formulas, $-P = 7$, so the correct coefficient of $x$ is $P = -7$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second attempt:** The student incorrectly wrote the coefficient of $x$. This implies that the constant term was correctly written. The roots obtained were (3, 2). The product of these roots is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. Therefore, the correct product of roots for the actual equation is 6. From Vieta's formulas, $Q = 6$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the correct quadratic equation:** Using the correct coefficient of $x$ ($P = -7$) and the correct constant term ($Q = 6$), the correct quadratic equation (assuming a leading coefficient of 1) is $x^2 + (-7)x + 6 = 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Find the roots of the correct equation:** To find the roots of $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$, we can factorize it: $(x-1)(x-6) = 0$. The roots are $x=1$ and $x=6$. This matches option C."

For simplicity, assume $a=1$, so the equation is $x^2 - (\\alpha + \\beta)x + (\\alpha \\beta) = 0$.",
