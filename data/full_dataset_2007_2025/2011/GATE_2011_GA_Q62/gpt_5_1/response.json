In the second attempt, only the coefficient of x is wrong: equation is x^2 + b_2 x + c = 0 with roots 3 and 2. Sum of roots = -b_2 = 3 + 2 = 5, so b_2 = -5. Product of roots = c = 3·2 = 6. Therefore the correct quadratic is x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0, whose roots are found by factoring: x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0, so roots are 1 and 6, i.e., (6, 1). This matches option C."
