        "reasoning": "The problem describes an aircraft in steady level flight that suddenly rolls 180 degrees and becomes inverted, with no other changes to configuration or controls. This implies the aircraft is performing a 'pull-down' maneuver in the vertical plane, where the lift force, due to the inverted orientation, now acts downwards, adding to the weight to provide the centripetal force for the turn.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: Steady level flight means Lift (L) = Weight (W). The load factor (n) is defined as L/W. So, initially, n = 1.\n2.  **Inverted Flight**: When the aircraft rolls 180 degrees and becomes inverted, 'no other changes are made to the configuration or controls' implies that the *magnitude* of the lift generated by the wing remains the same as in steady level flight. Therefore, the magnitude of lift L is still equal to the weight W. This means the load factor (magnitude) `n = L/W = 1` even in the inverted state.\n3.  **Pull-down Maneuver**: In inverted flight, the lift force, which is generated perpendicular to the wing's chord line, now points downwards (towards the Earth) because the aircraft is upside down. Both the lift and the weight contribute to the centripetal force required for the downward circular path.\n4.  **Equation for Pull-down**: The net force towards the center of curvature (downwards) is `F_c = L + W`. This centripetal force is also given by `F_c = m * V^2 / R`, where `m` is the mass, `V` is the speed, and `R` is the radius of curvature. Substituting `m = W/g` and `L = nW` (where `n` is the magnitude of the load factor):\n    `nW + W = (W/g) * V^2 / R`\n    `(n + 1) W = (W/g) * V^2 / R`\n    Dividing by W:\n    `(n + 1) = (1/g) * V^2 / R`\n    Rearranging for R:\n    `R = V^2 / (g * (n + 1))`\n5.  **Calculation**: Given `V = 50 m/s`, `g = 9.81 m/s^2`, and `n = 1` (as derived above):\n    `R = (50^2) / (9.81 * (1 + 1))`\n    `R = 2500 / (9.81 * 2)`\n    `R = 2500 / 19.62`\n    `R \\approx 127.42 m`\n6.  **Flight Path**: Since both lift (downwards) and weight (downwards) contribute to the centripetal force, the aircraft will follow a downward circular path.\n\nComparing this result with the options:\nOption C: downward circular path with a speed of 50 m/s and radius of 127.4 m. This matches our calculation."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the initial condition. The aircraft is in steady level flight, which means the lift (L) equals the weight (W). The load factor (n) is defined as L/W, so in this state, $n=1$.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the maneuver. The aircraft rolls 180 degrees and becomes inverted. The crucial phrase 'no other changes are made to the configuration or controls' implies that the *magnitude* of the lift force generated by the wings remains the same as in steady level flight. Therefore, the magnitude of lift (L) is still equal to the weight (W), meaning the load factor (n) for the inverted flight (in terms of magnitude of lift) is still $n=1$.",
          "Step 3: Determine the direction of forces. In the inverted position, the lift force, which is always perpendicular to the wing's chord line and typically 'upwards' relative to the wing, now acts *downwards* relative to the Earth. The weight (W) also acts downwards. Both forces contribute to the centripetal force required for the turn.",
          "Step 4: Apply Newton's Second Law for circular motion. The net force towards the center of curvature (which is downwards for this maneuver) provides the centripetal acceleration. Thus, $F_c = L + W$. We also know that $F_c = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$, where $m$ is the mass, $V$ is the speed, and $R$ is the radius of curvature.",
          "Step 5: Substitute and simplify. Replace $m$ with $W/g$ and $L$ with $nW$. The equation becomes $nW + W = \\frac{W}{g} \\frac{V^2}{R}$. This simplifies to $(n+1)W = \\frac{W}{g} \\frac{V^2}{R}$.",
          "Step 6: Solve for the radius of curvature (R). Cancel W from both sides and rearrange: $R = \\frac{V^2}{g(n+1)}$.",
          "Step 7: Plug in the given values. Given $V = 50 \\text{ m/s}$, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$, and $n = 1$ (from Step 2). Calculate $R = \\frac{(50)^2}{9.81(1+1)} = \\frac{2500}{9.81 \\times 2} = \\frac{2500}{19.62} \\approx 127.42 \\text{ m}$.",
          "Step 8: Conclude the nature of the flight path. Since both lift and weight are acting downwards, the aircraft will follow a downward circular path."
