After a 180° roll to inverted, the lift vector reverses direction (acts downward) while magnitude remains approximately W if controls and configuration are unchanged (symmetric airfoil assumption). Thus, both weight and lift act downward, creating a net downward centripetal force for a downward circular path. Using the pull-down maneuver formula: R = V²/(g(n+1)), with V=50 m/s, g=9.81 m/s², n=1, yields R ≈ 127.4 m. Speed remains 50 m/s initially as thrust and drag are unchanged."
