        "reasoning": "The question states that the aircraft suddenly rolls by 180 degrees and becomes inverted, but no other changes are made to the configuration or controls. In this case, the aircraft will experience a downward circular path with a speed of 50 m/s and a radius of 127.4 m. This is because in the inverted position, the lift force (L) acts downwards, adding to the weight (W) to provide the centripetal force required for the downward turn. The turn radius can be calculated using the formula R = V^2 / (g(n+1)), where n is the load factor. Since n = -1 in this case (inverted flight), the radius becomes R = V^2 / (g(1+1)) = 50^2 / (9.81*2) = 127.4 m."
