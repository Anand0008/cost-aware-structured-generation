        "reasoning": "Initially the aircraft is in steady level flight, so lift equals weight: $L = W$. The aircraft then rolls 180° and becomes inverted, with no change in controls or configuration. That means the magnitude of lift remains $L = W$, but its direction reverses and now acts downward, same direction as weight. The speed is unchanged at $V = 50\\,\\text{m/s}$ immediately after the roll. The aircraft now has two downward forces, $L$ and $W$, providing centripetal force for a downward circular path (pull-down maneuver). Using $F_c = m V^2 / R$ and $L + W = m V^2 / R$, with $L = W$ and $m = W/g$, we get $2W = (W/g) V^2 / R \\Rightarrow R = V^2 / (2g) = 50^2 / (2 \\times 9.81) \\approx 127.4\\,\\text{m}$.
