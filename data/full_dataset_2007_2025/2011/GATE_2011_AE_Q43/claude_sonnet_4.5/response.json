From this, we can calculate the damping ratio and natural frequency of the phugoid mode, which then allows us to determine the eigenvalues. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. The phugoid mode completes 10 cycles in 50 s, so the period (T) is 50/10 = 5 s.\n2. The time for the amplitude to reduce to half is 25 s, which is the time to half amplitude (T_half).\n3. The damping ratio (zeta) can be calculated from the time to half amplitude using the formula: zeta = -ln(2) / (omega_n * T_half)\n4. Substituting the values, we get: zeta = -ln(2) / (2*pi/T * 25) = -0.0278\n5. The natural frequency (omega_n) can be calculated from the period: omega_n = 2*pi/T = 1.26 rad/s\n6. The eigenvalues of the phugoid mode are then: s = -zeta*omega_n +/- i*omega_n*sqrt(1-zeta^2) = -0.0278 +/- 1.26i\n\nThis matches the correct answer option C: -0.028 +/- 1.26i."
