Since the problem specifies air as a calorically perfect gas (i.e., its specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$ are constant), the total enthalpy is directly proportional to the total temperature ($h_0 = c_p T_0$). As $c_p$ is constant for a calorically perfect gas, the conservation of total enthalpy implies the conservation of total temperature across the shock. Therefore, the total temperature at point P (after the shock) is equal to the free stream total temperature ($T_{0P} = T_{0\\infty}$). \\n\\nFirst, calculate the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) using the given ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) and the specific gas constant ($R$):\\n$c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$\\nGiven $\\gamma = 1.4$ and $R = 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$:\\n$c_p = \\frac{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{1.4 - 1} = \\frac{401.8 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{0.4} = 1004.5 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\\n\\nThe free stream total enthalpy is given as $h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\text{ kJ kg}^{-1}$.

Chunk 2 and Chunk 3 also offered context on total temperature and specific heat in energy equations, reinforcing the underlying principles. The RAG context was sufficient to answer the question."
