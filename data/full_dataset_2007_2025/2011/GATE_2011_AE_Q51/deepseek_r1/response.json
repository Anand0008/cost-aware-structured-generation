This is a fundamental principle in gas dynamics. The flow over a compression corner involves an oblique shock, but across an adiabatic shock, the total temperature is conserved. The free stream total enthalpy is given directly. Therefore, T0 at any point in the flow, including point P, equals the free stream total temperature, which is calculated from h0_inf and the specific heat at constant pressure (cp) derived from gamma and R. The calculation yields exactly 806.37 K."
