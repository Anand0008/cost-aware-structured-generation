        "reasoning": "Jet engines (e.g., turbojets, turbofans) are air-breathing propulsion systems that operate on the Brayton cycle. According to thermodynamic principles and standard textbooks (e.g., Hill & Peterson, P.K. Nag), the Brayton cycle for jet engines is inherently an open cycle because air is continuously drawn from the atmosphere, compressed, heated via combustion, expanded, and exhausted. The Rankine cycle is used for steam power plants and is not applicable to jet engines. While Brayton cycles can be closed in some gas turbine applications (e.g., nuclear power), jet engines specifically require atmospheric air intake, making only the open Brayton cycle feasible. This is strongly supported by retrieved knowledge chunks, especially CHUNK 4 which explicitly states: 'The ideal thermodynamic cycle for a turbojet engine is the Brayton cycle. It's an open cycle...'"
