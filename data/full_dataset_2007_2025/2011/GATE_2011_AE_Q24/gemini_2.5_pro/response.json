        "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge consistently states that the ideal thermodynamic cycle for jet engines (gas turbines) is the Brayton cycle. Furthermore, it explicitly clarifies that actual jet engines operate in an \"open cycle\" mode, where atmospheric air is continuously drawn in, processed, and exhausted, rather than recirculating a fixed working fluid as in a closed cycle. Chunks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 all support this. Specifically, Chunk 4 states, \"The ideal thermodynamic cycle for a turbojet engine is the Brayton cycle. It's an open cycle...\" and Chunk 6 differentiates between open and closed Brayton cycles, describing open cycles as those where air is exhausted to the atmosphere. Therefore, \"open Brayton cycle only\" is the most accurate description for the thermodynamic cycle on which a jet engine operates."

          "Step 4: Distinguish between open and closed cycles. The RAG context (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 6) emphasizes that while the theoretical Brayton cycle can be analyzed as a closed cycle under air standard assumptions, actual jet engines operate as *open* cycles. This means fresh air is continuously drawn from the atmosphere, compressed, heated, expanded, and then expelled as exhaust, rather than recirculating a fixed working fluid.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options. Options A and B (Rankine cycle) are incorrect as the Rankine cycle is for vapor power plants. Option D ('either open or closed Brayton cycle') is less precise because, while a theoretical closed Brayton cycle exists, jet engines *specifically* operate as open cycles. Option C ('open Brayton cycle only') accurately describes the thermodynamic cycle of a jet engine."
