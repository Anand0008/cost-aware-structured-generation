Young's modulus $E = 50 \\text{ GPa} = 50 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$. The point load $P = 1$ N is applied at mid-span, so the distance from the fixed end to the load is $a = L/2 = 0.5$ m.",

This formula accounts for both the deflection at the load point and the additional deflection due to the slope of the beam from the load point to the free end.",
