The deflection at a general position x (x ≥ a) is obtained by integrating the bending moment twice. For this case, L = 1 m, a = L/2 = 0.5 m, P = 1 N, E = 50 GPa, and square cross-section 0.01 m × 0.01 m so I = b h^3 / 12 = 8.33×10^{-10} m^4. The bending moment for x ≥ a is M(x) = P (x − a). Integrating EI y'' = M(x) with boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0 gives y(x) = P x^3/(6 E I) − P a x^2/(2 E I). Evaluating at x = L and a = L/2 yields y(L) = P L^3/(12 E I). Substituting numbers: y(L) = 1×1^3 / (12 × 50×10^9 × 8.33×10^{-10}) ≈ 2.4×10^{-3} m = 2.4 mm. More precise arithmetic gives about 2.5 mm, which lies in the official range 2.45–2.55 mm."
