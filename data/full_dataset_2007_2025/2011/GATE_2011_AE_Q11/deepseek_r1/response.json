The degree of static indeterminacy (external) is given by $i = r - 3$, where $r$ is the number of unknown reaction components. A simply supported beam (pin at one end, roller at the other) has $r = 3$ (two from pin, one from roller), so $i = 0$ (determinate). A fixed-fixed beam has $r = 6$ (three reactions per fixed end: $F_x$, $F_y$, and $M$), so $i = 3$. Therefore, the degree of indeterminacy increases from $0$ to $3$, an increase of $3$."
