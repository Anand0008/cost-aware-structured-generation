A simply supported beam has a pin at one end (2 reaction components: horizontal and vertical) and a roller at the other (1 vertical reaction). Thus the total number of reaction unknowns is \\(R_{ss} = 3\\). Since \\(R_{ss} = 3\\), the degree of static indeterminacy is \\(i_{ss} = R_{ss} - 3 = 0\\); it is statically determinate. A fixed-fixed beam in 2D has each fixed support providing 3 reaction components (horizontal, vertical, and moment), so the total number of unknown reactions is \\(R_{ff} = 3 + 3 = 6\\). The degree of static indeterminacy is then \\(i_{ff} = R_{ff} - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3\\). Therefore, when converting from simply supported (indeterminacy 0) to fixed-fixed (indeterminacy 3), the degree of static indeterminacy increases by 3. Hence option A is correct."

        "Ask students to modify one support (e.g., replace roller with fixed) and predict the new degree of indeterminacy.",
        "Include internal hinges and ask for combined external and internal degree of indeterminacy of a frame."
