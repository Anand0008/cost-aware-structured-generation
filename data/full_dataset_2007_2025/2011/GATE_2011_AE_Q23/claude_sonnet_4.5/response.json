        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C, 'pressure gradient induced separation in that stage'. This is because the pressure ratio in a compressor stage is limited by the adverse pressure gradient on the blade surfaces, which can cause the boundary layer to separate. This flow separation leads to significant losses and reduced efficiency, limiting the achievable pressure ratio. The other options are not the primary limiting factors - entry stagnation temperature (A) and entry Mach number (B) can also affect performance, but pressure gradient-induced separation is the key limitation in a single compressor stage."
