        "reasoning": "The pressure ratio achievable in any single stage of a jet engine compressor is fundamentally limited by aerodynamic phenomena, primarily flow separation. As air flows through the diffusing passages between compressor blades, its velocity decreases, and its static pressure increases. This increase in pressure in the direction of flow creates an 'adverse pressure gradient'. If this pressure gradient becomes too steep, the boundary layer on the blade surface can separate from the surface. Flow separation leads to significant losses, reduced efficiency, and can cause compressor stall, where the pressure rise collapses. Therefore, the maximum pressure ratio per stage is limited by the ability to maintain attached flow and avoid pressure gradient induced separation. \\n\\nOption A (entry stagnation temperature) affects the density and thus the mass flow capacity and overall performance, but it's not the direct aerodynamic limit on pressure ratio per stage. \\nOption B (entry Mach number) is a significant factor. High relative Mach numbers can lead to shock waves and stronger adverse pressure gradients, which in turn can cause shock-induced boundary layer separation. While a high Mach number is a cause, the direct phenomenon limiting the pressure rise is the separation itself. \\nOption D (mass flow rate) is an operating parameter and a consequence of the design and operating point, not a fundamental limit on the achievable pressure ratio per stage."

          "Step 4: Understand the consequences of flow separation in a compressor. Separation leads to highly turbulent flow, significant energy losses, a drastic reduction in efficiency, and ultimately limits the stable pressure rise that can be achieved in that stage. This can lead to compressor stall or surge.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options in light of this understanding. Pressure gradient induced separation directly limits the stable pressure rise. Other factors like entry Mach number can contribute to the severity of the pressure gradient or introduce other losses (like shocks), but separation is the direct aerodynamic mechanism that prevents further pressure increase in a stable manner."
