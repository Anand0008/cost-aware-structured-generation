        "reasoning": "In a compressor stage, work is done on the air to increase its pressure. This creates an adverse pressure gradient (pressure increasing in the flow direction). If the pressure rise (and thus the adverse pressure gradient) is too high, the boundary layer on the blade surfaces (particularly on the suction side) will separate from the surface. This separation causes massive losses, efficiency drop, and can lead to stall or surge, which are catastrophic for engine operation. Therefore, the stage pressure ratio is fundamentally limited by the onset of pressure gradient induced boundary layer separation. While other factors (like entry Mach number) influence the design and performance, the primary, fundamental limit is separation."

          "Step 1: Understand the function of a compressor stage. A compressor stage (rotor + stator) adds energy to the airflow, increasing its stagnation pressure and temperature. The blades act as airfoils, generating a pressure difference.",
          "Step 2: Recognize the aerodynamic challenge. To increase pressure, the flow must be diffused (decelerated). This deceleration creates an adverse pressure gradient (pressure increases in the flow direction).",
          "Step 3: Identify the primary flow limitation. Fluid flow in an adverse pressure gradient is inherently unstable. The boundary layer (slow-moving air near the blade surface) loses kinetic energy and can reverse direction, leading to flow separation from the blade surface.",
          "Step 4: Connect separation to pressure ratio. The severity of the adverse pressure gradient is directly related to the amount of pressure rise (pressure ratio) attempted in a single stage. A higher target pressure ratio requires stronger diffusion, which creates a steeper adverse pressure gradient.",
          "Step 5: Conclude the limiting factor. The maximum achievable pressure ratio in a stage is the point just before significant boundary layer separation occurs. Beyond this, efficiency plummets and operational instability (rotating stall, surge) becomes likely, limiting the stage's practical design."
