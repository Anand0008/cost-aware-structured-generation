        "reasoning": "The correct phrase is 'delivered on (promises)' which means to fulfill or carry out promises. Option A ('delivered') is incomplete and grammatically awkward in this context. Option C ('forgot') changes the meaning illogically; forgetting a promise is different from not fulfilling it. Option D ('reneged on') means to go back on or break a promise, but the word 'never' before it would create a positive meaning ('he never broke his promises'), which contradicts the first part of the sentence ('We lost confidence in him'). Therefore, 'never delivered on the promises' correctly explains the loss of confidence."

        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the sentence structure and meaning. The first clause states a consequence: 'We lost confidence in him'. The second clause, starting with 'because', must give a reason for that loss of confidence. The reason must be something negative he failed to do regarding his 'grandiose promises'.",
          "Step 2: Analyze each option in the context of the blank and the object 'the grandiose promises he had made'.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'delivered'. While one can 'deliver a promise', it is more common to say 'deliver on a promise'. The standalone verb 'delivered' sounds incomplete and is less idiomatic here.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: 'delivered on'. This is the standard phrasal verb 'deliver on (a promise/commitment)', meaning to fulfill what was promised. It fits perfectly: he never fulfilled his promises, leading to lost confidence.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'forgot'. This means to fail to remember. While not fulfilling a promise could stem from forgetting, the direct object 'promises' is odd with 'forgot' in this context. More importantly, the core reason for lost confidence is typically failure to act, not failure to remember.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: 'reneged on'. This means to go back on a promise, to break it. However, the sentence uses 'never'. 'He never reneged on the promises' means he always kept them, which would be a positive trait and would NOT cause a loss of confidence. This creates a direct logical contradiction with the first clause.",
          "Step 7: Synthesize: Only option B provides the correct idiomatic expression and maintains logical consistency within the sentence."
