        "reasoning": "The sentence requires a phrasal verb or idiomatic expression that means 'to fulfill' or 'to make good on' promises. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 'delivered': While one can 'deliver a speech' or 'deliver a package', 'deliver promises' is not the standard idiomatic expression for fulfilling them. It sounds incomplete in this context.\n\nB. 'delivered on': This is the correct idiomatic phrasal verb, meaning 'to fulfill a promise or commitment'. When someone 'delivers on a promise', they do what they said they would do. This fits the context perfectly, as the lack of fulfilling promises led to a loss of confidence.\n\nC. 'forgot': If he 'forgot' the promises, it implies a memory lapse, not necessarily a failure to act on them due to inability or unwillingness. While forgetting could lead to not fulfilling, it changes the nuance of the sentence from a failure to act to a failure to remember.\n\nD. 'reneged on': To 'renege on' a promise means to go back on it, to break it, or to refuse to fulfill it after having made it. While this also implies not fulfilling promises and would lead to a loss of confidence, 'delivered on' is the direct opposite of the implied failure to fulfill, making it the most appropriate and direct completion of the sentence's intended meaning. 'Delivered on' implies a failure to meet expectations, whereas 'reneged on' implies a more active retraction or betrayal. The sentence 'he never _______ the grandiose promises' suggests a failure to meet them rather than an active breaking of them, making 'delivered on' a better fit for the general failure to fulfill."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Application",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Read the sentence carefully to understand its context and the intended meaning. The sentence states, 'We lost confidence in him because he never __________ the grandiose promises he had made.' This implies that the promises were not fulfilled, leading to a negative outcome (loss of confidence).",
          "Step 2: Consider the grammatical structure and the type of word or phrase needed. We need a verb or phrasal verb that describes the action (or lack thereof) regarding 'promises'.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate option A, 'delivered'. While 'deliver' can mean to present or hand over, 'deliver promises' is not the standard idiomatic way to express fulfilling them in English. It feels incomplete.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate option B, 'delivered on'. The phrasal verb 'to deliver on' (a promise, a commitment, an expectation) means to fulfill it or to do what was promised. This perfectly fits the context of not fulfilling promises, leading to a loss of confidence.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate option C, 'forgot'. If he 'forgot' the promises, it implies a memory issue. While forgetting could lead to not fulfilling, it's not the primary meaning conveyed by 'never' in this context, which suggests a consistent failure to act, not just a lapse of memory.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate option D, 'reneged on'. To 'renege on' a promise means to go back on it or break it. This is a strong negative term and implies an active decision to not fulfill. While it's plausible, 'delivered on' is a more direct and common idiom for the general act of fulfilling (or failing to fulfill) promises, especially when the sentence structure emphasizes the 'never' doing so.",
          "Step 7: Compare the most suitable options. 'Delivered on' is the most appropriate and idiomatic choice for expressing the fulfillment of promises, making its negation ('never delivered on') the best fit for the sentence's meaning."
