There are 3 children ahead of N, so N is 4th in the queue: n = 4.\n\n2) There are 8 children between M and N. So the distance in positions between M and N is 9. Thus M can be either 9 ahead of N or 9 behind N.\n   - Case 1: M ahead of N: m = n - 9 = 4 - 9 = -5 (impossible, position cannot be negative).\n   - Case 2: M behind N: m = n + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13. So M is at position 13.\n\n3) There are 5 children between L and M, so the distance between L and M is 6. Thus L can be 6 ahead of M or 6 behind M.\n   - Option A: L ahead of M: l = m - 6 = 13 - 6 = 7.\n   - Option B: L behind M: l = m + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19.\n\n4) We are also told there are 21 children behind L. That means the total number of children in the queue is L\\'s position plus 21: total = l + 21.\n   - For l = 7: total = 7 + 21 = 28.\n   - For l = 19: total = 19 + 21 = 40.\n\n5) The question asks for the minimum number of children in the queue. Among the two consistent totals (28 and 40), the minimum is 28.\n\nThus option A (28) is correct and consistent with all given constraints."
