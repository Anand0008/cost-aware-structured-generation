        "reasoning": "The bypass in a turbofan engine is designed to accelerate a large mass of air (the bypass air) to a moderate velocity, which then exits through a separate bypass nozzle (or mixes with the core exhaust). This significantly increases the total mass flow rate of air expelled from the engine, thereby increasing the propulsive thrust. As stated in RAG CHUNK 3, \"This bypassed air generates thrust in addition to the hot exhaust from the core.\" This directly implies an increase in the total mass flow rate contributing to exhaust thrust. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because the bypass stream's objective is not to increase the overall engine inlet mass flow (it *is* part of it, but not the objective), nor to directly increase turbine inlet temperature or core compressor pressure ratio."

          "Step 2: Recall the structure of a turbofan engine. It features a large fan at the front that splits incoming air into two streams: a core stream (passing through compressor, combustor, turbine) and a bypass stream (flowing around the core engine).",
          "Step 3: Identify the role of the bypass stream. The bypass stream is accelerated by the fan and then exits through a bypass nozzle, contributing significantly to the total thrust.",
          "Step 4: Compare turbofans to turbojets. Turbofans achieve higher propulsive efficiency at subsonic speeds by accelerating a *larger mass of air* (including the bypass air) to a *lower exhaust velocity* compared to turbojets, which accelerate a smaller mass to a very high velocity.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding. Option A (mass flow rate through engine inlet) is incorrect because while bypass utilizes a large portion of inlet air, increasing inlet mass flow is not the *objective* of the bypass itself. Option B (turbine inlet temperature) and D (compressor pressure ratio) are core engine parameters, not directly related to the bypass stream's primary function.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that increasing the mass flow rate through the exhaust nozzle (specifically, the total exhaust mass flow including bypass) is a main objective, as the bypass air directly adds to the mass expelled, generating thrust."
