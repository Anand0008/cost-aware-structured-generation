        "reasoning": "The main objective of the bypass in a turbofan engine is to increase the mass flow rate through the exhaust nozzle. This is because the bypass stream generates a significant portion of the thrust by accelerating a large mass of air to a moderate velocity, which is more efficient than the high-velocity exhaust from the core engine alone. The bypass ratio (ratio of bypass mass flow to core mass flow) is a key parameter that determines the propulsive efficiency of the turbofan, and increasing the bypass mass flow rate directly increases the thrust. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
