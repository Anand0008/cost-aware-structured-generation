        "reasoning": "The primary purpose of the bypass stream in a turbofan is to increase the mass flow rate through the exhaust system (bypass nozzle) to improve propulsive efficiency. The bypass air, accelerated by the fan, generates additional thrust without passing through the core (combustor, turbine). This increases the total mass flow rate exiting the exhaust nozzle(s) compared to a turbojet, leading to higher thrust at lower specific fuel consumption for subsonic flight. Options A, B, and D are incorrect: Bypass does not inherently increase turbine inlet temperature (B) or compressor pressure ratio (D). While the fan draws more air into the inlet, increasing overall mass flow rate through the engine (A), that is a consequence, not the primary objective; the objective is to increase exhaust mass flow for thrust generation."

          "Step 2: Recognize the primary advantage of adding a bypass stream. By accelerating a large mass of air (bypass flow) to a moderate velocity, the engine generates additional thrust with higher propulsive efficiency than a turbojet (which accelerates a smaller mass to a very high velocity).",
          "Step 3: Connect bypass to exhaust mass flow. The bypass air joins (in mixed turbofans) or exits separately (in unmixed turbofans) from the core exhaust, effectively increasing the total mass flow rate through the exhaust nozzle(s).",
          "Step 4: Evaluate each option critically. Option A (mass flow rate through engine inlet) is true but secondary; the inlet mass flow increases because of the fan, but the objective is to utilize that air for thrust via the exhaust. Option B (turbine inlet temperature) is determined by combustor design and materials, not bypass. Option D (compressor pressure ratio) is a core compressor characteristic, not directly increased by bypass; the fan has its own pressure ratio. Option C directly captures the thrust-generation mechanism: more mass flow through the exhaust nozzle."
