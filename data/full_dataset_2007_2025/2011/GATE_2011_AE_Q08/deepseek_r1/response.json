In the context of frame analysis, 'joint degrees of freedom' often refers to the unknown displacement components (translations and rotations) at the joints. For an indeterminate structure, these unknown displacements (or the associated forces) are greater in number than the equilibrium equations that can be written from statics alone. The RAG context consistently states that for indeterminate systems, unknowns > equilibrium equations. Therefore, option B is correct. Option A describes a statically determinate condition. Option C is incorrect for an indeterminate structure. Option D is false because indeterminate structures can be solved using mechanics, but require additional compatibility equations."
