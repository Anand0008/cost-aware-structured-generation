        "reasoning": "A statically indeterminate frame structure is defined as one where the number of unknown forces (external reactions and internal member forces) exceeds the number of independent equations of static equilibrium. While this definition focuses on forces, the question relates to 'joint degrees of freedom' and 'equilibrium equations'.\n\nFor a 2D plane frame, the number of independent global equilibrium equations is three: $\\sum F_x = 0$, $\\sum F_y = 0$, and $\\sum M_z = 0$. These are the fundamental equations of statics for the entire structure.\n\nThe 'number of joint degrees of freedom' ($D_k$) represents the number of independent displacements (translations and rotations) that can occur at the joints of the frame. For a general frame structure, especially a multi-jointed or multi-story frame, even if it is statically indeterminate (meaning it has redundant supports or members), it can still possess a significant number of joint degrees of freedom. For instance, a multi-story, multi-bay frame fixed at its base is highly statically indeterminate, but its upper joints will have many degrees of freedom.\n\nComparing the number of joint degrees of freedom ($D_k$) with the 3 global equilibrium equations, it is generally true for a typical frame structure that $D_k > 3$. For example, a single-bay, single-story frame fixed at its base is statically indeterminate ($D_s=3$), but it has 6 joint degrees of freedom (3 at each of the two top joints). In this case, $6 > 3$, which aligns with option B.\n\nOptions A and C are not universally true for all statically indeterminate frames (e.g., a fixed-fixed beam, which is indeterminate, has 0 joint DOFs, implying $D_k < 3$). Option D is incorrect as joint degrees of freedom can be determined using laws of mechanics (e.g., displacement method)."
