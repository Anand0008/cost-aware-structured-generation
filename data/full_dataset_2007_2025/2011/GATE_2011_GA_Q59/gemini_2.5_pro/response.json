For the second scholarship, there are also 4 possible applicants it can be awarded to (since repetition is allowed).\n3.  For the third scholarship, there are again 4 possible applicants it can be awarded to.\n\nSince the awarding of each scholarship is an independent event, the total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for each scholarship.\nTotal number of ways = (Choices for Scholarship 1) $\\times$ (Choices for Scholarship 2) $\\times$ (Choices for Scholarship 3)\nTotal number of ways = $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^3 = 64$."
