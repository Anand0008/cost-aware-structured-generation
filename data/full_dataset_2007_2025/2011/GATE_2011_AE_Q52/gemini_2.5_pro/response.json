        "reasoning": "The problem asks to choose a material such that the weight of the shaft is minimum, given that it must transmit a specific torque. For a thin-walled hollow shaft, the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) is related to the applied torque (T), mean radius (R), and wall thickness (t) by the approximation: $\\tau_{max} \\approx \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 t}$. To prevent yielding, $\\tau_{max}$ must be less than or equal to the shear yield stress ($\\tau_y$) of the material. Thus, the minimum required thickness ($t_{min}$) is $t_{min} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y}$. The weight (W) of the shaft is given by $W = A_{CS} L \\rho$, where $A_{CS}$ is the cross-sectional area, L is the length, and $\\rho$ is the density. For a thin-walled hollow shaft, $A_{CS} \\approx 2 \\pi R t$. Substituting $t_{min}$ into the weight formula: $W = (2 \\pi R \\left( \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y} \\right)) L \\rho = \\frac{T L \\rho}{R \\tau_y}$. Since T, L, and R are constant for all materials, to minimize the weight W, we need to minimize the ratio $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$.\n\nCalculating $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ for each material:\n1.  **Material X:** $\\frac{\\rho_X}{\\tau_{yX}} = \\frac{7700 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{550 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 14 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n2.  **Material Y:** $\\frac{\\rho_Y}{\\tau_{yY}} = \\frac{2700 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{225 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 12 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n3.  **Material Z:** $\\frac{\\rho_Z}{\\tau_{yZ}} = \\frac{4875 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{375 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n\nComparing these values, Material Y has the minimum $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ ratio ($12 \\times 10^{-6}$).

          "Step 1: Understand the objective and constraints. The objective is to minimize the weight of a thin-walled hollow shaft, subject to the constraint that it must transmit a given torque without yielding. The 'thin-walled' condition implies using specific approximations for torsional analysis.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) in a thin-walled hollow circular shaft. For a thin-walled shaft with mean radius R and thickness t, the polar moment of inertia is approximately $J \\approx 2 \\pi R^3 t$. The maximum shear stress is given by $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T R}{J}$, which simplifies to $\\tau_{max} \\approx \\frac{T R}{2 \\pi R^3 t} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 t}$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the strength criterion. The maximum shear stress must not exceed the material's shear yield stress ($\\tau_y$). Therefore, $\\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 t} \\le \\tau_y$. To find the minimum required thickness ($t_{min}$), we set $\\tau_{max} = \\tau_y$, which gives $t_{min} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y}$.",
          "Step 4: Recall the formula for the weight (W) of the shaft. The weight is given by $W = A_{CS} L \\rho$, where $A_{CS}$ is the cross-sectional area, L is the length, and $\\rho$ is the density. For a thin-walled hollow shaft, the cross-sectional area is approximately $A_{CS} \\approx 2 \\pi R t$.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the minimum thickness ($t_{min}$) into the weight formula. $W = (2 \\pi R \\left( \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y} \\right)) L \\rho$. This simplifies to $W = \\frac{T L \\rho}{R \\tau_y}$.",
          "Step 6: Identify the optimization parameter. Since the torque (T), length (L), and mean radius (R) are constant for all materials, the weight W is directly proportional to the ratio $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$. To minimize W, we must choose the material with the minimum $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ ratio.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ ratio for each material and select the one with the lowest value. Convert $\\tau_y$ from MPa to Pa for consistent units. For Material X: $\\frac{7700}{550 \\times 10^6} = 14 \\times 10^{-6}$. For Material Y: $\\frac{2700}{225 \\times 10^6} = 12 \\times 10^{-6}$. For Material Z: $\\frac{4875}{375 \\times 10^6} = 13 \\times 10^{-6}$. Material Y has the lowest ratio."
