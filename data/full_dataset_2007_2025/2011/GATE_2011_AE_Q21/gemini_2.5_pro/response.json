        "reasoning": "The flow over a spinning circular cylinder with circulation is modeled by superimposing three elementary potential flows: a uniform flow, a doublet, and a vortex. The stream function for each component is:\n1.  **Uniform flow:** $\\psi_{\\text{uniform}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta$\n2.  **Doublet:** A doublet of strength $\\mu$ at the origin, when combined with a uniform flow, forms a circular cylinder of radius $R$. The stream function for the doublet is $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta$. For a cylinder of radius $R$, $\\mu = 2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2$. Substituting this, $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta = -V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta$.\n3.  **Vortex:** For a counter-clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$, the stream function for a point vortex at the origin is typically given as $\\psi_{\\text{vortex}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$.\n\nCombining these, the total stream function is:\n$\\psi = \\psi_{\\text{uniform}} + \\psi_{\\text{doublet}} + \\psi_{\\text{vortex}}$\n$\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta - V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$\n$\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$\n\nThe question specifies that $\\psi = 0$ on the cylinder surface ($r=R$). Let's check the value of this stream function at $r=R$:\n$\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$\n$\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R (0) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$\n\nTo ensure $\\psi = 0$ at $r=R$, we must subtract the constant term $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$ from the stream function. This is equivalent to replacing $\\ln(r)$ with $\\ln(r) - \\ln(R) = \\ln(r/R)$.\n\nTherefore, the stream function satisfying $\\psi = 0$ at $r=R$ is:\n$\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)$\n\nThis expression matches option C exactly."

          "Step 1: Understand the physical model. The flow over a spinning circular cylinder with circulation is a classic potential flow problem, modeled by superimposing three basic flow elements: a uniform flow, a doublet, and a point vortex.",
          "Step 2: Recall the stream function for a uniform flow. For a uniform flow $V_{\\text{inf}}$ in the positive x-direction, the stream function in polar coordinates is $\\psi_{\\text{uniform}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta$.",
          "Step 3: Recall the stream function for a doublet. A doublet of strength $\\mu$ at the origin has a stream function $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta$. For a circular cylinder of radius $R$ to be formed by combining uniform flow and a doublet, the doublet strength is related by $\\mu = 2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2$. Substituting this, $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta$.",
          "Step 4: Combine the uniform flow and doublet stream functions to get the stream function for a non-spinning cylinder. $\\psi_{\\text{cylinder, no circ}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta - V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta$.",
          "Step 5: Recall the stream function for a point vortex. For a counter-clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$, the stream function for a point vortex at the origin is $\\psi_{\\text{vortex}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$. (Note: Sign conventions for the vortex stream function can vary between textbooks; this convention is consistent with the correct option and widely used, e.g., Anderson).",
          "Step 6: Superimpose all three stream functions to get the initial combined stream function: $\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$.",
          "Step 7: Apply the boundary condition that $\\psi = 0$ on the cylinder surface ($r=R$). Evaluate the current stream function at $r=R$: $\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R) = 0 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$.",
          "Step 8: Adjust the stream function to satisfy the boundary condition. Since stream function is defined up to an arbitrary constant, we can subtract $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$ from the entire expression to make $\\psi=0$ at $r=R$. This leads to replacing $\\ln(r)$ with $\\ln(r) - \\ln(R) = \\ln(r/R)$. The final stream function is $\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)$."

This section presents a classic application of this principle, known as the method of superposition, to analyze the flow field around a circular cylinder without generating lift. ... When a uniform flow is superimposed with a doublet oriented to oppose the flow, a unique streamline is formed where the velocity contributions from each flow exactly cancel each other out. This streamline, designated `ψ = 0`, forms a perfect circle. ... By adding the stream function for uniform flow and a doublet, we obtain the stream function for the entire flow field. ... The core idea is that the stream function of a combined flow field is simply the algebraic sum of the stream functions of the individual flows.

          "description": "The complex potential $W(z) = \\phi + i\\psi$ can be used, where $z = r e^{i\\theta}$. The complex potential for uniform flow, doublet, and vortex are added, and then the imaginary part gives the stream function. For a cylinder with circulation, $W(z) = V_{\\text{inf}} \\left(z + \\frac{R^2}{z}\\right) + i \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(z)$.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: More elegant and compact for derivation, naturally handles both potential and stream functions. Cons: Requires familiarity with complex variable theory, which might be less intuitive for some students.",

However, there was a minor sign convention discrepancy for the vortex stream function term compared to the standard textbook (Anderson) which the RAG itself references. The final answer was confirmed by aligning with Anderson's standard formulation. Other RAG chunks were relevant for the non-circulatory part of the flow."
