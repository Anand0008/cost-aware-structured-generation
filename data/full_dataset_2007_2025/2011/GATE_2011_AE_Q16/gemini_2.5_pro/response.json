        "reasoning": "A 'positive yawing manoeuvre' implies the aircraft is actively changing its yaw orientation, which is a dynamic flight condition. The side-slip angle ($\\beta$) is defined as the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal body axis and the oncoming relative wind velocity vector (RAG Chunks 1, 3). While $\\beta = 0$ is the equilibrium condition for straight and level flight (RAG Chunks 1, 3, 5), during a maneuver, $\\beta$ can take various values:\n\n1.  **Coordinated Turn:** In a perfectly coordinated turn, the pilot uses ailerons and rudder such that the aircraft banks into the turn, and the side-slip angle is ideally kept at or very close to zero. The turn is achieved by banking, and the horizontal component of lift provides the centripetal force, minimizing side-slip.\n2.  **Skid:** If there is too much rudder input for the amount of bank (or insufficient bank for the rudder input), the aircraft will 'skid'. In a skid, the nose points towards the inside of the turn, and the relative wind comes from the outside of the turn, resulting in a positive or negative side-slip angle depending on the direction of the turn and the convention (e.g., if turning left, nose points too far left, wind from right, positive $\\beta$).\n3.  **Slip:** If there is too little rudder input for the amount of bank (or too much bank for the rudder input), the aircraft will 'slip'. In a slip, the nose points towards the outside of the turn, and the relative wind comes from the inside of the turn, resulting in a side-slip angle opposite to that of a skid.\n\nSince a 'yawing manoeuvre' encompasses all these possibilities (from perfectly coordinated to uncoordinated), the side-slip angle is not restricted to always being zero, always positive, or always negative. It 'could be any value' depending on the specific execution and coordination of the manoeuvre. Therefore, option D is correct."

          "Step 1: Understand the term 'positive yawing manoeuvre'. This refers to a dynamic condition where the aircraft is changing its yaw attitude, typically involving rudder input and a change in heading. It is not necessarily an equilibrium condition.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of side-slip angle ($\\beta$). It is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal body axis and the relative wind velocity vector in the horizontal plane (RAG Chunks 1, 3). A positive $\\beta$ means the wind comes from the right side of the aircraft (RAG Chunks 1, 3).",
          "Step 3: Consider the side-slip angle in equilibrium flight. For straight and level flight, the equilibrium condition for directional flight is typically $\\beta = 0$ (RAG Chunks 1, 3, 5).",
          "Step 4: Analyze $\\beta$ during a 'manoeuvre'. During a dynamic maneuver like a turn or a yaw, the aircraft is not necessarily in equilibrium. The side-slip angle can vary significantly based on how the maneuver is executed.",
          "Step 5: Differentiate between coordinated and uncoordinated maneuvers. In a perfectly coordinated turn, $\\beta$ is ideally zero. However, in uncoordinated maneuvers (skids or slips), $\\beta$ will be non-zero (either positive or negative).",
          "Step 6: Conclude that since a 'yawing manoeuvre' can be coordinated or uncoordinated, the side-slip angle is not fixed to a single value or sign. It can be zero, positive, or negative, depending on the specific flight condition. Hence, it 'could be any value'."
