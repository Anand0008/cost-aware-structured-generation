        "reasoning": "A positive yawing maneuver involves intentional generation of a positive yawing moment (nose turning left). The sideslip angle (β) depends on the alignment between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the relative wind. In a coordinated turn using ailerons and rudder, sideslip can be zero. In an uncoordinated turn or during rudder-only input, sideslip can be non-zero (positive or negative). Therefore, during such a maneuver, β could be zero, positive, or negative, making 'could be any value' the correct choice."

          "Step 1: Define key terms: Yawing moment (N) is about the aircraft's Z-axis; positive yawing moment causes nose left. Sideslip angle (β) is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the oncoming relative wind; positive when wind comes from the right.",
          "Step 2: Interpret 'positive yawing manoeuvre': The aircraft is actively yawing, likely due to control inputs like rudder deflection or asymmetric thrust, generating a positive yawing moment.",
          "Step 3: Analyze sideslip angle during such a maneuver: In flight dynamics, sideslip angle is not inherently tied to yawing motion. For instance, in a coordinated turn, pilots use aileron and rudder to maintain β ≈ 0. In an uncoordinated turn, β ≠ 0.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate options: Option A (always zero) is false because maneuvers can have sideslip. Option B (never zero) is false because coordinated turns can have zero sideslip. Option C (always negative) is false as β can be positive, negative, or zero. Option D (could be any value) is true as β depends on specific conditions.",
          "Step 5: Conclude based on aircraft maneuver flexibility: Since the sideslip angle is controllable and situation-dependent, it could indeed be any value within physical limits."
