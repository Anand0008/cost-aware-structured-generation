To solve this, we need to use the Euler buckling formula and the yield stress condition. Given the column length of 1.57 m and the material properties (E = 200 GPa, sigma_y = 240 MPa), we can calculate the width (d) of the column that satisfies both the Euler buckling and yield stress criteria. The step-by-step solution provided below confirms that the correct answer range is 5.95 - 6.05 cm."
