This implies that the Euler critical buckling stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{CR,E}}$) must be equal to the material's yield stress ($\\sigma_y$). For a simply supported column, the effective length factor $K=1$. The radius of gyration ($r$) for a square cross-section of width $d$ is $d/\\sqrt{12}$. By equating the Euler buckling stress formula to the yield stress, we can solve for the required slenderness ratio $(L_e/r)$. Substituting the effective length and the expression for $r$ in terms of $d$, the width $d$ can be calculated. The calculated value of approximately 5.998 cm falls within the specified range of 5.95 to 6.05 cm."
