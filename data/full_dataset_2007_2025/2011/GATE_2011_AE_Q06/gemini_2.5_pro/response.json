        "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of non-trivial stress-strain relations, strain-displacement equations, and equations of equilibrium in three-dimensional linear elastic solids. Based on the fundamental principles of continuum mechanics and linear elasticity:\n\n1.  **Stress-Strain Relations (Constitutive Equations)**: For a 3D linear elastic isotropic material, Hooke's Law provides 6 independent stress-strain relations. These relate the 6 independent stress components ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z, \\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{yz}, \\tau_{zx}$) to the 6 independent strain components ($\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\epsilon_z, \\gamma_{xy}, \\gamma_{yz}, \\gamma_{zx}$). Specifically, there are 3 equations for normal strains and 3 for shear strains. (Refer to RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5).\n\n2.  **Strain-Displacement Equations (Kinematic Relations)**: In 3D, there are 3 displacement components ($u, v, w$). The 6 independent strain components are defined in terms of the partial derivatives of these displacements. There are 3 normal strain-displacement relations (e.g., $\\epsilon_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$) and 3 shear strain-displacement relations (e.g., $\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$). Thus, there are 6 strain-displacement equations. (Refer to RAG Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5).\n\n3.  **Equations of Equilibrium**: For a 3D static problem, equilibrium requires the sum of forces in each of the three orthogonal directions (x, y, z) to be zero. These are differential equations relating the partial derivatives of the stress components. There are 3 such equations. (Refer to RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nTherefore, the numbers are 6, 6, and 3, respectively, which corresponds to option C."
