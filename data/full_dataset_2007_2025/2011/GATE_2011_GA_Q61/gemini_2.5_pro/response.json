We test a value from each interval to determine the sign of the expression `$\\frac{y-1}{y+2}$`. \\n   - **Interval 1: `y < -2` (e.g., choose `y = -3`)** \\n     `$\\frac{-3-1}{-3+2} = \\frac{-4}{-1} = 4$`. Since `4 \\not< 0`, this interval is not part of the solution. \\n   - **Interval 2: `-2 < y < 1` (e.g., choose `y = 0`)** \\n     `$\\frac{0-1}{0+2} = \\frac{-1}{2} = -0.5$`. Since `-0.5 < 0`, this interval IS part of the solution. \\n   - **Interval 3: `y > 1` (e.g., choose `y = 2`)** \\n     `$\\frac{2-1}{2+2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$`. Since `0.25 \\not< 0`, this interval is not part of the solution. \\n\\n6. **Conclusion**: The inequality `$\\frac{y-1}{y+2} < 0$` is satisfied only when `$-2 < y < 1$`.
