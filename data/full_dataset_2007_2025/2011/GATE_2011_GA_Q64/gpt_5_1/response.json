Means:\nP: (1+5+1+10+1+10+5)/7 = 33/7 ≈ 4.71\nQ: (5+10+1+10+5+5+10)/7 = 46/7 ≈ 6.57\nR: (1+10+1+1+5+1+1)/7 = 20/7 ≈ 2.86\nS: (10+1+5+1+10+1+1)/7 = 29/7 ≈ 4.14\nThus Q is the most accurate.\nConsistency is measured by how little the scores vary between rounds (smallest spread/variance). Compute variance (or at least compare spreads):\nP ranges 1–10 with frequent jumps; Q also ranges 1–10 but has many 5s and 10s and only one 1; R ranges 1–10 but mostly 1s with one 10 and one 5; S ranges 1–10 with several 1s, two 10s, one 5.\nTo be precise, compute variance using population formula: \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\).\nFor Q (mean 46/7): squared deviations sum ≈ 76.86 → variance ≈ 10.98.\nFor R (mean 20/7): squared deviations sum ≈ 48.86 → variance ≈ 6.98.\nFor P and S, variances are larger than R (they have more mid and high scores mixed). Hence R has the smallest variance and is the most consistent. Therefore, the most accurate is Q and the most consistent is R → option B."
