From the scoring information provided in the image, we can determine the following:\n\n- The most accurate players are those who hit the bull's eye (10 points) the most. This would be players Q and R, as they both scored 10 points in the bull's eye in multiple rounds.\n- The most consistent players are those who scored points in multiple rounds. Looking at the score table, players Q and R have the most consistent scores across the 7 rounds, with points scored in each round.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and most consistent players are Q and R, which matches the correct answer option B."
