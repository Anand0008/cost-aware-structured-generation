'Contempt' means the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath consideration, worthless, or deserving scorn; disregard for something that should be taken into account.\n\nComparing the meanings, 'Deference' (respect, submission) is directly opposite to 'Contempt' (scorn, disrespect, disregard). Therefore, option D is the most nearly opposite in meaning."
