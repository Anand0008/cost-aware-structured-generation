If the burn time $dt$ approaches zero (as in an impulsive launch), the integral also approaches zero, thus minimizing gravity loss.\n2.  **Aerodynamic Drag Loss ($\\Delta V_{drag}$):** This loss is also an integral over the burn time, $\\Delta V_{drag} = \\int \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_d / m dt$. If the burn time $dt$ approaches zero, the time spent traveling through the dense atmosphere at high velocity is negligible, causing the integral to approach zero, thus minimizing drag loss.\n\nTherefore, an impulsive launch minimizes both aerodynamic drag and gravitational forces' impact on burnout velocity."
