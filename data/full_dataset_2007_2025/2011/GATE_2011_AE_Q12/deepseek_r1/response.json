        "reasoning": "An impulsive launch is characterized by an extremely short burn time, where the rocket achieves its final velocity almost instantaneously. Gravity loss ($\\Delta V_{gravity}$) is directly proportional to burn time ($t_b$) for vertical flight ($\\Delta V_{gravity} \\approx g_0 t_b$). A very short $t_b$ minimizes this loss. Drag loss ($\\Delta V_{drag}$) depends on the time spent in the dense atmosphere and the vehicle's velocity. While high initial acceleration can lead to high velocity in dense air, the extremely short duration of the burn drastically reduces the time the vehicle spends in the atmosphere at any significant dynamic pressure, thereby also minimizing the integrated drag loss. Thus, an impulsive launch minimizes losses from both forces. Option D (reaction jet control force) is unrelated to burnout velocity loss minimization."

          "Step 3: Analyze gravity loss. $\\Delta V_{gravity} = \\int_0^{t_b} g \\sin(\\theta) dt$. For a near-vertical initial ascent, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx 1$, so $\\Delta V_{gravity} \\approx g_0 t_b$. A short $t_b$ directly minimizes this loss.",
          "Step 4: Analyze drag loss. $\\Delta V_{drag} = \\int_0^{t_b} \\frac{D}{m} dt = \\int_0^{t_b} \\frac{0.5 \\rho V^2 S C_d}{m} dt$. Although velocity $V$ may become large quickly during an impulsive launch, the integration time $t_b$ is so short that the total integral (area under the curve) is minimized. The rocket also exits the dense lower atmosphere extremely quickly, reducing $\\rho$ during most of the burn.",
          "Step 5: Synthesize. The defining feature of an impulsive launch is minimal burn duration, which reduces the time over which both gravity and drag forces can act, thereby minimizing the velocity losses associated with both.",
