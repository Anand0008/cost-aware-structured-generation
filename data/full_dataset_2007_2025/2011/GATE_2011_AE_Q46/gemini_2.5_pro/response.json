The core components are the bound vortex and the trailing vortices.\n\n*   **Statement P: The bound vortex is responsible for the lift force.** According to the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, lift is directly proportional to the circulation ($\\Gamma$) of the bound vortex (L' = $\\rho U_{\\infty} \\Gamma$). The bound vortex represents the lifting action of the wing. This statement is TRUE.\n\n*   **Statement Q: The trailing vortices are responsible for the induced drag.** The trailing vortices, shed from the wing, induce a downward velocity component (downwash) over the wing. This downwash effectively tilts the local lift vector rearward, creating a component in the direction of drag, which is known as induced drag. This statement is TRUE.\n\n*   **Statement R: The bound vortex is responsible for the induced drag.** The bound vortex is primarily associated with the generation of lift, not induced drag. Induced drag is a consequence of the downwash caused by trailing vortices. This statement is FALSE.\n\n*   **Statement S: The trailing vortices are responsible for the lift force.** Trailing vortices are responsible for downwash and induced drag. The lift force is generated by the bound vortex. This statement is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the combination of true statements is P and Q, which corresponds to option A."
