        "reasoning": "The passage explicitly describes four distinct types of clouds: Nimbus, Stratus, Cirrus, and Cumulus. Option D directly states that these are four basic cloud types. This is the most direct and undeniable inference from the provided text. Options A and B introduce information not present in the passage (fog, ease of weather prediction). Option C, while potentially inferable that clouds have different shapes/sizes based on their descriptions, is a slightly less direct inference than the explicit enumeration of types. The passage directly presents these four as distinct categories, making option D the strongest inference."

          "Step 3: Analyze Option A: 'A cumulus cloud on the ground is called fog'. The passage describes cumulus clouds but makes no mention of fog or clouds on the ground. Therefore, this cannot be inferred from the passage.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Option B: 'It is easy to predict the weather by studying clouds'. The passage describes cloud characteristics but provides no information about weather prediction or its ease. Therefore, this cannot be inferred from the passage.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Option C: 'Clouds are generally of very different shapes, sizes and mass'. The passage describes Nimbus as 'dark and ragged', Stratus as 'dull in colour and cover the entire sky', Cirrus as 'thin and delicate', and Cumulus as 'look like cotton balls'. These descriptions indeed suggest differences in shape and size, and by extension, potentially mass. This is a plausible inference.",
          "Step 6: Analyze Option D: 'There are four basic cloud types: stratus, nimbus, cumulus and cirrus'. The passage explicitly names and describes these four distinct types of clouds. This is a direct enumeration and characterization from the text.",
          "Step 7: Compare the strength of inferences for Options C and D. Option D is a more direct statement of what the passage *presents* (four distinct types). While Option C is also inferable, it requires a slight interpretative step from the descriptive adjectives to 'different shapes, sizes and mass'. In inference questions, the most direct and least ambiguous conclusion is generally preferred.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that Option D is the most direct and strongest inference based solely on the information provided in the passage."
