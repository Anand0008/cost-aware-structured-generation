        "notes": "RAG chunk 2 (Generalized Hooke's Law and Elastic Constants) was highly relevant and provided the core formulas for stress-strain relations and the relationship between E, G, and nu. Chunk 3 also reinforced the elastic constant relationships. Other chunks were less directly applicable but provided context on plane stress/strain."

What are the remaining components of stresses (in MPa) and strains? Assume the material to be isotropic and linear-elastic with Young's modulus E = 200 GPa and Poisson's ratio nu = 1/3."
