        "reasoning": "The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is a simplified model for beam bending that relies on several fundamental assumptions. Key among these are:\n1.  **Plane sections remain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis after bending** (Chunks 1, 4, 5, 6). This implies that shear deformations are negligible.\n2.  **Only the longitudinal normal strain ($\\epsilon_{xx}$) is considered significant**, and all other strain components (transverse normal strains $\\epsilon_{yy}, \\epsilon_{zz}$ and all shear strains $\\gamma_{xy}, \\gamma_{xz}, \\gamma_{yz}$) are neglected or assumed to be zero (Chunks 2, 3).\n3.  **Only the longitudinal normal stress ($\\sigma_{xx}$) is considered significant**, and all other stress components (transverse normal stresses $\\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}$ and all shear stresses $\\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz}$) are considered zero, consistent with Hooke's Law and the strain assumptions (Chunks 2, 3).\n\nLet's analyze this against the definitions of plane stress and plane strain:\n*   **Plane Stress Condition:** A state where stress components normal to a given plane and shear stresses associated with that plane are zero. For a beam, if we consider the x-y plane of bending, this typically means $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$. In Euler-Bernoulli theory, it is assumed that $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$, $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{yz} = 0$ (as all stress components other than $\\sigma_{xx}$ are zero). Thus, the plane stress condition is satisfied.\n*   **Plane Strain Condition:** A state where strain components normal to a given plane and shear strains associated with that plane are zero. For a beam, this typically means $\\epsilon_z = 0$, $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$, $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$. In Euler-Bernoulli theory, it is assumed that $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$, and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$ (as all strain components other than $\\epsilon_{xx}$ are zero). Thus, the plane strain condition is also satisfied.\n\nBecause Euler-Bernoulli theory simplifies the stress and strain states to be essentially uniaxial (only longitudinal normal stress/strain is non-zero), it simultaneously satisfies the conditions for both plane stress and plane strain. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

This information was directly and critically relevant to determining the plane stress/strain conditions and validating the correct answer."
