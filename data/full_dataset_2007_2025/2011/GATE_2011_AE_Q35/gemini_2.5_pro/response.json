          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and the condition. The given parameters are mass flow rate ($\\dot{m} = 200 \\text{ kg/s}$), exhaust velocity ($v_e = 2 \\text{ km/s}$), and gravitational acceleration ($g_0 = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$). The critical condition is 'fully expanded jet', which implies the nozzle exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$).",
          "Step 2: Convert units for consistency. The exhaust velocity is given in km/s, so convert it to m/s: $v_e = 2 \\text{ km/s} = 2000 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "Step 3: Apply the thrust equation for a fully expanded jet. The general thrust equation is $F = \\dot{m} v_e + (P_e - P_a) A_e$. Since $P_e = P_a$ for a fully expanded jet, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ becomes zero. Thus, the thrust simplifies to $F = \\dot{m} v_e$.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the thrust using the simplified formula. Substitute the values: $F = (200 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (2000 \\text{ m/s}) = 400,000 \\text{ N}$. Convert this to kilonewtons: $F = 400 \\text{ kN}$.",
          "Step 5: Apply the specific impulse formula. Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is defined as the effective exhaust velocity divided by the standard gravitational acceleration: $I_{sp} = \\frac{v_e}{g_0}$.",
          "Step 6: Calculate the specific impulse. Substitute the values: $I_{sp} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ m/s}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 203.873598 \\text{ s}$. Round to two decimal places as per options: $I_{sp} \\approx 203.87 \\text{ s}$.",
