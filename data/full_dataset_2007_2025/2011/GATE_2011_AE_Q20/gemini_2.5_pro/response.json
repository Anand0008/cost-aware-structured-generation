        "reasoning": "Winglets are aerodynamic devices specifically designed and implemented at the wingtips of an aircraft. Their primary purpose is to reduce induced drag. Induced drag is a consequence of lift generation on a finite wing, caused by the formation of wingtip vortices. These vortices result from the pressure differential between the high-pressure air below the wing and the low-pressure air above it, which tries to equalize by flowing around the wingtip. Winglets act as a barrier or fence, mitigating the strength and formation of these vortices. By doing so, they effectively increase the wing's aspect ratio or improve its Oswald efficiency factor, leading to a reduction in induced drag. The retrieved knowledge consistently supports this function, stating that winglets reduce induced drag by mitigating wingtip vortices and increasing the effective aspect ratio (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). Other drag types like skin friction drag, profile drag (sum of skin friction and pressure drag), and wave drag (associated with high-speed compressible flow and shock waves) are not the primary targets of winglets (Chunk 5). In fact, adding winglets might slightly increase skin friction drag due to increased wetted area (Chunk 1, 4)."

          "Step 4: Relate wingtip vortices to a specific type of drag. Wingtip vortices are the direct cause of induced drag, which is a 'drag due to lift' specific to finite wings.",
          "Step 5: Consider the other options. Skin friction drag is due to viscous shear stress, profile drag is the sum of skin friction and pressure drag, and wave drag occurs at high speeds due to shock waves. Winglets do not primarily minimize these types of drag; they specifically target induced drag.",
