        "reasoning": "Lift is fundamentally defined as the aerodynamic force component perpendicular to the relative velocity vector (or flight path). When an aircraft is climbing vertically up, its velocity vector is directed purely upwards. Therefore, any force perpendicular to this vertical velocity vector must be horizontal. A conventionally oriented wing, when moving vertically through the air (i.e., with the relative wind parallel to its span), does not generate a significant aerodynamic force component perpendicular to the vertical motion. The primary aerodynamic force generated in this orientation would be drag, acting opposite to the vertical motion. Mathematically, for steady rectilinear flight (which includes a steady climb), the lift (L) is related to the aircraft's weight (W) and the flight path angle ($\\gamma$) by the equation: $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$. For a vertical climb, the flight path angle $\\gamma$ is $90^\\circ$. Substituting this value into the equation: $L = W \\cos(90^\\circ) = W \\times 0 = 0$. Thus, the lift on an aircraft climbing vertically up is zero."
