Therefore, the direction perpendicular to the flight path is horizontal. An aircraft climbing vertically is not generating an aerodynamic force in the horizontal direction (unless it is sideslipping, but the question implies steady, symmetric, vertical climb). The wing's angle of attack relative to the vertical flight path is such that it produces no net horizontal force (lift). The thrust acts along the flight path to overcome weight and drag. Hence, the lift force is zero. The RAG context confirms the fundamental force balance: L = W * cos(gamma). For gamma = 90 degrees (vertical climb), cos(gamma) = 0, leading to L = 0."
