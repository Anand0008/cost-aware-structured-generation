        "reasoning": "The question asks when the pilot uses indicated airspeed, and the correct answer is 'A. take-off'. During takeoff, the pilot relies on the airspeed indicator to monitor the aircraft's speed relative to the surrounding air, which is critical for achieving the correct lift-off speed and rotation. The airspeed indicator provides a direct measure of dynamic pressure, which is the primary driver of lift generation. Therefore, the pilot uses indicated airspeed, not navigation or engine RPM settings, during the takeoff phase of flight."
