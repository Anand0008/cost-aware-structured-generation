    "question_text": "In a particular rocket engine, helium propellant is heated to 6000 K and 95% of its total enthalpy is recovered as kinetic energy of the nozzle exhaust. Consider helium to be a calorically perfect gas with specific heat at constant pressure of 5200 J/kgK. The exhaust velocity for such a rocket for an optimum expansion is _____ m/s."
