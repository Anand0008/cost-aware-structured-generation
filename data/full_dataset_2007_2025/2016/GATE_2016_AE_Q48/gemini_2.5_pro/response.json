The total enthalpy in the combustion chamber, assuming negligible velocity, is given by $h_{0c} = C_p T_c$.

The kinetic energy is also expressed as $\\frac{1}{2} V_e^2$. Equating these two expressions allows us to solve for the exhaust velocity $V_e$. Given $T_c = 6000\\text{ K}$ and $C_p = 5200\\text{ J/kgK}$: \\begin{itemize} \\item Energy balance: $0.95 \\times C_p T_c = \\frac{1}{2} V_e^2$ \\item Rearranging for $V_e$: $V_e = \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.95 \\times C_p T_c}$ \\item Substituting values: $V_e = \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.95 \\times 5200\\text{ J/kgK} \\times 6000\\text{ K}}$ \\item Calculation: $V_e = \\sqrt{59280000}$ \\item Result: $V_e \\approx 7699.35\\text{ m/s}$ \\end{itemize} This calculated value falls within the specified range of $7690 : 7710\\text{ m/s}$."
