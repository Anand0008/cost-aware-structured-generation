        "reasoning": "Across an oblique shock wave, the following changes occur for an ideal gas under adiabatic conditions:\n1.  **Static Pressure ($P$):** Always increases. The flow is compressed, leading to a rise in static pressure. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 1, 5, 6)\n2.  **Static Temperature ($T$):** Always increases. Kinetic energy is converted into internal energy due to compression and dissipation, causing a temperature rise. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 1, 5, 6)\n3.  **Total Temperature ($T_0$):** Remains constant. For an adiabatic flow (no heat transfer) and no shaft work, the total energy of the fluid is conserved, which implies constant total temperature across the shock. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5)\n4.  **Total Pressure ($P_0$):** Always decreases. A shock wave is an irreversible process, which leads to an increase in entropy and a corresponding loss of total pressure. (Confirmed by RAG Chunks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A. Static temperature increases, total temperature remains constant.** This statement is TRUE.\n*   **B. Static pressure increases, static temperature increases.** This statement is TRUE.\n*   **C. Static temperature increases, total pressure decreases.** This statement is TRUE.\n*   **D. Static pressure increases, total temperature decreases.** This statement is FALSE.
