This is because at low subsonic speeds, the turboprop engine can efficiently convert the turbine's shaft power into propeller thrust, which is well-suited for low-speed flight. In contrast, turbojet and turbofan engines are optimized for higher-speed flight, while ramjets require supersonic speeds to operate efficiently. Therefore, the turboprop engine is the most efficient choice for the given low-speed cruise condition."
