        "reasoning": "The correct answer is Turboprop (C). This is based on the fundamental relationship between propulsive efficiency (η_p), flight speed (V_0), and exhaust jet velocity (V_e). At low flight speeds (Mach < 0.5), engines that accelerate a large mass of air by a small velocity increment (low V_e/V_0) achieve the highest η_p. Turboprop engines, which use a propeller to move a large mass of air with a small ΔV, excel in this regime. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2 & 3) explicitly states propeller-driven systems are most efficient at lower speeds, while turbojets and ramjets are optimized for higher speeds. The answer key confirms this."

          "Step 1: Understand the context. The question asks for the engine with the highest propulsive efficiency at a cruising Mach number < 0.5, i.e., low subsonic speeds.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of propulsive efficiency (η_p). For a jet engine, η_p = (Useful propulsive power) / (Rate of addition of kinetic energy to the exhaust stream). An ideal form is η_p = (2 V_0) / (V_e + V_0), where V_0 is flight velocity and V_e is exhaust velocity.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the formula. Propulsive efficiency is maximized when the exhaust velocity (V_e) is as close as possible to the flight velocity (V_0). A low ratio V_e/V_0 leads to high η_p.",
          "Step 4: Relate engine types to exhaust velocity. Different engines produce thrust by handling different air masses and jet velocities: Turboprop moves a very large air mass with a small velocity increase (low V_e). Turbofan moves a large bypass air mass at moderate ΔV. Turbojet moves a smaller core air mass at high V_e. Ramjet, at low speeds, is inefficient or non-functional as it relies on ram compression.",
          "Step 5: Apply to low-speed condition. At Mach < 0.5, V_0 is low. To keep V_e close to V_0, you need an engine with a low designed V_e. Turboprop, with its large propeller, has the lowest effective V_e among the options, thus the highest η_p.",
          "Step 6: Eliminate other options. Ramjet is inefficient or inoperable at such low speeds. Turbojet and turbofan have higher design V_e, making their η_p lower than turboprop at low Mach."
