        "reasoning": "In a plane stress condition for a thin plate, the out-of-plane stresses are taken as zero: $\\sigma_z = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$. However, due to Poisson effect from in-plane normal stresses $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$, the out-of-plane normal strain $\\epsilon_z$ is generally non-zero. Megson and the RAG chunks explicitly state that although $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\epsilon_z = -\\nu/E\\,(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) \\neq 0$ in general. Also, because $\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$ and the plate is free on its surfaces, the corresponding shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$ are taken as zero in the plane stress idealization. Therefore: (a) is true: shear strains along thickness direction (i.e., involving z) are zero, but normal strain along thickness is not zero. (r) correctly explains that this non-zero normal strain arises from Poisson effect due to in-plane stresses. Hence both statements are true and (r) is the correct reason for (a), matching option A."
