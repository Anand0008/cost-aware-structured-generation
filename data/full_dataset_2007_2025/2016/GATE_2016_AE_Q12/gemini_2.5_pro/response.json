        "reasoning": "Statement [a] asserts that in a plane stress problem, shear strains along the thickness direction are zero, but normal strain along the thickness is not zero. This is correct. By definition, in a plane stress state, the stress components perpendicular to the plane (i.e., in the thickness or z-direction) are assumed to be zero: `$\\sigma_z = 0$`, `$\\tau_{xz} = 0$`, `$\\tau_{yz} = 0$`. Since shear stress `$\\tau_{xz}$` and `$\\tau_{yz}$` are zero, the corresponding shear strains `$\\gamma_{xz}$` and `$\\gamma_{yz}$` must also be zero (assuming an isotropic material where shear strain is directly proportional to shear stress). However, the normal strain `$\\epsilon_z$` is generally not zero. This is due to the Poisson effect, where in-plane normal stresses (e.g., `$\\sigma_x$` and `$\\sigma_y$`) cause deformation in the perpendicular (z) direction. The formula for `$\\epsilon_z$` in plane stress is `$\\epsilon_z = -\\frac{\\nu}{E} (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`. Unless `$(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$`, `$\\epsilon_z$` will be non-zero. Therefore, statement [a] is TRUE.\n\nStatement [r] states that in a plane stress problem, the Poisson effect induces the normal strain along the thickness direction of the body. This is also correct and directly explains why `$\\epsilon_z$` is non-zero, as detailed above. The Poisson effect describes the phenomenon where a material deforms in directions perpendicular to the applied load. In plane stress, `$\\sigma_x$` and `$\\sigma_y$` are the applied loads in the plane, and they induce `$\\epsilon_z$` through the Poisson's ratio `$\\nu$`. Therefore, statement [r] is TRUE.\n\nSince statement [r] provides the fundamental reason for the non-zero normal strain component mentioned in statement [a], [r] is the correct reason for [a]. Thus, option A is the correct choice."

          "Step 1: Understand the definition of a plane stress problem. In a plane stress state, it is assumed that the stress components perpendicular to the plane of interest are negligible or zero. If the plane is the xy-plane, then `$\\sigma_z = 0$`, `$\\tau_{xz} = 0$`, and `$\\tau_{yz} = 0$`.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the shear strains along the thickness direction. Since `$\\tau_{xz} = 0$` and `$\\tau_{yz} = 0$` in a plane stress problem, and for an isotropic material, shear strain is proportional to shear stress (`$\\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G}$`), it follows that the shear strains `$\\gamma_{xz}$` and `$\\gamma_{yz}$` are also zero. This confirms the first part of statement [a].",
          "Step 3: Analyze the normal strain along the thickness direction (`$\\epsilon_z$`). Even though `$\\sigma_z = 0$`, the material still deforms in the z-direction due to the stresses acting in the x and y directions. This phenomenon is known as the Poisson effect.",
          "Step 4: Recall the Generalized Hooke's Law for normal strain in the z-direction under plane stress conditions. For `$\\sigma_z = 0$`, the strain `$\\epsilon_z$` is given by `$\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)] = -\\frac{\\nu}{E} (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`. This shows that `$\\epsilon_z$` is generally non-zero unless `$(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$`. This confirms the second part of statement [a].",
          "Step 5: Evaluate statement [r]. Statement [r] explicitly attributes the normal strain along the thickness direction to the Poisson effect. As established in Step 4, this is precisely why `$\\epsilon_z$` is non-zero. Thus, statement [r] is true and provides the correct reason for the non-zero normal strain mentioned in statement [a]."
