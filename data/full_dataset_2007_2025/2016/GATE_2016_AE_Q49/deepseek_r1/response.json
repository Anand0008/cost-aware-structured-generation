        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Interpret the scenario. Aircraft heading north (longitudinal axis aligned with north) with ground speed $U_g=55$ m/s. Crosswind from East to West means wind velocity $v_{cross}=5$ m/s from the East (negative x-direction if East is positive x). The aircraft's air-relative velocity (airspeed) vector is the vector sum of ground velocity and opposite of wind (or equivalently, the relative wind experienced by the aircraft).",
          "Step 2: Determine the sideslip angle $\\beta$. Sideslip is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis (pointing north) and the incoming relative wind. With aircraft heading north, the relative wind has a component from the right (East) because the crosswind is from East to West. In body axes (x forward, y right), $u = U_g = 55$ m/s (north), $v = v_{cross} = 5$ m/s (east). Thus, $\\beta = \\arctan(v/u) = \\arctan(5/55) = \\arctan(1/11) \\approx 5.194^\\circ$. Positive $\\beta$ indicates wind from the right (starboard).",
          "Step 3: Apply the directional trim condition. For steady flight with no net yawing moment, the sum of yaw moments due to sideslip and rudder deflection must be zero: $C_{n_\\beta} \\beta + C_{n_{\\delta_r}} \\delta_r = 0$.",
          "Step 4: Solve for rudder deflection $\\delta_r$. Rearranging: $\\delta_r = -\\frac{C_{n_\\beta} \\beta}{C_{n_{\\delta_r}}}$. Substitute values: $C_{n_\\beta}=0.012$ per degree, $C_{n_{\\delta_r}}=-0.0072$ per degree, $\\beta=5.194^\\circ$. So, $\\delta_r = -\\frac{0.012 \\times 5.194}{-0.0072} = \\frac{0.062328}{0.0072} \\approx 8.657^\\circ$.",
