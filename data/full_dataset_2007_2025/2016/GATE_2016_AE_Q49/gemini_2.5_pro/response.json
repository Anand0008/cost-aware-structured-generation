The solution correctly applies the principle of yawing moment equilibrium for directional trim, balancing the moment due to sideslip with the moment generated by rudder deflection. The sideslip angle is accurately derived from the aircraft's forward velocity and the crosswind velocity. The sign conventions for $C_{n\\beta}$ and $C_{n\\delta_r}$ are handled consistently, resulting in a positive rudder deflection, which is physically appropriate for counteracting a positive sideslip (wind from the right)."

          "Step 4: Apply the directional trim condition. For the aircraft to maintain a steady heading in the crosswind, the net yawing moment about the center of gravity must be zero. This is expressed as: $C_{n\\beta} \\cdot \\beta + C_{n\\delta_r} \\cdot \\delta_r = 0$.",
