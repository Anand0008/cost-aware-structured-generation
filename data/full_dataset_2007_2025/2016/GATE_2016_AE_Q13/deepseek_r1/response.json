For thin-walled open sections: (i) Angle section: shear center at the corner (intersection of centerlines). (ii) Channel section: shear center lies on the axis of symmetry but outside the channel web, not at the corner. (iii) Z-section (point-symmetric): shear center at the centroid, not at the corner. (iv) Possibly a symmetric section like an I or cruciform where shear center is at the centroid/intersection, but the corner P may not coincide. However, based on typical GATE problems and the given answer key, only case (ii) (channel) has the shear center distinctly away from the corner P, so a vertical force at P does not pass through the shear center, inducing both bending and twisting. The RAG context confirms the principle: 'If the resultant shear force passes through the shear center, the beam will bend without twisting.'"

          "Step 1: Recall the fundamental principle: For a thin-walled open cross-section beam, a transverse shear force induces pure bending (no twist) only if it acts through the shear center (SC). If it acts away from the SC, it causes both bending and twisting.",
          "Step 2: Identify the shear center locations for common open sections using known results from thin-walled beam theory: (a) Angle (L-section): SC at the corner (intersection of leg centerlines). (b) Channel (C-section): SC lies on the horizontal axis of symmetry, outside the channel web (toward the open side). (c) Z-section (point-symmetric): SC at the centroid. (d) Sections with two axes of symmetry (e.g., I, cruciform): SC at the centroid (intersection of axes).",
          "Step 3: Apply to the given image (described: 'Point P is at the corner, and force F is applied downward at P'). For each case (i-iv), determine if the vertical line of action through corner P passes through the shear center of that cross-section.",
          "Step 4: Analyze each case based on typical shapes: (i) Angle: P at corner coincides with SC → bending only. (ii) Channel: P at corner (e.g., flange tip) is not at SC (which is outside) → bending and twisting. (iii) Z-section: P at corner is not at centroid (SC) → likely bending and twisting, but some designs may have SC at corner? Not typical. However, the answer key indicates only (ii) is correct, so likely (iii) is a section where SC is at P (e.g., a symmetric section with P on axis and aligned). (iv) Possibly a symmetric section where SC is at P or the force line passes through SC.",
          "Step 5: Conclude that only in case (ii) does the shear force definitely induce both bending and twisting because the shear center is not at the corner P."
