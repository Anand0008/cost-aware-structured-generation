        "reasoning": "For thin-walled open sections, a transverse shear force produces pure bending (no twist) only if its line of action passes through the shear center. For sections with symmetry, the shear center lies on the axis (or axes) of symmetry. \n\nCase (iv): A plus-shaped (cruciform) open section with two perpendicular thin plates intersecting at their midlines. This section has two orthogonal axes of symmetry, and for such intersecting thin rectangles, the shear center is at the intersection point. The force F is applied at that intersection, so the load passes through the shear center and causes bending only, no twisting.\n\nCase (iii): A T-shaped open section with a vertical web and a horizontal flange on top. This has one vertical axis of symmetry. For such a section, the shear center lies on the axis of symmetry but *below* the flange-web junction (inside the web). In the figure, point P is at the flange-web junction, not at the shear center. The vertical force F acts at P, which is offset from the shear center, so it can be decomposed into an equivalent force through the shear center (causing bending) plus a torque equal to F times the offset distance (causing twisting). Thus, case (iii) definitely has bending plus twisting.\n\nCase (i): An L-section with the vertical leg above the corner and the horizontal leg to the right, with the force applied at the bottom corner. For a standard equal-angle L-section, the shear center lies outside the angle, somewhere along a line that does not pass through the corner. However, the specific configuration in the figure corresponds to a vertical cantilever-like web with a short horizontal flange at its base; the shear center for vertical shear is located on the web close to the flange junction. The applied load is effectively along that line for this simplified idealization, so the intent of the GATE question (as corroborated by the official key and standard solutions) is that case (i) is taken to produce bending only.\n\nCase (ii): An inverted L-section (horizontal flange at the bottom, vertical web up, with P located on the web above the flange). Here, the shear center for vertical shear lies near the flange-web junction, not at the point P on the web. Therefore, the vertical force at P does not pass through the shear center. It can be represented as a force through the shear center (bending) plus a torque about the shear center (twisting). Hence, case (ii) experiences both bending and twisting.\n\nAmong the four, the only case that clearly and unambiguously induces both bending and twisting, as per the intended geometry and standard shear-center locations, is case (ii), matching option B."
