        "reasoning": "The shear center is a unique point in the cross-section of a beam. If a transverse shear force is applied through this point, the beam will undergo pure bending without any twisting. If the shear force is applied at any other point, it will create an eccentric load, inducing both bending and a torsional moment (twisting).\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n*   **Case (i) L-section (Angle section):** This section is formed by two intersecting thin rectangles. For such sections, the shear center is located at the intersection point of the centerlines of its constituent elements. In this case, point 'P' is exactly at this intersection. Therefore, the force 'F' acts through the shear center, causing only bending.\n*   **Case (ii) C-section (Channel section):** This section has one axis of symmetry (the horizontal axis passing through the web's centerline). The shear center for a C-section lies on this axis of symmetry, but it is located *outside* the web, typically to the left of the web for the orientation shown. Point 'P' is at the junction of the web and the bottom flange. Since 'P' is not the shear center, the applied force 'F' creates a torsional moment about the shear center in addition to the bending moment. Thus, this case induces both bending and twisting.\n*   **Case (iii) T-section:** This section has one axis of symmetry (the vertical axis). The shear center for a T-section lies on its axis of symmetry, at the intersection of the web and the flange. Point 'P' is at this intersection. Therefore, the force 'F' acts through the shear center, causing only bending.\n*   **Case (iv) Cruciform section (Cross section):** This section has two axes of symmetry (horizontal and vertical). For sections with two axes of symmetry, the shear center coincides with the centroid, which is the intersection point of the two elements. Point 'P' is at this intersection. Therefore, the force 'F' acts through the shear center, causing only bending.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Case (ii) results in both bending and twisting."
