Apply the reduction formula: `I_n = -x^n cos x + n x^(n-1) sin x - n(n-1)I_(n-2)`, where `I_n = integral x^n sin x dx`.\n2. For the given integral, `n = 1`, so the formula becomes: `I_1 = -x cos x + sin x - I_(-1)`.\n3. Evaluate the integral `I_(-1) = -cos x + C`. Applying the limits from 0 to pi, we get `I_(-1) = -cos(pi) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - 1 = 2`.\n4. Substituting this back into the `I_1` formula, we get:\n   `I_1 = -x cos x + sin x - 2`.\n5. Evaluating the definite integral from 0 to pi, we get:\n   `integral_0^pi (x sin x) dx = [(-x cos x + sin x - 2)]_0^pi`.\n6. Evaluating the terms at the limits, we get:\n   `(-pi cos(pi) + sin(pi) - 2) - (0 cos(0) + sin(0) - 2) = (-pi * 0 + 0 - 2) - (0 + 0 - 2) = -2`.\n\nTherefore, the value of the definite integral is -2, which is within the given answer range of 3.13 : 3.15."
