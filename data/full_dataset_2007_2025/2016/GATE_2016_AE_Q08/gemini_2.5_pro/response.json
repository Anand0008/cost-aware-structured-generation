        "reasoning": "The Prandtl number (Pr) is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$) to thermal diffusivity ($\\alpha$). It indicates the relative effectiveness of momentum and energy transport by diffusion in the boundary layer. The relationship between the velocity boundary layer thickness ($\\delta$) and the thermal boundary layer thickness ($\\delta_T$) is directly dependent on the Prandtl number:\n\n*   If $Pr = 1$, momentum and heat diffuse at the same rate, so $\\delta = \\delta_T$.\n*   If $Pr > 1$ (e.g., oils), momentum diffuses faster than heat, so $\\delta > \\delta_T$.\n*   If $Pr < 1$ (e.g., air, Pr $\\approx 0.71$), heat diffuses faster than momentum, so $\\delta < \\delta_T$.\n\nThe question states that air, with a Prandtl number of 0.7, flows over a flat plate. Since $Pr = 0.7 < 1$, it means that thermal diffusion is more dominant than momentum diffusion. Consequently, the region where temperature changes significantly (thermal boundary layer) extends further from the surface than the region where velocity changes significantly (velocity boundary layer). Therefore, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer. Option A is the correct statement."
