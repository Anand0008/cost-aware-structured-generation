Given inlet total temperature T_t1 = 300 K, exit total temperature T_t2 = 430 K, isentropic efficiency η_c = 0.85, and γ = 1.4. First, find the ideal isentropic exit temperature T_t2s using η_c = (T_t2s - T_t1) / (T_t2 - T_t1). Then, use the isentropic relation (T_t2s/T_t1) = (P_t2/P_t1)^((γ-1)/γ) to find the pressure ratio. The calculated ratio is approximately 2.99, which lies within the official GATE answer range of 2.9 to 3.1."

          "Step 1: Identify given data. Total temperature at compressor inlet: T_t1 = 300 K. Total temperature at compressor exit: T_t2 = 430 K. Isentropic efficiency of compressor: η_c = 85% = 0.85. Ratio of specific heats: γ = 1.4.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of total-to-total isentropic efficiency for a compressor. η_c = (Ideal work input) / (Actual work input) = (T_t2s - T_t1) / (T_t2 - T_t1). Here, T_t2s is the ideal exit total temperature after an isentropic compression to the same exit pressure P_t2.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the ideal isentropic exit temperature T_t2s. Rearranging the efficiency formula: T_t2s = T_t1 + η_c * (T_t2 - T_t1) = 300 + 0.85 * (430 - 300) = 300 + 0.85 * 130 = 300 + 110.5 = 410.5 K.",
          "Step 4: Recall the isentropic relation between total temperature and total pressure for a perfect gas with constant γ. For an isentropic process: T_t2s / T_t1 = (P_t2 / P_t1)^((γ-1)/γ), where P_t2/P_t1 is the total pressure ratio (PR) across the compressor.",
          "Step 5: Solve for the pressure ratio (PR). PR = (P_t2 / P_t1) = (T_t2s / T_t1)^(γ/(γ-1)). Substitute values: T_t2s/T_t1 = 410.5/300 = 1.36833. γ/(γ-1) = 1.4/(0.4) = 3.5. Therefore, PR = (1.36833)^3.5.",
          "Step 6: Compute the value. (1.36833)^3.5 = exp(3.5 * ln(1.36833)). ln(1.36833) ≈ 0.313, 3.5 * 0.313 = 1.0955, exp(1.0955) ≈ 2.99. Thus, PR ≈ 2.99, which rounds to 3.0. The GATE answer key accepts values between 2.9 and 3.1."

        "notes": "RAG chunks provided relevant formulas and definitions for compressor isentropic efficiency (Chunks 3, 4, 6) and example calculations (Chunks 1, 4). However, none of the chunks directly solved the exact problem (finding pressure ratio given temperatures and efficiency). The chunks supported the concepts but the specific step-by-step solution was derived from internal knowledge. Chunk 2 discusses polytropic efficiency, which is related but not directly used here."
