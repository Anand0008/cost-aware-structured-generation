        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the total pressure ratio across an axial compressor given its inlet and exit total temperatures, isentropic efficiency, and the ratio of specific heats. The solution involves two main steps: first, using the definition of isentropic efficiency to find the ideal (isentropic) exit total temperature, and second, using the isentropic temperature-pressure relation to determine the total pressure ratio. The calculated value of approximately 3.0 falls within the specified range of 2.9 to 3.1."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. We are given the inlet total temperature ($T_{t1} = 300$ K), the actual exit total temperature ($T_{t2} = 430$ K), the isentropic efficiency of the compressor ($\\eta_c = 0.85$), and the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma = 1.4$).",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of compressor isentropic efficiency. For a compressor, isentropic efficiency is defined as the ratio of the ideal (isentropic) temperature rise to the actual temperature rise for the same pressure ratio. Mathematically, $\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{t2s} - T_{t1}}{T_{t2} - T_{t1}}$, where $T_{t2s}$ is the isentropic exit total temperature.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the isentropic exit total temperature ($T_{t2s}$) using the efficiency formula. Substitute the given values into the efficiency equation: $0.85 = \\frac{T_{t2s} - 300}{430 - 300}$.",
          "Step 4: Solve for $T_{t2s}$. This yields $T_{t2s} - 300 = 0.85 \\times 130 = 110.5$ K, so $T_{t2s} = 300 + 110.5 = 410.5$ K.",
          "Step 5: Recall the isentropic relation between total temperature and total pressure ratio. For an isentropic process, the relation is $\\frac{T_{t2s}}{T_{t1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_{t2}}{P_{t1}}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$, where $\\frac{P_{t2}}{P_{t1}}$ is the total pressure ratio ($r_p$).",
          "Step 6: Substitute the known values into the isentropic relation. We have $\\frac{410.5}{300} = (r_p)^{(1.4-1)/1.4}$.",
          "Step 7: Simplify the exponent and solve for $r_p$. The exponent is $\\frac{0.4}{1.4} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.2857$. So, $1.36833 = (r_p)^{0.2857}$. To find $r_p$, raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{0.2857}$ (or $\\frac{7}{2}$): $r_p = (1.36833)^{7/2} \\approx 2.999$.",
          "Step 8: Round the result to an appropriate number of significant figures or check against the given range. The total pressure ratio is approximately 3.0."
