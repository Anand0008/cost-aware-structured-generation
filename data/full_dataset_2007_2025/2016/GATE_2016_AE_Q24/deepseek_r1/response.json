        "reasoning": "The fundamental kinematic relationship in flight mechanics is: Pitch angle ($\\theta$) = Flight path angle ($\\gamma$) + Angle of attack ($\\alpha$). For these two angles to be equal ($\\theta = \\alpha$), we require $\\gamma = 0$. Flight path angle is defined as the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal. A zero flight path angle ($\\gamma = 0$) corresponds to a constant altitude condition (no climb, no descent). Option A, 'wings level constant altitude flight,' is the standard definition of level flight where $\\gamma = 0$. In climbs ($\\gamma > 0$) and descents ($\\gamma < 0$), $\\theta \\neq \\alpha$. Landing typically involves a descent ($\\gamma < 0$) and a flare maneuver, so $\\theta$ and $\\alpha$ are not equal. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1-3) explicitly defines level unaccelerated flight with $\\gamma = 0$, confirming the condition."
