This is a standard concept in propulsion and thermodynamics. The retrieved knowledge (Chunk 5) explicitly states that in the p-V and T-s diagrams for the ideal gas turbine cycle, process 2-3 (heat addition/combustion) is isobaric. Combustion involves significant heat transfer, so it cannot be adiabatic or isentropic. It occurs at approximately constant pressure in a well-designed gas turbine combustor to facilitate continuous flow, unlike in a piston engine where it is isochoric."
