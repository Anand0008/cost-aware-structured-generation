According to fundamental boundary layer theory and empirical correlations for this specific flow regime, the skin friction coefficient is given by the formula: $C_f = \\frac{1.328}{\\sqrt{Re_c}}$. This formula, explicitly stated in multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (e.g., CHUNK 1, 2, 4, 5), clearly shows that $C_f$ is inversely proportional to the square root of $Re_c$, which can be written as $C_f \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{Re_c}}$.
