        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the statement that is NOT TRUE among the given options for non-singular `n x n` matrices A and B. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A. $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$:** This is a fundamental property of determinants, known as the product rule for determinants. It states that the determinant of a product of two square matrices is equal to the product of their individual determinants. This statement is **TRUE** (supported by RAG Chunk 1 and Chunk 4).\n\n*   **B. $\\det(A+B) = \\det(A) + \\det(B)$:** This statement is generally **FALSE**. The determinant function is not additive. A simple counterexample can illustrate this: Let `A = [[1,0],[0,1]]` and `B = [[1,0],[0,1]]`. Then `det(A) = 1` and `det(B) = 1`. So, `det(A) + det(B) = 1 + 1 = 2`. However, `A+B = [[2,0],[0,2]]`, and `det(A+B) = (2)(2) - (0)(0) = 4`. Since `2 \\neq 4`, the statement `det(A+B) = det(A) + det(B)` is not true. Even if A and B are non-singular, their sum can be singular (e.g., `A = I`, `B = -I`, then `A+B = 0`, `det(A+B) = 0`, but `det(A)+det(B) = 1+1=2`). This property is explicitly highlighted as a common misconception (supported by RAG Chunk 3).\n\n*   **C. $\\det(AA^{-1}) = 1$:** Since A is a non-singular matrix, its inverse `A^{-1}` exists. By definition of the inverse, `A A^{-1} = I_n`, where `I_n` is the `n x n` identity matrix. The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1. Therefore, `det(AA^{-1}) = det(I_n) = 1`. This statement is **TRUE** (supported by RAG Chunk 1 and Chunk 6).\n\n*   **D. $\\det(A^T) = \\det(A)$:** This is another fundamental property of determinants, stating that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose. This statement is **TRUE**.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the statement that is NOT TRUE."

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 3, 4, and 6 were highly relevant, directly supporting the truthfulness of options A, C, and the falseness of B. Specifically, Chunk 1 and 4 confirm the product rule (Option A), Chunk 1 and 6 confirm the inverse property (Option C), and Chunk 3 implicitly supports the non-additivity (Option B) by discussing why non-singular matrices do not form a subspace under addition. The property $\\det(A^T) = \\det(A)$ (Option D) was not explicitly mentioned in the RAG context, so internal knowledge was used for that specific point, but it is a standard property."
