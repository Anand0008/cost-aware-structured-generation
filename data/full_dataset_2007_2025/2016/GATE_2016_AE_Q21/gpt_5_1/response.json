Thus, $\\zeta_{ph}$ is inversely proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio $L/D$. Gliders are designed to have very high $L/D$, so $\\zeta_{ph}$ becomes small, meaning the phugoid is lightly damped. This directly supports option C: 'lift to drag ratio is higher for gliders.' Options A, B, and D are not the governing parameters in the standard phugoid damping expression: being unpowered (A) is only relevant insofar as thrust is neglected in the derivation, but that alone does not explain the *difference* between gliders and powered aircraft; mass (B) cancels out in the derivation; and flight speed (D) also cancels when expressed in terms of $L/D$ and equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the official answer C is physically and mathematically correct."

A higher L/D means less drag for a given lift, so less energy is dissipated per cycle, leading to weaker damping.",
