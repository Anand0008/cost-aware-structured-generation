        "reasoning": "The question states that the damping ratio in phugoid motion for gliders is usually less compared to powered aircraft. This is because gliders have a higher lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) compared to powered aircraft. From the derived formula, the phugoid damping ratio is inversely proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio: $\\zeta_{ph} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\times (L/D)}$. Therefore, a higher L/D (as in the case of gliders) leads to a lower phugoid damping ratio, resulting in lightly damped phugoid oscillations."
