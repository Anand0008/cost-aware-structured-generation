        "reasoning": "The Phugoid damping ratio ($\\zeta_P$) is inversely proportional to the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio (L/D). The simplified formula for Phugoid damping ratio, derived by neglecting $C_{D_u}$ and thrust effects (which is highly relevant for gliders), is $\\zeta_P = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} (L/D)}$. Gliders are specifically designed for efficient unpowered flight, which means they have a very high lift-to-drag ratio to maximize glide range and endurance. A higher L/D ratio directly leads to a lower damping ratio, meaning the phugoid oscillations will persist for a longer time (are lightly damped). Therefore, option C correctly identifies the higher lift-to-drag ratio of gliders as the reason for their lower phugoid damping."

          "Step 1: Understand the Phugoid mode. The Phugoid mode is a long-period oscillation in aircraft longitudinal dynamics, characterized by exchanges between speed and altitude.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for Phugoid damping ratio. The approximate formula for Phugoid damping ratio ($\\zeta_P$), derived under assumptions like neglecting $C_{D_u}$ and thrust effects, is given by $\\zeta_P = \\frac{C_{D_1}}{\\sqrt{2} C_{L_1}}$ or equivalently $\\zeta_P = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} (C_{L_1}/C_{D_1})}$.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the relationship between damping ratio and lift-to-drag ratio. From the formula, it is clear that $\\zeta_P$ is inversely proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D = C_{L_1}/C_{D_1}$). This means a higher $L/D$ ratio results in a lower damping ratio, and vice-versa.",
          "Step 4: Consider the characteristics of gliders. Gliders are unpowered aircraft designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency, which translates to a very high lift-to-drag ratio. This high $L/D$ allows them to sustain flight for long durations and cover significant distances without engine power.",
          "Step 5: Apply the relationship to gliders. Since gliders have a significantly higher $L/D$ ratio compared to most powered aircraft (which prioritize thrust and payload over maximum $L/D$), their Phugoid damping ratio will be lower according to the inverse relationship. This results in lightly damped phugoid oscillations for gliders.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the given options. Option C directly states that the lift-to-drag ratio is higher for gliders, which is the direct cause for their lower phugoid damping ratio based on the derived formula."
