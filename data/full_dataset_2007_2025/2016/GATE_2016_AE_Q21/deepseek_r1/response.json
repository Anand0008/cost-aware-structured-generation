This shows $\\zeta_P$ is inversely proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D). Gliders are designed for aerodynamic efficiency and have a significantly higher L/D ratio compared to typical powered aircraft. Therefore, a higher L/D leads to a lower damping ratio, making the phugoid oscillation less damped (more persistent). Options A, B, and D are secondary characteristics; the direct and fundamental reason is the higher L/D."

          "Step 4: Apply the formula to the comparison. Since gliders have a higher L/D, their phugoid damping ratio $\\zeta_P$ is lower (less damped) than that of powered aircraft.",
