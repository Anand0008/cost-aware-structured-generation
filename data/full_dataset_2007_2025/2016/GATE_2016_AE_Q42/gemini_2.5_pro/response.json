The biharmonic equation in Cartesian coordinates is given by `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`, which expands to `$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4} + 2 \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial y^4} = 0$`. By systematically calculating each of these fourth-order partial derivatives for the given `$\\phi$` function and substituting them into the biharmonic equation, we can solve for the unknown coefficient `E`.

        "notes": "RAG chunks 2, 5, and 6 provided excellent and direct information on the Airy's stress function and the biharmonic equation in Cartesian coordinates, including its expanded form, which was crucial for solving this problem. Chunks 1 and 3, while focusing on polar coordinates, reinforced the general concept of Airy's function and compatibility. Chunk 4 was less directly relevant but still discussed the biharmonic equation for axisymmetric problems. Overall, the RAG context was highly relevant and helpful."

The Airy’s stress function will satisfy the equilibrium and the compatibility requirements if and only if the value of the coefficient E is ____."
