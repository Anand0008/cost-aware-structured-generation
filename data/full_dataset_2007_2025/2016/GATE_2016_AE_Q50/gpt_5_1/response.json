Maximum thrust is 5000 N, thrust required for level flight at 100 m/s is 1000 N. The excess thrust available for climb is therefore 4000 N. At constant speed, the rate of climb is given by excess power divided by weight: $R_C = (T_A - T_R)V/W$. Substituting $T_A - T_R = 4000\\,\\text{N}$, $V = 100\\,\\text{m/s}$, $W = 10000\\,\\text{N}$ gives $R_C = 4000\\times 100/10000 = 40\\,\\text{m/s}$.

Additional RAG chunks on thrust/power curves and cruise performance were conceptually related but not strictly necessary. Overall, RAG was helpful but the problem could also be solved from standard internal knowledge."
