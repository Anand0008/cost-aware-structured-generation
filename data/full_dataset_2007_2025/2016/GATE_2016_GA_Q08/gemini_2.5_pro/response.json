The phrase 'in line with IITs' implies a similar model, standard, or objective, but it does not imply a direct affiliation for degree granting. This cannot be logically inferred.\n(ii) 'SITs will have a distinct national objective.' The statement explicitly says SITs are proposed 'to cater to the technological and industrial needs of a developing country.' This directly implies a national objective. This can be logically inferred.\n(iii) 'SIT like institutions can only be established in consultation with IIT.' Similar to (i), 'in line with IITs' suggests following a similar structure or standard, but it does not imply a mandatory consultation or approval process from IITs for establishment. This cannot be logically inferred.\n(iv) 'SITs will serve technological needs of a developing country.' The statement clearly states SITs are proposed 'to cater to the technological and industrial needs of a developing country.' This is a direct restatement of the purpose and is a logical inference.\n\nTherefore, only inferences (ii) and (iv) are logically correct, making option C the correct answer."

          "Step 2: Analyze inference (i) - 'In the initial years, SIT students will get degrees from IIT.' The phrase 'in line with IITs' suggests a similar model or standard, not necessarily a direct affiliation for degree issuance. There is no information in the statement to support this claim. Hence, (i) is not a logical inference.",
          "Step 3: Analyze inference (ii) - 'SITs will have a distinct national objective.' The statement explicitly mentions that SITs are proposed 'to cater to the technological and industrial needs of a developing country.' This directly implies that SITs will have a national objective focused on the country's development. Hence, (ii) is a logical inference.",
          "Step 4: Analyze inference (iii) - 'SIT like institutions can only be established in consultation with IIT.' The phrase 'in line with IITs' refers to adopting a similar framework or quality, not a requirement for consultation or permission from IITs for establishment. This is an over-inference. Hence, (iii) is not a logical inference.",
          "Step 5: Analyze inference (iv) - 'SITs will serve technological needs of a developing country.' The statement clearly states that the purpose of SITs is 'to cater to the technological and industrial needs of a developing country.' This is a direct and undeniable inference from the given text. Hence, (iv) is a logical inference.",
          "Step 6: Identify the option that includes all valid inferences. Based on the analysis, only (ii) and (iv) are logically inferred. Therefore, option C is the correct choice."
