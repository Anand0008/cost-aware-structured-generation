The initial conditions are $y(0) = 1$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=0} = 1$.\n\nStep 1: Formulate the characteristic equation.\nFor an ODE of the form $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$, the characteristic equation is $am^2 + bm + c = 0$.\nHere, $a=1$, $b=-4$, $c=4$. So, the characteristic equation is $m^2 - 4m + 4 = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Solve the characteristic equation.\nThe equation can be factored as $(m-2)^2 = 0$. This yields a repeated real root $m = 2$.\n\nStep 3: Write the general solution.\nFor repeated real roots $m$, the general solution is $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^{mx}$.\nSubstituting $m=2$, we get $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^{2x}$.\n\nStep 4: Apply the first initial condition $y(0) = 1$.\n$1 = (C_1 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^{2 \\cdot 0}$\n$1 = (C_1 + 0)e^0$\n$1 = C_1 \\cdot 1 \\implies C_1 = 1$.\n\nStep 5: Differentiate the general solution to find $\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nSubstitute $C_1=1$ into the general solution: $y(x) = (1 + C_2x)e^{2x}$.\nUsing the product rule, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(1 + C_2x)e^{2x} + (1 + C_2x)\\frac{d}{dx}(e^{2x})$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = C_2e^{2x} + (1 + C_2x)(2e^{2x})$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{2x}(C_2 + 2(1 + C_2x))$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{2x}(C_2 + 2 + 2C_2x)$.\n\nStep 6: Apply the second initial condition $\\frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=0} = 1$.\n$1 = e^{2 \\cdot 0}(C_2 + 2 + 2C_2 \\cdot 0)$\n$1 = 1(C_2 + 2 + 0)$\n$1 = C_2 + 2 \\implies C_2 = 1 - 2 \\implies C_2 = -1$.\n\nStep 7: Write the particular solution.\nSubstitute $C_1=1$ and $C_2=-1$ into the general solution:\n$y(x) = (1 - x)e^{2x}$.\n\nStep 8: Evaluate $y$ at $x=1$.\n$y(1) = (1 - 1)e^{2 \\cdot 1}$\n$y(1) = (0)e^2$\n$y(1) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ at $x=1$ is 0."

They correctly identified the general form of the ODE and the distinction between homogeneous/non-homogeneous. However, the RAG did not explicitly detail the specific solution method for homogeneous ODEs with repeated roots, which was the core mathematical technique required to solve this problem. It provided context but not the direct solution algorithm for this specific root type."
