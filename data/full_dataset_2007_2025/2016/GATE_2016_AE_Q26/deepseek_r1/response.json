Using γ=1.4, R=287 J/kgK, T_core=580 K, T_bypass=295 K, V0=200 m/s, β=6, we get V_e_core≈482.75 m/s, V_e_bypass≈344.29 m/s, numerator≈1148.5 m/s, denominator=7, result≈164.1 Ns/kg. This matches the answer key range 162-166 Ns/kg. The assumption of ideally expanded nozzles (p_e = p_a) is implicit as ambient pressure is not given; pressure thrust terms are neglected.

The core and the bypass nozzles of the engine, that are both convergent nozzles, operate under choked condition and have exhaust static temperatures of 580 K and 295 K, respectively. The specific gas constant and the ratio of specific heats for both the streams are 287 J/kgK and 1.4, respectively. If the fuel-air ratio is negligible, the thrust per unit mass flow rate generated by the engine is _______ Ns/kg."
