        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the thrust per unit mass flow rate (specific thrust) of an un-mixed turbofan engine. The total specific thrust is the weighted average of the specific thrust from the core and bypass streams, weighted by their respective mass flow rates. The key steps are:\n1.  **Calculate exit velocities for both streams**: Since both nozzles are convergent and operate under choked conditions, their exit Mach number is 1. The exit velocity ($V_e$) is equal to the speed of sound ($a_e$) at the exit, given by $a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.\n    *   For the core stream: $V_{e,core} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 580} \\approx 483.73$ m/s.\n    *   For the bypass stream: $V_{e,bypass} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 295} \\approx 344.32$ m/s.\n2.  **Apply the specific thrust formula**: For an un-mixed turbofan with negligible fuel-air ratio ($f \\approx 0$) and neglecting pressure thrust (a common simplification in GATE for 'thrust per unit mass flow rate' unless exit area and pressure difference are explicitly provided or required), the specific thrust ($F_s$) is given by:\n    $F_s = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{core}(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\dot{m}_{bypass}(V_{e,bypass} - V_0)}{\\dot{m}_{core} + \\dot{m}_{bypass}}$\n    Using the bypass ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{bypass}}{\\dot{m}_{core}}$, we can rewrite this as:\n    $F_s = \\frac{(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\alpha (V_{e,bypass} - V_0)}{1 + \\alpha}$\n3.  **Substitute the values**: Given $V_0 = 200$ m/s and $\\alpha = 6.0$.\n    $F_s = \\frac{(483.73 - 200) + 6 \\times (344.32 - 200)}{1 + 6}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{283.73 + 6 \\times 144.32}{7}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{283.73 + 865.92}{7}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{1149.65}{7} \\approx 164.24$ Ns/kg.\n\nThe calculated value of $164.24$ Ns/kg falls within the provided answer key range of $162 : 166$. The second range in the answer key ($1147.0 : 1150.0$) is likely a typo, as it is too high for specific thrust in Ns/kg."

Note that the fuel-air ratio is negligible.",
          "Step 2: Understand the choked nozzle condition. For a convergent nozzle operating under choked conditions, the exit Mach number ($M_e$) is 1. Therefore, the exit velocity ($V_e$) is equal to the speed of sound ($a_e$) at the nozzle exit.",
          "Step 3: Calculate the speed of sound at the exit for both the core and bypass streams using the formula $a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$. This directly gives the exit velocities $V_{e,core}$ and $V_{e,bypass}$.",
          "Step 4: Formulate the total thrust ($F_{total}$) for an un-mixed turbofan. Since the fuel-air ratio is negligible and we are calculating 'thrust per unit mass flow rate', we typically consider only the momentum thrust terms. The pressure thrust term $A_e(P_e - P_a)$ is often neglected in such problems unless specific exit area or pressure data is provided. Thus, $F_{total} = \\dot{m}_{core}(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\dot{m}_{bypass}(V_{e,bypass} - V_0)$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the specific thrust ($F_s$), which is the total thrust divided by the total air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_{core} + \\dot{m}_{bypass}$). Use the bypass ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{bypass}}{\\dot{m}_{core}}$ to simplify the expression for specific thrust to $F_s = \\frac{(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\alpha (V_{e,bypass} - V_0)}{1 + \\alpha}$.",

Specifically, Chunk 4 and 6 directly provided the thrust equation structure, and Chunk 1 provided context for turbofan cycle analysis. Chunk 2 was less directly applicable but contained useful information on choked nozzle conditions and exit velocity calculation, which is a prerequisite. The RAG context was sufficient for solving the problem."

The core and the bypass nozzles of the engine, that are both convergent nozzles, operate under choked condition and have exhaust static temperatures of 580 K and 295 K, respectively. The specific gas constant and the ratio of specific heats for both the streams are 287 J/kgK and 1.4, respectively. If the fuel-air ratio is negligible, the thrust per unit mass flow rate generated by the engine is _______ Ns/kg."
