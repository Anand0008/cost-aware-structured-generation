        "reasoning": "The load factor (n) is defined as the ratio of lift (L) to weight (W), i.e., $n = L/W$. In a steady, level turn, the lift generated by the aircraft is greater than its weight, as the lift vector must provide both the vertical component to balance weight and the horizontal component for the centripetal force required for the turn. Therefore, $L = nW$. In straight and level flight, the lift simply balances the weight, so $L_{level} = W$. The general lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. The problem states that the aircraft is turning at a constant altitude (implying constant air density $\\rho$) and at the same speed (V). The wing area (S) is also constant for the same aircraft. Thus, for a given speed and altitude, lift is directly proportional to the coefficient of lift ($L \\propto C_L$).\n\n1.  **For straight and level flight:**\n    $L_{level} = W$\n    $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_{L,level}$\n    So, $C_{L,level} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}$\n\n2.  **For turning flight:**\n    Given load factor $n = 2$.\n    $L_{turn} = nW = 2W$\n    $2W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_{L,turn}$\n    So, $C_{L,turn} = \\frac{4W}{\\rho V^2 S}$\n\n3.  **Comparing the lift coefficients:**\n    $\\frac{C_{L,turn}}{C_{L,level}} = \\frac{\\frac{4W}{\\rho V^2 S}}{\\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n\n    Therefore, $C_{L,turn} = 2 \\times C_{L,level}$. The coefficient of lift required for turning flight is double that for level flight at the same speed and altitude. This matches option C."
