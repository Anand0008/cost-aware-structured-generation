From the formulas derived in the retrieved knowledge, the relationship between load factor (n) and the bank angle (φ) is n = 1/cos(φ).

Substituting the bank angle of 60°, we get CL = 2W/[0.5ρV^2S], which is double the lift coefficient required for level flight at the same speed. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Double."
