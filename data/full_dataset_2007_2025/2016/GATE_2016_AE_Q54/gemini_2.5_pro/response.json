While it didn't explicitly provide the combined formula for burnout velocity with gravity loss, it strongly hinted at the importance of gravity losses (Chunks 2, 6), which was crucial for correctly interpreting the question and solving it. The RAG context was highly relevant and helpful in confirming the core formula and the conceptual need to consider losses."
