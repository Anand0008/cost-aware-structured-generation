The ideal Tsiolkovsky rocket equation gives the velocity gain due to thrust only: \\(\\Delta V_{\\text{ideal}} = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_i}{M_f}\\right)\\). Here, \\(M_i = 10000\\,\\text{kg}\\), propellant mass is 8400 kg, so \\(M_f = 1600\\,\\text{kg}\\). Thus, \\(\\ln(M_i/M_f) = \\ln(10000/1600) = \\ln(6.25) \\approx 1.8326\\). With \\(g_0 = 9.81\\,\\text{m/s}^2\\) and \\(I_{sp} = 240\\,\\text{s}\\), \\(\\Delta V_{\\text{ideal}} = 9.81 \\times 240 \\times 1.8326 \\approx 4314.6\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Burn time is \\(t_b = \\frac{8400}{1200} = 7\\,\\text{s}\\). Gravity loss during powered vertical flight is \\(g_0 t_b = 9.81 \\times 7 \\approx 68.67\\,\\text{m/s}\\).

Rearrange to express \\(dV\\) in terms of \\(dM\\) and integrate from \\(M_i\\) to \\(M_f\\), while also integrating the gravity term over burn time. This yields \\(V_b = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln(M_i/M_f) - g_0 t_b\\) explicitly.",
