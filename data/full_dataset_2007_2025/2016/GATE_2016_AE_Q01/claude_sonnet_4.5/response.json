This is because thicker airfoils cause greater flow acceleration, leading to sonic flow conditions at lower freestream Mach numbers. The key principle is that thinner airfoils have higher $M_{cr}$ values since they induce smaller flow accelerations. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 'With increase in airfoil thickness, the critical Mach number for an airfoil is likely to decrease.'"
