        "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is defined as the freestream Mach number at which the local Mach number at any point on the airfoil surface first reaches unity (sonic speed, M=1). Thicker airfoils, due to their greater curvature, induce more significant local flow acceleration over their surfaces compared to thinner airfoils. This increased acceleration means that the local flow will reach sonic conditions at a lower freestream Mach number. Therefore, an increase in airfoil thickness leads to a decrease in the critical Mach number. This principle is a fundamental concept in high-speed aerodynamics, as confirmed by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 5)."

Therefore, an increase in airfoil thickness leads to a decrease in the critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$). Conversely, thinner airfoils have higher $M_{cr}$ values."
