A thicker airfoil has a larger curvature, causing greater flow acceleration over its upper surface. This higher local velocity means the local Mach number reaches 1 at a lower freestream Mach number. Therefore, increasing thickness decreases $M_{cr}$. This direct relationship is a standard concept in transonic aerodynamics, clearly stated in the RAG context (e.g., Chunk 1: 'Thinner airfoils generally have higher $M_{cr}$ values because they induce smaller flow accelerations')."
