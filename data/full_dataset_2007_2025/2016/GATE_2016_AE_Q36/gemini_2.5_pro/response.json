        "notes": "RAG chunks provided excellent conceptual definitions and theoretical background for systems of linear equations, consistency, and geometric interpretations (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6). They reinforced the conditions for unique, infinite, and no solutions based on rank. While the RAG did not provide a step-by-step Gaussian elimination example for 'no solution', it provided the necessary theoretical framework to understand the outcome of such a calculation. Chunk 2, while relevant to non-equivalence, was less directly applicable to the solution method itself."
