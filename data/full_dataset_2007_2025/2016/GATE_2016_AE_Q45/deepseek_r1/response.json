Convection: $q = h (T_g - T_{wg})$, where $T_g = 3000$ K, $h = 160$ W/m²K, and $T_{wg}$ is the hot-side wall temperature (unknown). Conduction: $q = \\frac{k}{t} (T_{wg} - T_{wc})$, where $k = 40$ W/mK, $t = 0.005$ m, and $T_{wc} = 500$ K (cold-side temperature).",

        "notes": "RAG provided excellent examples of combined convection and conduction heat transfer in rocket nozzle cooling (Chunks 1, 2, 4, 6). The physics is identical to this problem, though the boundary condition differs (coolant convection vs. fixed cold-side temperature). The worked examples in Chunks 1 and 6 directly illustrate the same equation setup. Thus, RAG was highly relevant and provided solid reference."

The wall thermal conductivity is 40 W/mK. If the colder side of the wall is held at 500 K, the temperature of the side exposed to the hot gas is _______ K."
