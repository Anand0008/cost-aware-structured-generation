        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the process that results in the highest rise in temperature ($\\Delta T$) for a given positive entropy change ($\\Delta s > 0$) in a quasi-steady process. We analyze each option, assuming the substance behaves as an ideal gas, which is a common assumption in GATE Thermodynamics unless specified otherwise.\n\n1.  **Isothermal Process (Option D):** By definition, an isothermal process occurs at constant temperature, meaning $\\Delta T = 0$. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.\n\n2.  **Isenthalpic Process (Option A):** An isenthalpic process occurs at constant enthalpy, meaning $\\Delta H = 0$. For an ideal gas, enthalpy is solely a function of temperature ($H = f(T)$), specifically $\\Delta H = c_p \\Delta T$. If $\\Delta H = 0$, then $c_p \\Delta T = 0$, which implies $\\Delta T = 0$ (since $c_p \\neq 0$). Therefore, this also cannot be the answer.\n\n3.  **Isobaric Process (Option B):** An isobaric process occurs at constant pressure ($\\Delta P = 0$). The entropy change for an ideal gas is given by the relation:\n    $\\Delta s = c_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)$\n    Since $p_2 = p_1$ for an isobaric process, the second term becomes zero ($R \\ln(1) = 0$).\n    So, for an isobaric process: $\\Delta s = c_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)$\n    Rearranging for the temperature ratio: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$\n\n4.  **Isochoric Process (Option C):** An isochoric process occurs at constant volume ($\\Delta V = 0$). The entropy change for an ideal gas is given by the relation:\n    $\\Delta s = c_v \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) + R \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_2}{v_1}\\right)$\n    Since $v_2 = v_1$ for an isochoric process, the second term becomes zero ($R \\ln(1) = 0$).\n    So, for an isochoric process: $\\Delta s = c_v \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)$\n    Rearranging for the temperature ratio: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}$\n\n**Comparison:**\nWe need to compare the temperature rise for the isobaric and isochoric processes for a given $\\Delta s > 0$. We have:\n*   For isobaric: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$\n*   For isochoric: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}$\n\nFor any ideal gas, the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) is always greater than the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$). This is given by Mayer's relation: $c_p = c_v + R$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant and is always positive. Therefore, $c_p > c_v$.\n\nSince $c_p > c_v$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{c_v} > \\frac{1}{c_p}$.\n\nMultiplying by the positive entropy change $\\Delta s$, we get:\n$\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v} > \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$\n\nThis implies that $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isochoric} > \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isobaric}$.\n\nSince the natural logarithm function is monotonically increasing, a larger logarithm value corresponds to a larger argument. Therefore:\n$\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isochoric} > \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isobaric}$\n\nFor a given initial temperature $T_1$, a higher ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$ means a higher final temperature $T_2$, and consequently, a higher temperature rise $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$.\n\nThus, the rise in temperature is highest for the isochoric process."

          "   *   **Isenthalpic process:** Enthalpy remains constant ($\\Delta H = 0$). For an ideal gas, enthalpy is directly proportional to temperature ($\\Delta H = c_p \\Delta T$). Therefore, if $\\Delta H = 0$, then $\\Delta T = 0$. This also cannot be the answer.",
          "**Step 3: Focus on Isobaric and Isochoric Processes.** Since isothermal and isenthalpic processes result in no temperature change for an ideal gas, the answer must be either isobaric or isochoric.",
          "**Step 4: Write the Entropy Change Equation for an Isobaric Process.** For an ideal gas undergoing an isobaric (constant pressure, $\\Delta p = 0$) process, the entropy change is given by: $\\Delta s = c_p \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)$. From this, we can write $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$.",
          "**Step 5: Write the Entropy Change Equation for an Isochoric Process.** For an ideal gas undergoing an isochoric (constant volume, $\\Delta v = 0$) process, the entropy change is given by: $\\Delta s = c_v \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)$. From this, we can write $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}$.",
          "**Step 6: Compare the Temperature Ratios.** We need to compare $\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$ (for isobaric) and $\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}$ (for isochoric). We know that for an ideal gas, the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) is always greater than the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$), i.e., $c_p > c_v$. This is because $c_p = c_v + R$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant and is positive.",
          "**Step 7: Conclude the Process with the Highest Temperature Rise.** Since $c_p > c_v$, it implies that $\\frac{1}{c_v} > \\frac{1}{c_p}$. Therefore, for the same positive entropy change $\\Delta s$, the term $\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}$ will be greater than $\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}$. This means $\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isochoric} > \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isobaric}$. Since the natural logarithm is an increasing function, a larger logarithm implies a larger argument. Hence, $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isochoric} > \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{isobaric}$. This indicates that for a given initial temperature $T_1$ and entropy change $\\Delta s$, the final temperature $T_2$ (and thus the temperature rise $\\Delta T$) is highest for the isochoric process."
