        "reasoning": "We are told a substance undergoes a quasi-steady process with a specified positive entropy change \\(\\Delta s > 0\\). We must compare four possible types of processes (isenthalpic, isobaric, isochoric, isothermal) and determine for which one the associated temperature rise is maximum for the same \\(\\Delta s\\).\n\nAssume a simple compressible system, e.g., an ideal gas or a typical fluid where standard relations apply:\n\n1. **Isothermal (D)**: By definition, \\(T = \\text{const}\\), so the temperature rise is zero. This cannot give the highest temperature rise when \\(\\Delta s > 0\\).\n\n2. **Isenthalpic (A)**: For many substances (e.g., ideal gas), enthalpy depends mainly on temperature, \\(h = c_p T\\). An isenthalpic process then implies \\(T = \\text{const}\\) (for ideal gas), so again essentially no temperature rise. Even for real gases, Joule–Thomson effects give only modest temperature changes for a given entropy change compared to isochoric heating.\n\n3. **Isobaric (B)**: At constant pressure, for an ideal gas, the entropy change is\n\\[ \\Delta s = c_p \\ln \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\]\n(ignoring composition changes). For a given \\(\\Delta s\\), the temperature ratio is\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}\\right). \\]\n\n4. **Isochoric (C)**: At constant volume, the entropy change is\n\\[ \\Delta s = c_v \\ln \\frac{T_2}{T_1}. \\]\nThus,\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}\\right). \\]\n\nFor a typical gas, \\(c_p > c_v\\). For the same positive \\(\\Delta s\\), the exponent \\(\\Delta s / c_v\\) is larger than \\(\\Delta s / c_p\\), so\n\\[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_v}\\right) > \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta s}{c_p}\\right) \\implies \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{\\text{isochoric}} > \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)_{\\text{isobaric}}. \\]\nTherefore, the same entropy increase produces a larger temperature rise in an isochoric process than in an isobaric one.\n\nComparing all four: isothermal gives zero rise; isenthalpic (for ideal gas) gives zero; isobaric gives some rise; isochoric gives the largest rise. Hence, option C (isochoric) is correct and matches the official key."
