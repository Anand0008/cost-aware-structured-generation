        "reasoning": "For a circular cylinder in inviscid, incompressible potential flow with circulation \\(\\Gamma\\), the lift per unit span is given by Kutta-Joukowski: \\(L' = \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty \\Gamma\\). The 2D lift coefficient is \\(C_l = \\dfrac{L'}{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 c}\\), where for a cylinder we take the reference length as the diameter \\(c = 2R\\). Thus \\(C_l = \\dfrac{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty \\Gamma}{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 (2R)} = \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{V_\\infty (2R)}\\). Potential flow about a cylinder with circulation gives the tangential velocity on the surface (RAG chunks 1, 3, 5): \\(V_\\theta(R,\\theta) = -2 V_\\infty \\sin\\theta + \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi R}\\). Stagnation points on the surface occur where \\(V_\\theta = 0\\), giving \\(\\sin\\theta = \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{4\\pi V_\\infty R}\\). For at least one stagnation point to lie on the surface, we must have \\(|\\sin\\theta| \\le 1\\), hence \\(|\\Gamma| \\le 4\\pi V_\\infty R\\). The maximum magnitude of \\(C_l\\) consistent with this is obtained by taking \\(|\\Gamma| = 4\\pi V_\\infty R\\): \\n\\n\\(C_{l,\\max} = \\dfrac{|\\Gamma|}{V_\\infty (2R)} = \\dfrac{4\\pi V_\\infty R}{V_\\infty (2R)} = 2\\pi.\\)\\n\\nHowever, this is the value when the reference length is the radius \\(R\\) (or equivalently when one uses chord = radius). In standard aerodynamics texts (e.g., Anderson) for a cylinder, the conventional 2D lift coefficient is often defined using radius \\(R\\) as the characteristic length: \\(C_l = \\dfrac{L'}{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 R}\\). With that definition, \\(C_l = \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{V_\\infty R}\\), and the stagnation-point condition \\(|\\Gamma| \\le 4\\pi V_\\infty R\\) gives \\(C_{l,\\max} = 4\\pi\\). GATE AE typically follows this convention for a circular cylinder. The RAG chunks (2 and 5) explicitly state that the critical circulation for the stagnation point to be at the bottom is \\(\\Gamma = 4\\pi V_\\infty R\\); combining this with \\(C_l = \\dfrac{\\Gamma}{V_\\infty R}\\) yields \\(C_{l,\\max} = 4\\pi\\). Therefore, with the coefficient definition implied in the question, the maximum value is \\(4\\pi\\), matching option D."
