This is because the tangential velocity on the cylinder surface is given by $V_\\theta = -2 * V_\\infty * \\sin(\\theta) + \\Gamma / (2\\pi R)$. When the circulation $\\Gamma$ is such that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\Gamma / (4\\pi V_\\infty R)$, the tangential velocity becomes zero at two points on the cylinder surface, indicating the presence of stagnation points. The maximum value of $\\sin(\\theta)$ is 1, which occurs when $\\Gamma = 4\\pi V_\\infty R$. Substituting this into the lift formula $L = \\rho V_\\infty^2 \\Gamma$, we get $C_l = 4\\pi$, which is the maximum lift coefficient predicted by potential flow theory."
