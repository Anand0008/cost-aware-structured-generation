Substituting: A2/A1 = 1/10 = 0.1, so 1 - (0.1)² = 0.99. Thus V2 = √[2*1000 / (1.23*0.99)] = √(2000 / 1.2177) ≈ √1642.77 ≈ 40.53 m/s. This falls within the official answer range 40.0–41.0 m/s."

    "question_text": "The nozzle AB, as shown below, leading to the test section of a low speed subsonic wind tunnel, has a contraction ratio of 10:1. The pressure difference across the nozzle is maintained at 1000 N/m^2 and the density of air is 1.23 kg/m^3. Assuming one-dimensional, steady, inviscid flow, the velocity in the test section as measured at point B is ___________ m/s."
