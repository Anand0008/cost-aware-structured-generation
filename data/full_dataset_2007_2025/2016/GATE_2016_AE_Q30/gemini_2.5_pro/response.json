    "question_text": "The nozzle AB, as shown below, leading to the test section of a low speed subsonic wind tunnel, has a contraction ratio of 10:1. The pressure difference across the nozzle is maintained at 1000 N/m^2 and the density of air is 1.23 kg/m^3. Assuming one-dimensional, steady, inviscid flow, the velocity in the test section as measured at point B is ___________ m/s."
