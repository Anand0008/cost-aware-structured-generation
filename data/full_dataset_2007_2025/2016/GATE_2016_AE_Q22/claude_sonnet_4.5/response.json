The correct answer is 'static pressure', which corresponds to option B.\n\nDuring cruising flight, the aircraft's altitude is primarily measured using an altimeter, which operates on the principle of an aneroid barometer. The altimeter senses the static air pressure and converts it to an altitude reading based on the standard atmosphere model. This is the standard method for determining altitude during normal flight operations, as it provides a continuous and reliable indication of the aircraft's height above the ground or sea level.\n\nThe other options are not the primary means of measuring altitude during cruising flight:\nA. Dynamic pressure is used to measure airspeed, not altitude.\nC. Radar can be used to measure altitude, but is not the usual method during cruising.\nD. Laser rangefinders are not commonly used to measure altitude on aircraft during cruising flight."
