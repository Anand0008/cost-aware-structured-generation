The altimeter senses the ambient static pressure from the static port and converts this pressure reading into an altitude display, calibrated according to a standard atmosphere model. Dynamic pressure (Option A) is used for airspeed measurement. Radar (Option C) and laser range finders (Option D) measure absolute height above ground level (AGL), but the barometric altimeter, which relies on static pressure, is the primary and most commonly used instrument for general cruising altitude measurement and vertical separation by Air Traffic Control (ATC)."
