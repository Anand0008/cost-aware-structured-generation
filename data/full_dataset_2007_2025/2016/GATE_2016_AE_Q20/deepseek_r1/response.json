        "reasoning": "From the thrust equation $F = \\dot{m} V_e + (P_e - P_a) A_e$, for a given chamber pressure (which affects $\\dot{m}$, $V_e$, and $P_e$ via nozzle design), thrust $F$ is maximized when $P_a$ is minimum. In vacuum, $P_a = 0$, so the pressure thrust term $P_e A_e$ is fully additive, yielding highest thrust. At sea-level, $P_a > 0$, reducing thrust. At design altitude, $P_e \\approx P_a$ for optimum expansion, but thrust is not necessarily highest; vacuum thrust is higher due to $P_a=0$. A normal shock in the nozzle reduces performance, not increases thrust."

          "Step 4: The minimum possible $P_a$ is zero, in vacuum. Therefore, thrust is highest when $P_a = 0$, i.e., in vacuum.",
