Earth radius: $R_0 = 6378\\,\\text{km}$, altitude: $h = 350\\,\\text{km}$, so orbital radius $R = R_0 + h = 6728\\,\\text{km} = 6.728\\times 10^6\\,\\text{m}$. Circular orbit speed is $u_s = \\sqrt{\\mu/R}$ with $\\mu = 3.986\\times 10^{14}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$. Thus\n$u_s = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3.986\\times 10^{14}}{6.728\\times 10^6}} \\approx \\sqrt{5.925\\times 10^7} \\approx 7.70\\,\\text{km/s}.$\nThe satellite is injected with $u = 8.0\\,\\text{km/s}$, which is greater than circular velocity but less than escape velocity at that radius. Escape velocity is $u_e = \\sqrt{2\\mu/R} = \\sqrt{2}\\,u_s \\approx 1.414\\times 7.70 \\approx 10.9\\,\\text{km/s}$. Since $u_s < u < u_e$, the specific mechanical energy is negative (bound orbit) but larger than that of a circular orbit, so the trajectory is an ellipse with perigee at the injection point. Therefore, the satellite forms an elliptic orbit, matching option B."
