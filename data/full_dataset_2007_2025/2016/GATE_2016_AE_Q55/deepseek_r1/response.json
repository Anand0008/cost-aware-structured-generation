The satellite's injected velocity (8.0 km/s) is greater than the circular orbit velocity at that altitude (~7.02 km/s) but less than the escape velocity (~9.92 km/s).

Chunk 2 (Hohmann transfer example) illustrates the use of the vis-viva equation. Chunks 4 and 5 discuss geostationary and other orbits but are less directly relevant. The RAG context lacked a direct example of this exact type of 'orbit determination from injection conditions' problem, but the formulas were sufficient. Internal knowledge was used to apply the criteria and perform the calculation."
