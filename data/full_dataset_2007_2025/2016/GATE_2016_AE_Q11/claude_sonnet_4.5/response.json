This is because the material properties are the same in all directions, and the relationships between the elastic constants (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus) are known. The two independent constants are typically chosen as Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (ν). All other elastic constants, such as the bulk modulus (K) and shear modulus (G), can be derived from these two. Therefore, the total number of independent material constants required is 2."
