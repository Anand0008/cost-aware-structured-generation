According to NACA 4-digit series nomenclature (NACA PMTT), the second digit 'M' represents the location of the maximum camber from the leading edge in tenths of the chord. Therefore, for the maximum camber to be at $0.5c$, the second digit 'M' must be 5 (since $5/10 = 0.5$). Among the given options:\n*   A. NACA 5212: Second digit is 2, so max camber at $0.2c$.\n*   B. NACA 1225: Second digit is 2, so max camber at $0.2c$.\n*   C. NACA 2215: Second digit is 2, so max camber at $0.2c$.\n*   D. NACA 2512: Second digit is 5, so max camber at $0.5c$.\nThus, NACA 2512 is the correct answer."

          "Step 3: Interpret the meaning of each digit in the NACA 4-digit series. The first digit 'P' indicates the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord. The second digit 'M' indicates the location of the maximum camber from the leading edge, in tenths of the chord. The last two digits 'TT' indicate the maximum thickness as a percentage of the chord.",
          "Step 4: Focus on the location of maximum camber. The problem states this location should be $0.5c$. From the nomenclature rules, the location of maximum camber is given by $(\\frac{M}{10}) \\times c$.",
          "Step 5: Determine the required value for 'M'. To have the maximum camber at $0.5c$, we set $(\\frac{M}{10}) \\times c = 0.5c$. This simplifies to $\\frac{M}{10} = 0.5$, which means $M = 5$.",
          "Step 6: Examine the given options and identify the airfoil with '5' as its second digit.\n    *   A. NACA 5212: Second digit is 2 (location $0.2c$).\n    *   B. NACA 1225: Second digit is 2 (location $0.2c$).\n    *   C. NACA 2215: Second digit is 2 (location $0.2c$).\n    *   D. NACA 2512: Second digit is 5 (location $0.5c$).",
