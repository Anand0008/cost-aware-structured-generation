Based on the NACA 5-digit airfoil nomenclature, the second and third digits represent the location of the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord. For a NACA 2512 airfoil, the maximum camber is located at 25% of the chord from the leading edge, which is not half the chord length. However, for a NACA 2512 airfoil, the maximum camber is located at 50% of the chord from the leading edge, which matches the question's requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: NACA 2512."
