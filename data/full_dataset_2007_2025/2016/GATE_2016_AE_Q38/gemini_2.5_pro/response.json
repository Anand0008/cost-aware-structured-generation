Given $E = 1 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $I = 100 \\text{ mm}^4$, and $L = 100 \\text{ mm}$, the beam stiffness is $K_b = \\frac{3 \\times (1 \\times 10^5) \\times 100}{(100)^3} = 30 \\text{ N/mm}$. The spring stiffness is given as $K_s = 30 \\text{ N/mm}$. From the image, the load $P$ is applied at point 'B' where both the beam and the spring are connected and deflect together. This indicates a parallel combination of stiffnesses. Therefore, the equivalent stiffness of the system is $K_{eq} = K_b + K_s = 30 + 30 = 60 \\text{ N/mm}$. The deflection at point 'B' is then $\\delta_B = \\frac{P}{K_{eq}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ N}}{60 \\text{ N/mm}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ mm} \\approx 1.667 \\text{ mm}$.
