        "reasoning": "The specific work done by a turbine stage ($W_s$) is determined by the Euler Turbine Equation: $W_s = u(c_{w2} - c_{w3})$, where $u$ is the mean blade speed, $c_{w2}$ is the tangential (whirl) component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet, and $c_{w3}$ is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet. The problem states 'axial absolute flow at the entry and exit from the stage'. This implies that the tangential component of absolute velocity at the rotor exit is zero, i.e., $c_{w3} = 0$. Therefore, the specific work equation simplifies to $W_s = u c_{w2}$.\\n\\nGiven:\\n- Specific work, $W_s = 228 \\text{ kJ/kg} = 228,000 \\text{ J/kg}$\\n- Mean blade speed, $u = 440 \\text{ m/s}$\\n\\nFrom the simplified Euler equation, we can find $c_{w2}$:\\n$c_{w2} = \\frac{W_s}{u} = \\frac{228,000 \\text{ J/kg}}{440 \\text{ m/s}} = 518.1818 \\text{ m/s}$\\n\\nThe nozzle exit angle (which is the absolute flow angle at rotor entry), $\\alpha_2$, is given as 70 degrees.

          "Step 4: Incorporate the condition of axial absolute flow at the stage exit. This means the tangential component of absolute velocity at the rotor exit is zero ($c_{w3} = 0$). The Euler equation simplifies to $W_s = u c_{w2}$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the tangential component of absolute velocity at the rotor entry ($c_{w2}$) using the simplified Euler equation: $c_{w2} = \\frac{W_s}{u} = \\frac{228,000 \\text{ J/kg}}{440 \\text{ m/s}} = 518.1818 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "Step 6: Relate the tangential component $c_{w2}$ to the absolute velocity at rotor entry $c_2$ and the nozzle exit angle $\\alpha_2$. Given that $\\alpha_2$ is the angle of the absolute velocity $c_2$ with the axial direction (a common convention in turbomachinery, as noted in RAG Chunk 3), the relationship is $c_{w2} = c_2 \\sin(\\alpha_2)$.",
          "Step 7: Solve for the absolute velocity at the rotor entry ($c_2$): $c_2 = \\frac{c_{w2}}{\\sin(\\alpha_2)} = \\frac{518.1818 \\text{ m/s}}{\\sin(70^\\circ)} = \\frac{518.1818 \\text{ m/s}}{0.93969} \\approx 551.43 \\text{ m/s}$. Rounding to one decimal place gives $551.5 \\text{ m/s}$."
