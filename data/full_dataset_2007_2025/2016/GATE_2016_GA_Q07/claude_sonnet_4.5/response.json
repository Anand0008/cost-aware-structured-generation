This directly supports the inference that mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with advanced degrees in the field, which corresponds to answer option C. The question also mentions that 60% of students believe mechanical engineering is unsuitable for women, indicating that many students have misconceptions about the field, which aligns with answer option A. However, the question does not provide any information about the beliefs of men with advanced degrees in mechanical engineering, so option B cannot be logically inferred.
