The research suggests the belief might be a misconception, but 'many' is vague and the scope is too broad. This is not a necessary inference.",

          "Step 6: Option C: 'Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering.' The research study (99% success rate) directly supports this statement. If the profession were not well suited, a high success rate would be unlikely. This is a valid, direct inference.",
          "Step 7: Option D: 'The number of women pursuing higher degrees in mechanical engineering is small.' The premises give a success rate (percentage), not absolute numbers. A high success rate is possible irrespective of the total number (small or large). This inference is not supported by the data."
