To call them \"misconceptions\" we must assume that the belief is false; that is an extra assumption beyond the passage.\n- B: \"Men with advanced degrees... believe women are well suited...\" The passage says nothing about men with advanced degrees or their beliefs, so this cannot be inferred.\n- D: \"The number of women pursuing higher degrees... is small.\" The passage gives no information about how many women pursue such degrees, only about success rate among those who do.\n\nTherefore, only option C is logically supported by the given information, matching the official key."
