        "reasoning": "The second statement explicitly provides empirical evidence: 'A research study on women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering found that 99 % of such women were successful in their professions.' A success rate of 99% is exceptionally high and directly indicates that the profession is highly suitable and conducive to success for women with such qualifications. Therefore, Option C, 'Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering,' is a direct and strong logical inference from this factual statement. While Option A (misconceptions) is also inferable by contrasting the two statements, Option C is a more direct and positive conclusion about the profession's inherent suitability based on the strong empirical evidence provided."

      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Analyze the first statement. It presents a perception or belief: '60 % of the students believed that mechanical engineering is a profession unsuitable for women.' This highlights a common opinion.",
          "Step 2: Analyze the second statement. It presents a factual finding: 'A research study on women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering found that 99 % of such women were successful in their professions.' This provides strong empirical evidence.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'Many students have misconceptions regarding various engineering disciplines.' This is a plausible inference because the 60% belief (unsuitability) directly contradicts the 99% success rate, indicating a misconception.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: 'Men with advanced degrees in mechanical engineering believe women are well suited to be mechanical engineers.' The paragraph does not provide any information about the beliefs of men with advanced degrees, only about 'students appearing for masters'. Therefore, this cannot be inferred.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering.' The 99% success rate is a very strong indicator that the profession is indeed suitable for this group. This is a direct and robust inference from the second statement.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: 'The number of women pursuing higher degrees in mechanical engineering is small.' The paragraph provides no data or information regarding the *number* of women, only their success *rate*. Therefore, this cannot be inferred.",
          "Step 7: Compare the strongest inferences (A and C). Option C makes a direct statement about the *suitability of the profession* based on strong evidence. Option A makes a statement about the *beliefs of students* based on the contrast. In logical reasoning, an inference that directly states a characteristic or truth about the subject based on evidence is often considered the primary inference.",
          "Step 8: Conclude that Option C is the most direct and strongest logical inference about the profession itself, supported by the high success rate."
