          "Step 4: Determine $L$ from the dimensions. The channel has a web (height = 100 mm) and two flanges (width = 100 mm each). Assuming thickness $t$ is small, approximate $L \\approx 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \\, \\text{mm}$. More precisely, the midline lengths are web: $100 - t$, each flange: $100 - t/2$, so $L = (100 - t) + 2(100 - t/2) = 300 - 2t$.",

However, Chunk 1 gave a similar result for a three-strip open section, which is analogous. Chunk 3 discussed narrow rectangular strip torsion, the building block. The video chunks were about stepped shafts (different). Thus, RAG was moderately relevant but insufficient for direct solution; internal knowledge was used to derive the required formula."
