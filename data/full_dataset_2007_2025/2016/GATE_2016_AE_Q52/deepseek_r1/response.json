However, the question does not involve these derivative-based formulas; it provides the state matrix directly. Thus, RAG context was helpful for conceptual understanding but not for the specific calculation method required. The solution relied on linear systems theory (characteristic equation from state matrix), which was not covered in the provided RAG chunks."
