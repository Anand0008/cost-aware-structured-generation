          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental behavior of subsonic flow: In subsonic flow, pressure disturbances travel at the speed of sound relative to the flow, allowing information about downstream conditions (back pressure) to propagate upstream. Therefore, the flow adjusts smoothly to match the exit pressure with the back pressure.",
          "Step 3: Apply to a convergent nozzle: For a convergent nozzle with subsonic flow, the flow accelerates from the inlet to the throat (minimum area) and then may decelerate slightly if the back pressure is higher than the critical pressure. Throughout, the pressure distribution adjusts isentropically so that at the exit plane, the static pressure P_e equals the ambient back pressure P_b.",
          "Step 4: Eliminate incorrect options: Option A (P_e > P_b) would cause the flow to expand further after exiting, which does not happen in steady subsonic flow. Option B (P_e < P_b) would cause compression waves or shocks at the exit, violating isentropic and subsonic assumptions. Option D (P_e = total pressure) is incorrect because total pressure (stagnation pressure) is constant along the nozzle in isentropic flow, but static pressure decreases as velocity increases; at the exit, static pressure is less than total pressure except at stagnation points.",
