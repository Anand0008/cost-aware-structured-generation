        "reasoning": "For a completely subsonic isentropic flow through a convergent nozzle, the flow at the nozzle exit is able to adjust its static pressure ($P_e$) to match the ambient back pressure ($P_b$). This is a fundamental characteristic of subsonic flow, where pressure disturbances can propagate both upstream and downstream, allowing the flow to equilibrate with the external conditions at the exit plane. This condition holds true as long as the back pressure is above the critical pressure ($P_b > P^*$), preventing the flow from choking at the nozzle exit. Once the flow chokes (i.e., $P_b \\le P^*$), the exit Mach number becomes 1, and the exit pressure becomes equal to the critical pressure ($P_e = P^*$), which is then greater than the back pressure ($P_e > P_b$) if $P_b < P^*$. However, the question specifically states 'completely subsonic flow,' which implies the unchoked regime where $P_e = P_b$."

          "Step 2: Recall the behavior of subsonic flow exiting into an ambient medium. For any subsonic flow exiting into an environment, the static pressure at the exit plane ($P_e$) will adjust to match the ambient back pressure ($P_b$), provided there are no external obstructions or internal choking effects that prevent this adjustment.",
          "Step 3: Consider the choking condition for a convergent nozzle. A convergent nozzle chokes when the back pressure ($P_b$) drops to or below the critical pressure ($P^*$). At this point, the flow at the exit reaches Mach 1, and the exit pressure becomes $P^*$.",
          "Step 4: Relate to the 'completely subsonic' condition. The condition 'completely subsonic' implies that the flow has not yet choked, meaning the back pressure is still high enough such that $P_b > P^*$. In this unchoked, subsonic regime, the flow is able to communicate pressure changes upstream and downstream, allowing the exit pressure to equalize with the back pressure.",
          "Step 5: Conclude based on the identified regime. Therefore, for completely subsonic isentropic flow through a convergent nozzle, the pressure at the nozzle exit is equal to the back pressure."
