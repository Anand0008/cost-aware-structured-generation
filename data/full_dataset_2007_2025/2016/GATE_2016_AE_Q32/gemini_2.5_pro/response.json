The solution involves two main steps:\n1.  Determine the lift curve slope of the 2D airfoil section ($a_0$) using thin airfoil theory.\n2.  Calculate the lift curve slope of the finite wing ($a$) using the formula for an elliptic wing.\n3.  Calculate the lift coefficient ($C_L$) for the finite wing at the given angle of attack.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_0$)**\nFor a thin symmetric airfoil in inviscid, incompressible flow, thin airfoil theory states that the lift curve slope is $2\\pi$ per radian (as mentioned in RAG Chunks 1 and 3).\nSo, $a_0 = 2\\pi$ rad$^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the angle of attack to radians**\nThe given angle of attack is $10^{\\circ}$. To use it with the lift curve slope (which is in per radian), we must convert it to radians:\n$\\alpha = 10^{\\circ} \\times \\frac{\\pi \\text{ rad}}{180^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\pi}{18}$ radians.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the finite wing lift curve slope ($a$)**\nFor an untwisted elliptic wing, the finite wing lift curve slope ($a$) is related to the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_0$) and the aspect ratio (AR) by the formula (from RAG Chunks 2 and 5):\n$a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + a_0 / (\\pi AR)}$\nGiven $AR = 6$ and $a_0 = 2\\pi$ rad$^{-1}$:\n$a = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 2\\pi / (\\pi \\times 6)} = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 2/6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 1/3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4/3}$\n$a = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ rad$^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the lift coefficient ($C_L$)**\nFor a symmetric airfoil (or a wing made of symmetric airfoils), the lift coefficient at a given angle of attack (measured from the zero-lift line) is given by:\n$C_L = a \\times \\alpha$\nUsing the calculated finite wing lift curve slope $a = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ rad$^{-1}$ and the angle of attack $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{18}$ radians:\n$C_L = \\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{18}\\right) = \\frac{3\\pi^2}{36} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12}$\n\nThis matches option B."
