        "reasoning": "According to thin airfoil theory, the aerodynamic center (AC) is located at the quarter-chord point ($x_{ac} = 0.25c$). A fundamental property of the aerodynamic center is that the pitching moment coefficient ($C_{m,ac}$) about this point is constant with respect to the angle of attack ($\\alpha$). Therefore, the rate of change of moment coefficient at the AC is zero: $\\frac{dC_{m,ac}}{d\\alpha} = 0$.\n\nThin airfoil theory also states that the lift curve slope for any thin airfoil is $\\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha} = 2\\pi$ per radian.\n\nThe pitching moment coefficient about an arbitrary point $x$ (measured from the leading edge) can be related to the moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center using the moment transformation formula:\n$C_{m,x} = C_{m,ac} + C_l \\left( \\frac{x - x_{ac}}{c} \\right)$\n\nWe need to find the rate of change of moment coefficient at the half-chord point, so we set $x = 0.5c$. Substituting $x_{ac} = 0.25c$ (the quarter-chord):\n$C_{m,c/2} = C_{m,c/4} + C_l \\left( \\frac{0.5c - 0.25c}{c} \\right)$\n$C_{m,c/2} = C_{m,c/4} + C_l \\left( \\frac{0.25c}{c} \\right)$\n$C_{m,c/2} = C_{m,c/4} + \\frac{C_l}{4}$\n\nNow, differentiate this expression with respect to the angle of attack $\\alpha$:\n$\\frac{dC_{m,c/2}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left( C_{m,c/4} + \\frac{C_l}{4} \\right)$\n$\\frac{dC_{m,c/2}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{dC_{m,c/4}}{d\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha}$\n\nSubstitute the known values: $\\frac{dC_{m,c/4}}{d\\alpha} = 0$ (since $c/4$ is the AC) and $\\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha} = 2\\pi$:\n$\\frac{dC_{m,c/2}}{d\\alpha} = 0 + \\frac{1}{4} (2\\pi)$\n$\\frac{dC_{m,c/2}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radian$^{-1}$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B."
