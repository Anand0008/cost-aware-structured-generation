From the provided table, the maximum $C_L/C_D$ is 25.7, which corresponds to a lift coefficient ($C_L$) of 0.90. For equilibrium glide, the lift force ($L$) must balance the weight ($W$) of the glider (assuming a small glide angle, $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1$). The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. Setting $L=W$ and solving for velocity $V$ gives $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}}$. Substituting the given values: $W = 3300 \\text{ N}$, $S = 14.1 \\text{ m}^2$, $\\rho = 1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, and $C_L = 0.90$, we get $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3300}{1.23 \\times 14.1 \\times 0.90}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6600}{15.6123}} \\approx \\sqrt{422.74} \\approx 20.56 \\text{ m/s}$.
