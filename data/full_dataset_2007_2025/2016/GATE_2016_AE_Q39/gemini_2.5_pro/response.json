        "reasoning": "Statement [a] is true: Wing ribs act as intermediate supports for longitudinal stiffeners (also known as stringers). By providing these supports, ribs effectively reduce the unsupported length of the stiffeners. According to Euler's critical buckling load formula, $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(KL)^2}$, where $L$ is the effective length, reducing $L$ significantly increases the critical buckling load, thereby enhancing the column buckling strength of the stiffeners. This function is consistently highlighted in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nStatement [r] is true: Ribs are crucial for absorbing and transmitting large concentrated loads from various sources such as engines, landing gear, and external stores into the broader wing structure. They also play a role in redistributing stresses, particularly around points of load introduction or structural discontinuities, to prevent localized stress concentrations and ensure a smoother stress flow. This function is also well-supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nHowever, [r] is not the correct reason for [a]. The reason ribs increase buckling strength (statement [a]) is due to their role as intermediate supports that reduce the effective length of the stiffeners. The function of distributing concentrated loads and redistributing stresses (statement [r]) is a distinct, albeit equally vital, function of ribs. One does not directly cause or explain the other in the context of a reason-assertion relationship. Therefore, both statements are true, but [r] is not the correct reason for [a], making option B the correct answer."
