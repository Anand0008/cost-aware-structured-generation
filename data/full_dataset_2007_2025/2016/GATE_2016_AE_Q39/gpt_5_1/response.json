The Euler buckling load is \\(P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}\\). By adding ribs, the effective length L between supports decreases, so \\(P_{cr}\\) increases. Thus [a] is true.\\nStatement [r]: \"Ribs distribute concentrated loads into the structure and redistribute stresses around discontinuities.\"\\nRAG explicitly states that ribs (and frames) are used to introduce and distribute concentrated loads (engines, landing gear, stores) into the skin-stringer system and to smooth stress concentrations around discontinuities. So [r] is also true.\\nIs [r] the correct reason for [a]?\\nThe mechanism in [a] is about column buckling of longitudinal stiffeners, governed by effective length reduction due to intermediate supports (ribs). The mechanism in [r] is about load introduction and stress redistribution around discontinuities. While both are true functions of ribs, the load-distribution role in [r] is not the reason why ribs increase column buckling strength; that comes from geometric restraint and reduced effective length. Therefore, both [a] and [r] are true, but [r] is not the correct reason for [a], matching option B."
