        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the difference between the total production of 'large plants' and 'small plants'. First, we categorize the plants based on their 'Installed Capacity' as given in the graph and the problem statement.\n\n**1. Categorize Plants:**\n   *   **Large Plant:** Installed capacity $\\ge 200$ tonnes.\n   *   **Small Plant:** Installed capacity $< 200$ tonnes.\n\n   From the graph (green bars for Installed Capacity):\n   *   **Large Plants:**\n        *   Plant 1: 220 tonnes\n        *   Plant 4: 200 tonnes\n        *   Plant 8: 250 tonnes\n        *   Plant 9: 200 tonnes\n   *   **Small Plants:**\n        *   Plant 2: 180 tonnes\n        *   Plant 3: 190 tonnes\n        *   Plant 5: 160 tonnes\n        *   Plant 6: 150 tonnes\n        *   Plant 7: 140 tonnes\n\n**2. Calculate Total Production for Large Plants:**\n   We need to sum the 'Actual Production' (red bars) for the large plants:\n   *   Plant 1 Production: 160 tonnes\n   *   Plant 4 Production: 190 tonnes\n   *   Plant 8 Production: 230 tonnes\n   *   Plant 9 Production: 190 tonnes\n   Total Production (Large Plants) = $160 + 190 + 230 + 190 = 770$ tonnes.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Production for Small Plants:**\n   We need to sum the 'Actual Production' (red bars) for the small plants:\n   *   Plant 2 Production: 150 tonnes\n   *   Plant 3 Production: 160 tonnes\n   *   Plant 5 Production: 120 tonnes\n   *   Plant 6 Production: 100 tonnes\n   *   Plant 7 Production: 120 tonnes\n   Total Production (Small Plants) = $150 + 160 + 120 + 100 + 120 = 650$ tonnes.\n\n**4. Calculate the Difference:**\n   Difference = Total Production (Large Plants) - Total Production (Small Plants)\n   Difference = $770 - 650 = 120$ tonnes.\n\nThe calculated difference is 120 tonnes, which matches the provided correct answer."
