        "reasoning": "To find the units digit of the expression $211^{870} + 146^{127} \\times 3^{424}$, we need to determine the units digit of each term separately and then combine them following the order of operations.\n\n1.  **Units digit of $211^{870}$:**\n    The units digit of the base $211$ is $1$. Any positive integer power of a number ending in $1$ will also end in $1$. Therefore, the units digit of $211^{870}$ is $1$.\n\n2.  **Units digit of $146^{127}$:**\n    The units digit of the base $146$ is $6$. Any positive integer power of a number ending in $6$ will also end in $6$. Therefore, the units digit of $146^{127}$ is $6$.\n\n3.  **Units digit of $3^{424}$:**\n    The units digit of powers of $3$ follows a cycle:\n    $3^1 = 3$\n    $3^2 = 9$\n    $3^3 = 27 \\rightarrow 7$\n    $3^4 = 81 \\rightarrow 1$\n    $3^5 = 243 \\rightarrow 3$\n    The cycle length for the units digit of powers of $3$ is $4$ (i.e., $3, 9, 7, 1$). To find the units digit of $3^{424}$, we need to find the remainder when the exponent $424$ is divided by the cycle length $4$.\n    $424 \\div 4 = 106$ with a remainder of $0$. When the remainder is $0$, it corresponds to the last digit in the cycle, which is the $4^{th}$ digit, $1$. Therefore, the units digit of $3^{424}$ is $1$.\n\n4.  **Combine the units digits:**\n    Now, substitute the units digits back into the original expression:\n    Units digit of $(211^{870} + 146^{127} \\times 3^{424})$\n    = Units digit of $(1 + 6 \\times 1)$\n    = Units digit of $(1 + 6)$\n    = Units digit of $(7)$\n    = $7$\n\nThus, the numeral in the units position of the given expression is $7$."
