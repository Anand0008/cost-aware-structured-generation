Any positive integer power of 1 has units digit 1, so this term contributes units digit 1.\\n2) For 146^{127} \\times 3^{424}, first find units digits separately. 146 has units digit 6, so 146^{127} has units digit of 6^{127}. Powers of 6 always end in 6 (cycle length 1), so its units digit is 6.\\n3) Now find units digit of 3^{424}. Powers of 3 have a cycle of length 4 in the units digit: 3, 9, 7, 1 for exponents 1,2,3,4 then repeat. Compute 424 \\bmod 4: 424/4 = 106 remainder 0, so exponent is a multiple of 4, corresponding to the 4th position in the cycle, units digit 1. Thus 3^{424} ends in 1.\\n4) Multiply the units digits: 6 (from 146^{127}) times 1 (from 3^{424}) gives units digit 6. So the product 146^{127} \\times 3^{424} has units digit 6.\\n5) Add the units digits of the two terms: 1 (from 211^{870}) + 6 (from the product) = 7, so the overall units digit is 7.
