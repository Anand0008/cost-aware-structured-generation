        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) at a specific point (A) in a potential flow. Potential flow, in the absence of explicit compressibility information (like Mach number), implies incompressible, inviscid, and steady flow. For such a flow, the pressure coefficient can be directly calculated using the relationship derived from Bernoulli's equation:\n$C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{U}{U_{\\infty}}\\right)^2$\nWhere:\n$U$ = local velocity at point A = 20 m/s\n$U_{\\infty}$ = freestream velocity = 10 m/s\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{20 \\text{ m/s}}{10 \\text{ m/s}}\\right)^2$\n$C_p = 1 - (2)^2$\n$C_p = 1 - 4$\n$C_p = -3$\n\nThis result is consistent with the physical understanding that when the local velocity is greater than the freestream velocity, the local static pressure is lower than the freestream static pressure, resulting in a negative pressure coefficient. The calculated value matches the provided correct answer."
