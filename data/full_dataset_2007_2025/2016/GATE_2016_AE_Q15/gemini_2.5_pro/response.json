According to the principles of stress transformation and Mohr's Circle, for a state of pure shear, these principal planes are always oriented at $45^{\\circ}$ with respect to the planes on which the pure shear stress acts. If we consider the plane of pure shear as the reference ($0^{\\circ}$), then the principal planes are located at $45^{\\circ}$ and $45^{\\circ} + 90^{\\circ} = 135^{\\circ}$ (since principal planes are always mutually perpendicular). Converting these angles to radians: $45^{\\circ} = \\pi/4$ radians and $135^{\\circ} = 3\\pi/4$ radians. The magnitude of the shear stress ($50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$) is irrelevant for determining the angles of the principal planes."

          "Step 1: Identify the given stress state. The problem states a 'state of pure shear stress'. This means that on the reference plane, only shear stress ($\\tau_{xy}$) exists, and normal stresses ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$) are zero.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of principal planes. Principal planes are planes within a material where the shear stress is zero, and the normal stresses are either maximum (major principal stress, $\\sigma_1$) or minimum (minor principal stress, $\\sigma_2$).",
          "Step 3: Apply the stress transformation relationship for pure shear. For a state of pure shear (where $\\sigma_x = 0$ and $\\sigma_y = 0$), the angle of the principal planes ($\\theta_P$) with respect to the original shear plane can be found using the formula $\\tan(2\\theta_P) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}$. Substituting $\\sigma_x = 0$ and $\\sigma_y = 0$, we get $\\tan(2\\theta_P) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{0}$, which is undefined.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the undefined tangent. An undefined tangent implies that $2\\theta_P = \\pm 90^{\\circ}$ (or $\\pm \\pi/2$ radians). Therefore, $\\theta_P = \\pm 45^{\\circ}$ (or $\\pm \\pi/4$ radians).",
          "Step 5: Determine the two principal plane orientations. Since principal planes are always mutually perpendicular, if one plane is at $45^{\\circ}$, the other will be at $45^{\\circ} + 90^{\\circ} = 135^{\\circ}$. In radians, these are $\\pi/4$ and $3\\pi/4$. These angles are with respect to the plane of pure shear.",
          "Step 6: Note the irrelevance of shear stress magnitude. The magnitude of the pure shear stress ($50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$) is not required to determine the angles of the principal planes; it only affects the magnitude of the principal stresses ($\\sigma_1 = 50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $\\sigma_2 = -50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$)."
