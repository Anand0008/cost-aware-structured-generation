          "Step 2: Interpret the third statement: 'No other robot can repair aeroplanes' means any robot that is not R2D2 cannot repair aeroplanes. This is equivalent to: If something is a robot and can repair aeroplanes, it must be R2D2. Formally: ∀x ( (R(x) ∧ P(x)) → x = R2D2 ).",

Our statements only discuss repairing aeroplanes, not other capabilities, so we cannot infer this.",

          "Step 7: Option D: 'Only R2D2 is a robot.' This means there are no robots other than R2D2 (∀x (R(x) → x = R2D2)). Our third statement allows for other robots that cannot repair aeroplanes, so this is too strong and not inferred."
