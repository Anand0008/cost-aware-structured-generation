        "reasoning": "Dynamic similarity between model and prototype in different fluids requires matching Reynolds number. For external flow over a body, force scales as dynamic pressure times area, i.e., proportional to $\\rho V^2 L^2$ for a given shape. From Reynolds number equality, $\\mathrm{Re}_m = \\mathrm{Re}_p$, we obtain $V_m = V_p\\,(\\rho_p/\\rho_m)(\\mu_m/\\mu_p)(L_p/L_m)$. Substituting this into the force ratio expression $F_m/F_p = (\\rho_m V_m^2 L_m^2)/(\\rho_p V_p^2 L_p^2)$ yields $F_m/F_p = (\\rho_p/\\rho_m)(\\mu_m/\\mu_p)^2$. Using the given properties: $\\rho_p = 1.22\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_p = 1.78\\times10^{-5}\\,\\text{N·s/m}^2$, $\\rho_m = 1000\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_m = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{N·s/m}^2$, we get $\\rho_p/\\rho_m = 0.00122$ and $(\\mu_m/\\mu_p)^2 = (10^{-3}/1.78\\times10^{-5})^2 \\approx 56.18^2 \\approx 3156$.
