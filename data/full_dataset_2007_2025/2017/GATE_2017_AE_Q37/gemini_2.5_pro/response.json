        "reasoning": "The problem requires applying the principle of dynamic similarity to relate the forces on a model and a prototype. For a low-speed flow like a football (100 km/h is approximately 27.8 m/s, which is well below Mach 0.3), compressibility effects are negligible, and thus, dynamic similarity is primarily achieved by matching the Reynolds number ($Re$) between the model (m) and the prototype (p).\n\n1.  **Convert Prototype Velocity:**\n    $V_p = 100 \\text{ km/h} = 100 \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 27.777... \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Reynolds Number Matching:**\n    $Re_m = Re_p$\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p}$\n    Rearrange to find the ratio of velocities:\n    $\\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)$\n\n3.  **Aerodynamic Force Coefficient Equality:**\n    For dynamic similarity, the dimensionless force coefficients are equal:\n    $C_F_m = C_F_p$\n    The force coefficient is defined as $C_F = \\frac{F}{0.5 \\rho V^2 S}$, where $S$ is the reference area. So,\n    $\\frac{F_m}{0.5 \\rho_m V_m^2 S_m} = \\frac{F_p}{0.5 \\rho_p V_p^2 S_p}$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Forces:**\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_m}{V_p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{S_m}{S_p} \\right)$\n\n5.  **Area Scaling:**\n    For geometric similarity, the area scales with the square of the linear dimension:\n    $\\frac{S_m}{S_p} = \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    Given $L_m/L_p = 1/4$, so $S_m/S_p = (1/4)^2 = 1/16$.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Substitute the expression for $V_m/V_p$ and $S_m/S_p$ into the force ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right) \\right]^2 \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Plug in Values:**\n    Given:\n    $\\rho_p = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_p = 1.78 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$\n    $\\rho_m = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_m = 10^{-3} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$\n\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{1.22}{1000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{-3}}{1.78 \\times 10^{-5}} \\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = 0.00122 \\times (56.179775...)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = 0.00122 \\times 3156.168089...$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} \\approx 3.8505$\n\n8.  **Round to Nearest Integer:**\n    The ratio of the model force to the prototype force is approximately 4."
