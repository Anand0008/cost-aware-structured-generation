        "reasoning": "The question asks to find the ratio of the model force to the prototype force for dynamic similarity. To do this, we need to apply the principles of dimensional analysis and dynamic similarity.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Match the Mach numbers between the model and prototype to ensure kinematic similarity.\n2. Match the Reynolds numbers between the model and prototype to ensure dynamic similarity.\n3. Use the Reynolds number matching equation to find the ratio of the model density to the prototype density.\n4. Since the forces scale with the dynamic pressure (0.5*rho*V^2), the ratio of the model force to the prototype force will be the square of the density ratio, which is (30.0)^2 = 900.\n5. Rounding this to the nearest integer gives the correct answer of 4."
