        "reasoning": "Deploying landing gear increases parasite drag significantly while lift coefficient, altitude, and weight are to be kept the same. In steady level flight, vertical balance requires $L = W$ and longitudinal balance requires $T = D$. With $C_L$ fixed and altitude fixed, the pilot must keep airspeed essentially the same to maintain the same lift (since $L = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$). However, drag $D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$ increases because $C_D$ increases when the gear is down. To restore $T = D$, thrust must be increased, so throttle must be increased. \n\nPitch-wise, deploying the landing gear usually introduces a small nose-down pitching moment (due to added drag and change in aerodynamic forces below the CG). To maintain the same $C_L$ (same angle of attack) and keep the aircraft in trim, the pilot must command a nose-up pitching moment, which is achieved by moving the elevator trailing edge up (\"elevator up\"). Therefore, the correct combined action is: move the elevator up and increase the throttle, which corresponds to option B."

          "2. When landing gear is fully deployed at the same altitude and same $C_L$, the parasite drag coefficient $C_D$ increases, so drag $D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$ increases at the same speed.",
          "3. To maintain steady level flight at the same $C_L$ and altitude, lift must still equal weight. With $C_L$ and $\\rho$ fixed, the speed $V$ should remain essentially the same, so $L$ remains equal to $W$.",
          "4. Because drag has increased while speed is unchanged, to keep $T = D$ the pilot must increase thrust, i.e., increase throttle.",
          "5. The gear deployment generally causes a nose-down pitching tendency (extra drag and altered force distribution). To maintain the same $C_L$ (same angle of attack) and trim, the pilot must apply a nose-up control input: elevator trailing edge up (\"move the elevator up\").",
