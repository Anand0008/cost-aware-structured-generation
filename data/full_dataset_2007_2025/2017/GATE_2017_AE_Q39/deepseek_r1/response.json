        "reasoning": "In steady level flight, lift equals weight ($L = W$) and thrust equals drag ($T = D$). Deploying the landing gear significantly increases drag ($D_{new} > D_{initial}$). To maintain the same speed (required for the same $C_L$ and weight at constant altitude), thrust must be increased to match the new drag. The increased drag typically acts below the center of gravity, creating a nose-down pitching moment. To maintain the same angle of attack (and hence $C_L$) and trim the aircraft, a nose-up moment is needed. Pulling the control stick (moving the elevator trailing edge up) generates this nose-up moment. Therefore, the pilot must increase throttle and move the elevator up."

Same speed is required because $L = 0.5 \\rho V^2 S C_L = W$; with $C_L$, $\\rho$, $S$, and $W$ constant, $V$ must remain unchanged.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the pitching moment effect. The added drag from the landing gear usually acts below the aircraft's center of gravity, creating a nose-down pitching moment. This disturbance tends to decrease the angle of attack.",
          "Step 5: Determine the required elevator action. To maintain the same $C_L$ (same angle of attack), the pilot must counteract the nose-down moment by generating a nose-up moment. Pulling the control stick (moving elevator trailing edge up) produces this nose-up moment.",
