When the landing gear is deployed, the aircraft's drag increases, which reduces the lift generated at the same airspeed. To maintain the same lift coefficient (CL=0.5) at the same altitude, the pilot needs to increase the angle of attack by moving the elevator up. This increases the lift. Additionally, the pilot needs to increase the throttle to generate more thrust to overcome the increased drag from the deployed landing gear and maintain steady level flight."
