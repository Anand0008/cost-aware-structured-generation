Assumptions: ideal expansion in nozzle (so exit pressure P_e = P_a), fuel mass neglected (constant mass flow rate).",

    "question_text": "An aircraft with a turbojet engine, having an inlet area of 1 m^2, is flying at 270 m/s at an altitude where the atmospheric pressure is equal to 0.9 bar and the ambient temperature is equal to 290 K. The stagnation pressure and temperature at the exit of the turbine are equal to 1.6 bar and 774 K respectively. The specific heat at constant pressure of the burned gases is equal to 1.147 kJ/kgK and the ratio of specific heats is equal to 1.33. Considering ideal expansion in the nozzle and neglecting fuel mass, the specific thrust produced by the engine is ________ Ns/kg (in one decimal place)."
