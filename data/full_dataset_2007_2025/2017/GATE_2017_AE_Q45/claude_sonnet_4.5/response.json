        "reasoning": "The question asks to find the flow rate of Octane (C8H18) given the stoichiometric air flow rate of 1 kg/s. To solve this, we need to first calculate the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for Octane combustion, and then use that to find the corresponding fuel flow rate.\n\nThe stoichiometric combustion equation for Octane is:\nC8H18 + 12.5(O2 + 3.76N2) -> 8CO2 + 9H2O + 47N2\n\nThe stoichiometric air-fuel ratio by mass is:\n(A/F)_stoich = (12.5 * (32.0 + 3.76 * 28.0) kg/kmol) / (114.232 kg/kmol) = 15.15\n\nTherefore, for an air flow rate of 1 kg/s, the corresponding stoichiometric fuel flow rate is:\nm_dot_f = m_dot_a / (A/F)_stoich = 1 kg/s / 15.15 = 0.066 kg/s\n\nThis matches the correct answer provided in the question options."
