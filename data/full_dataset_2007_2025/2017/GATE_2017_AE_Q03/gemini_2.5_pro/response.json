        "reasoning": "The question states that `v(t)` is a unit vector. By definition, a unit vector has a constant magnitude of 1 (i.e., `|v(t)| = 1`). A fundamental property in vector calculus states that if a vector function `\\vec{a}(t)` has a constant magnitude, then its derivative `\\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt}` is perpendicular to `\\vec{a}(t)`. Mathematically, this perpendicularity is expressed by their dot product being zero: `\\vec{a}(t) \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt} = 0`. Applying this property to `v(t)`, since `|v(t)| = 1` (a constant), it directly follows that `v(t) \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = 0`."

If a vector function `\\vec{a}(t)` has a constant magnitude (i.e., `|\\vec{a}(t)| = C`, where `C` is a constant), then its derivative `\\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt}` is perpendicular to the vector `\\vec{a}(t)` itself.",
          "Step 3: Express the condition of perpendicularity using the dot product. Two non-zero vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero. Thus, `\\vec{a}(t) \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt} = 0`.",
          "Step 4: Apply this property to the given vector `v(t)`. Since `v(t)` is a unit vector, its magnitude is constant (`C=1`). Therefore, `v(t)` must be perpendicular to its derivative `\\frac{dv}{dt}`.",
