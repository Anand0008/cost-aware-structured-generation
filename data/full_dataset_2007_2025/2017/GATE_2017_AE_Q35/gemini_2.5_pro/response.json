        "reasoning": "The problem involves a strong normal shock wave propagating into stationary air. To solve this, we must use normal shock wave relations, which are typically defined for a stationary shock with flow approaching it. Therefore, a transformation to a shock-fixed coordinate system is essential.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial speed of sound ($a_1$):** Using the given initial temperature ($T_1 = 280$ K), specific heat ratio ($\\gamma = 1.4$), and gas constant ($R = 287$ J/kg·K), $a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 280} \\approx 335.404$ m/s.\n2.  **Determine the incident Mach number ($M_1$):** The given pressure ratio across the shock is $p_2/p_1 = 29$. Using the normal shock pressure ratio formula: $p_2/p_1 = 1 + \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma+1}(M_1^2 - 1)$.\n    $29 = 1 + \\frac{2 \\times 1.4}{1.4 + 1}(M_1^2 - 1) \\implies 28 = \\frac{2.8}{2.4}(M_1^2 - 1) \\implies 28 = \\frac{7}{6}(M_1^2 - 1)$.\n    Solving for $M_1^2 - 1$: $M_1^2 - 1 = 28 \\times \\frac{6}{7} = 4 \\times 6 = 24$. Thus, $M_1^2 = 25$, and $M_1 = 5$. This $M_1$ represents the Mach number of the shock wave itself relative to the stationary upstream air.\n3.  **Calculate the shock wave speed ($C_s$):** The shock speed is $C_s = M_1 a_1 = 5 \\times 335.404 = 1677.02$ m/s.\n4.  **Calculate the density ratio across the shock ($\\rho_2/\\rho_1$):** Using the normal shock density ratio formula provided in the question: $\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma-1)M_1^2 + 2}$.\n    $\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{(1.4+1) \\times 5^2}{(1.4-1) \\times 5^2 + 2} = \\frac{2.4 \\times 25}{0.4 \\times 25 + 2} = \\frac{60}{10 + 2} = \\frac{60}{12} = 5$.\n5.  **Calculate the induced velocity of the air ($V_{lab2}$):** The induced velocity is the absolute velocity of the air behind the shock in the stationary (lab) frame. In the shock-fixed frame, the upstream velocity is $V_1 = C_s$ and the downstream velocity is $V_2'$. From continuity, $\\rho_1 V_1 = \\rho_2 V_2'$, so $V_2' = V_1 (\\rho_1/\\rho_2) = C_s (\\rho_1/\\rho_2)$.\n    The induced velocity in the lab frame is $V_{lab2} = C_s - V_2' = C_s - C_s (\\rho_1/\\rho_2) = C_s (1 - \\rho_1/\\rho_2)$.\n    Since $\\rho_2/\\rho_1 = 5$, then $\\rho_1/\\rho_2 = 1/5 = 0.2$.\n    $V_{lab2} = 1677.02 \\times (1 - 0.2) = 1677.02 \\times 0.8 = 1341.616$ m/s.\n6.  **Round to the nearest integer:** $V_{lab2} \\approx 1342$ m/s.\n\nThis value falls within the acceptable range of 1341 to 1343 m/s."

Chunk 6 was particularly helpful for finding $M_1$ from $p_2/p_1$, and chunks 1 and 4 for the overall approach to moving shocks. Chunk 2 provided a formula for M2 behind a moving shock, which was an alternative path but the direct calculation using density ratio was more straightforward given the question's provided formulas."
