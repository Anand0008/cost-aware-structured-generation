        "reasoning": "The N-point Gauss Quadrature formula exactly integrates polynomials of degree up to $2N-1$. For a 3-point formula ($N=3$), it exactly integrates polynomials up to degree $2(3)-1 = 5$. Additionally, due to the symmetry of the integration interval $[-1, 1]$ and the symmetric nodes and weights of Gauss-Legendre quadrature, it also exactly integrates any odd function (including odd polynomials of any degree) because the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero, and the symmetric sum $A_j f(x_j)$ will also evaluate to zero for an odd function.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Option A: $f(x) = 5 - x^7$**\n    This function can be split into an even part ($5$) and an odd part ($-x^7$).\n    *   The constant $5$ is a polynomial of degree 0. Since $0 \\le 5$, it is exactly integrated by the 3-point formula.\n    *   The term $-x^7$ is an odd polynomial of degree 7. For an odd function $g(x)$ over a symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$, $\\int_{-1}^1 g(x) dx = 0$. The 3-point Gauss formula has symmetric nodes ($x_1=0, x_2=-x_3$) and symmetric weights ($A_2=A_3$). For an odd function $g(x)$, $g(0)=0$ and $g(-x_3) = -g(x_3)$. Thus, the approximation is $A_1 g(x_1) + A_2 g(x_2) + A_3 g(x_3) = A_1 g(0) + A_2 g(-x_3) + A_3 g(x_3) = A_1(0) + A_2(-g(x_3)) + A_3(g(x_3)) = (-A_2+A_3)g(x_3)$. Since $A_2=A_3$, this sum is $0$. Therefore, the odd part $-x^7$ is also exactly integrated to $0$. \n    *   Since both parts are exactly integrated, $f(x) = 5 - x^7$ is exactly integrated.\n\n2.  **Option B: $f(x) = 2 + 3x + 6x^4$**\n    This is a polynomial of degree 4. Since $4 \\le 5$, it is exactly integrated by the 3-point formula.\n\n3.  **Option C: $f(x) = 13 + 6x^3 + x^6$**\n    This function contains the term $x^6$, which is an even polynomial of degree 6. Since $6 > 5$, this term is not guaranteed to be exactly integrated. Let's verify:\n    *   True integral of $x^6$ over $[-1, 1]$: $\\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx = [\\frac{x^7}{7}]_{-1}^1 = \\frac{1}{7} - (-\\frac{1}{7}) = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n    *   Gauss approximation for $x^6$: $A_1(0)^6 + A_2(- \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}})^6 + A_3(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}})^6 = 0 + \\frac{5}{9}(\\frac{3}{5})^3 + \\frac{5}{9}(\\frac{3}{5})^3 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{125} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{25} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{25} = \\frac{6}{25}$.\n    *   Since $\\frac{2}{7} \\ne \\frac{6}{25}$, $x^6$ is not exactly integrated. Therefore, $f(x) = 13 + 6x^3 + x^6$ is not exactly integrated.\n\n4.  **Option D: $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$**\n    This is not a polynomial. Gauss Quadrature is designed to exactly integrate polynomials up to a certain degree, and approximates other functions. Thus, it is not exactly integrated.\n\nBoth options A and B are exactly integrated by the given 3-point Gaussian formula."
