For n=3, this means exact for polynomials up to degree 5. However, due to symmetry of the nodes and weights, it can also exactly integrate some specific higher-degree polynomials, particularly those where the odd-degree terms are odd functions (integral zero) and the rule handles the even part correctly. We verify each option: A) f(x)=5-x^7 is degree 7, but its integral is 10. The quadrature sum yields exactly 10 because the x^7 term is odd and integrates to zero exactly with symmetric rule, and the constant 5 is integrated exactly. B) f(x)=2+3x+6x^4 is degree 4 ≤ 5, so guaranteed exact. C) f(x)=13+6x^3+x^6 is degree 6. The rule is not exact for all degree 6 polynomials. Computing the true integral (184/7) and quadrature sum (1968/75) shows they are not equal. D) f(x)=e^{-x^2} is not a polynomial, so not exactly integrated. Thus, only A and B are exactly integrated."

          "Step 2: Analyze Option A: f(x)=5-x^7 (degree 7). True integral I_A = \\int_{-1}^{1} (5-x^7) dx = 10. Compute quadrature: Q_A = (8/9)*f(0) + (5/9)*[f(-\\sqrt{3/5}) + f(\\sqrt{3/5})]. Since x^7 is odd, f(-\\sqrt{3/5}) + f(\\sqrt{3/5}) = (5 + (3/5)^{7/2}) + (5 - (3/5)^{7/2}) = 10. Thus Q_A = (8/9)*5 + (5/9)*10 = 40/9 + 50/9 = 10 = I_A. So exact.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Option B: f(x)=2+3x+6x^4 (degree 4 ≤ 5). By the theoretical guarantee, it must be exactly integrated. One can verify: I_B = \\int_{-1}^{1} (2+3x+6x^4) dx = 4 + 0 + 12/5 = 32/5 = 6.4. Quadrature gives the same.",

This is directly applicable to understanding the 3-point rule. Chunks 2, 4, 5, 6 were about Gaussian integral, Cauchy principal value, influence coefficients, and Gamma function, which are not directly relevant to this specific question on Gauss-Legendre quadrature exactness. Thus, internal knowledge was used to extend the concept to 3-point rule and verify exactness for the given functions."
