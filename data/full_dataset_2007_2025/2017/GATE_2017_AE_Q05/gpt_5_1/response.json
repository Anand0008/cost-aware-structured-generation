        "reasoning": "An n-point Gauss-Legendre rule on [-1,1] is exact for all polynomials up to degree 2n-1. For 3-point, that degree is 2·3-1 = 5. Therefore any polynomial whose highest power of x is ≤ 5 will be integrated exactly; if the highest power is ≥ 6, it will in general not be exact.\n\nCheck each option:\nA) f(x) = 5 - x^7 has degree 7 (>5). However, Gauss-Legendre rules are exact for all polynomials up to degree 2n-1, and may accidentally be exact for some higher-degree polynomials if the higher-degree part integrates to zero under the quadrature. Here, the constant 5 is always integrated exactly. The x^7 term is odd, and the 3-point rule is symmetric about 0 with nodes {0, ±a} and equal weights for ±a. For any odd function g(x), the contributions at ±a cancel and g(0)=0, so the quadrature gives 0 for the odd part, which matches the true integral of x^7 over [-1,1]. Thus the rule is exact for 5 - x^7.\nB) f(x) = 2 + 3x + 6x^4 is a polynomial of degree 4 (≤5), so by theory the 3-point Gauss-Legendre rule is guaranteed to be exact.\nC) f(x) = 13 + 6x^3 + x^6 has degree 6 (>5). The constant and x^3 (odd) parts are integrated exactly (same symmetry argument), but the x^6 term (even, degree 6) is not guaranteed to be exact and in fact is not. Direct check: true integral of x^6 from -1 to 1 is 2/7. Quadrature gives A1·0^6 + A2·a^6 + A3·(-a)^6 = (5/9+5/9)a^6 = (10/9)(3/5)^3 = 2/5 ≠ 2/7, so not exact.\nD) f(x) = e^{-x^2} is not a polynomial, so the finite-degree exactness theorem does not apply; the rule is approximate only.\nHence only A and B are exactly integrated, matching the official key."

Although the question is about 3-point quadrature, the same principle (exact for degree 2N−1) directly generalizes, so the context was moderately helpful. Other chunks on Gaussian integrals and complex analysis were not directly relevant."
