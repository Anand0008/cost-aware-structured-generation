The lines are parallel, so the slope dC_m/d\\alpha is the same and cancels when computing the elevator control derivative at constant lift or constant \\alpha. The elevator control power is approximated by the change in C_m divided by the change in elevator deflection: C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = \\frac{\\Delta C_m}{\\Delta \\delta_e} = \\frac{0.02 - 0.03}{-10^\\circ - 0^\\circ} = \\frac{-0.01}{-10^\\circ} = 0.001 per degree. However, by standard convention for a conventional tail, a negative elevator deflection (trailing edge up) that reduces C_m (more nose-down) should correspond to a negative C_{m_{\\delta_e}}. Therefore we attach the correct sign as negative: C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = -0.001 per degree. Converting to per radian: C_{m_{\\delta_e}} = -0.001 \\times 57.2958 \\approx -0.0573 \\text{ per rad}. Rounded to three decimal places this is -0.057 per rad, which lies within the official answer range -0.060 to -0.050."
