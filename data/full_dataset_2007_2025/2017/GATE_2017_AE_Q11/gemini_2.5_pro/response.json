        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements about the shear center. Let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement P: It is that point in the cross-section through which shear loads produce no twisting.**\nThis is the fundamental definition of the shear center. As stated in RAG Chunks 2, 3, 5, and 6, the shear center is the specific point where a transverse shear force can be applied without inducing any twisting (torsion) in the beam. If the load is applied elsewhere, it will cause both bending and twisting. Therefore, statement P is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement Q: This point is also the centre of twist of sections subjected to pure torsion.**\nFor thin-walled open sections, the shear center is indeed the point about which the cross-section rotates when subjected to pure torsion. This means that the axis of twist passes through the shear center. If a torque is applied such that its axis coincides with the shear center, the beam will undergo pure torsion without any bending. This concept is closely related to the definition of the shear center as the point where shear loads cause no twisting. Therefore, statement Q is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement R: The normal stress at this point is always zero.**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. RAG Chunk 1 clarifies that the neutral axis is the locus of points where the normal stress due to *bending* is zero. The shear center and the neutral axis are generally distinct points. They only coincide for cross-sections that possess at least one axis of symmetry (and the shear center lies on that axis). Furthermore, even if the shear center happens to be on the neutral axis, normal stress can still exist at that point if there is an axial force applied to the beam (e.g., `$\\sigma = P/A$`). The statement 'always zero' makes it definitively false.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements P and Q are true, while statement R is false. Thus, option C is the correct answer."

          "Step 2: Evaluate Statement P. Statement P directly aligns with the definition of the shear center. Applying a shear load through this point ensures pure bending without twisting. Thus, P is true.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Statement Q. For thin-walled open sections, the shear center is also the center of twist. When a beam is subjected to pure torsion, it twists about an axis that passes through the shear center. Thus, Q is true.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Statement R. The neutral axis is the line where normal stress due to bending is zero. The shear center and the neutral axis are generally different points. They only coincide for sections with at least one axis of symmetry. Moreover, normal stress can also arise from axial forces, which would not be zero at the shear center even if it coincided with the neutral axis. Therefore, the normal stress at the shear center is not 'always' zero, making R false.",
          "Step 5: Combine the evaluations. Since P and Q are true and R is false, the correct option is the one that includes P and Q only."
