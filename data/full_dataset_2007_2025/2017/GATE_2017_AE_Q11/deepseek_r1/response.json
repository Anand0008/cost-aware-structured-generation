For thin-walled open sections (common in aerospace structures), the shear centre is also the centre of twist, meaning under pure torsion, the section twists about this point. This is a standard result in aircraft structures theory. However, for general solid sections, they may differ, but in GATE AE context, Q is considered true for typical sections.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement R. Normal stress at a point depends on bending moments and axial forces, not on the shear centre location. Under bending, normal stress is zero only on the neutral axis, which may not coincide with the shear centre. For example, in an asymmetric section under bending, normal stress at the shear centre can be non-zero. Thus, R is false.",
