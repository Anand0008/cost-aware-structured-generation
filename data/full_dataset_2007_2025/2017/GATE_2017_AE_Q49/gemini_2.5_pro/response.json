        "notes": "RAG provided the exact Tsiolkovsky rocket equation and a worked example (Chunk 1), which was highly relevant for the calculation. It also offered excellent conceptual context on single-stage rocket limitations and the importance of mass ratio (Chunks 4, 5, 6). Chunk 2 discussed orbital velocity, which is related but not directly the escape velocity asked for, but still provided useful context on velocity requirements for space missions. Overall, the RAG context was very helpful and directly supported the solution and educational analysis."
