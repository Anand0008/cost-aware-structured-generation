Chunk 2 (video) discussed orbital velocity and single-stage limitations. Chunks 4 and 5 (Gas_Turbines) explained the rocket equation and mass ratio limitations. Chunk 6 (Sutton) also mentioned rocket equation. However, none explicitly solved for propellant mass given escape velocity, so the specific calculation relied on internal knowledge. Overall, RAG context was helpful for principles and context."

Consider ge = 9.8 m/s^2. If the atmospheric drag and effect of gravity are to be neglected, the mass of propellant to be carried by the rocket is equal to ________ kg (in one decimal place)."
