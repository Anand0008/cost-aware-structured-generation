First find A x: A x = \\begin{bmatrix}2x_1 - 6x_2 \\\\ 2x_2\\end{bmatrix}. Then K = x^T (A x) = [x_1 \\ x_2] \\begin{bmatrix}2x_1 - 6x_2 \\\\ 2x_2\\end{bmatrix} = x_1(2x_1 - 6x_2) + x_2(2x_2) = 2x_1^2 - 6x_1 x_2 + 2x_2^2. This is a quadratic form in (x_1, x_2). To see its possible signs, test specific non-trivial vectors: (1) x = [1 \\ 0] gives K = 2(1)^2 - 6(1)(0) + 2(0)^2 = 2 > 0. (2) x = [0 \\ 1] gives K = 2(0)^2 - 6(0)(1) + 2(1)^2 = 2 > 0. (3) x = [1 \\ 1] gives K = 2 - 6 + 2 = -2 < 0. Thus K can be positive for some non-trivial x and negative for others, so it is not always < 0, not always > 0, and not guaranteed non-negative.
