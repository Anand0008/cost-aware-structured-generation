Given q0 l = 10W, substituting q0 = 10W/l yields δ = (10W/l) * l^4/(8EI) - W l^3/(3EI) = W l^3/EI * (10/8 - 1/3) = W l^3/EI * (5/4 - 1/3) = W l^3/EI * (11/12) ≈ W l^3/EI * 0.9167.

Chunks 1 and 4 discuss simply supported beam deflection and flexural rigidity, which are related but not directly applicable. Chunk 5 shows a cantilever thermal deflection example using integration, which is methodologically similar. I relied on internal knowledge for the specific cantilever deflection formulas and superposition principle."

Flexural rigidity = EI and q0 l = 10 W. The upward deflection of the tip of the aircraft wing under the given loading can be expressed as delta = k W l^3 / EI. The value of k is ________ (in three decimal places)."
