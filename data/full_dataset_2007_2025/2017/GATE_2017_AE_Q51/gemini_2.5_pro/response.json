          "Step 3: Recall the standard formula for the tip deflection of a cantilever beam due to a uniformly distributed load 'w' over its entire length. This deflection is $\\delta_w = \\frac{w L^4}{8 EI}$ (downward). Apply this for the UDL 'q0', noting it acts upwards.",

However, they did not directly provide the standard, fundamental formulas for cantilever beam tip deflection due to point loads or UDLs, which were essential for solving this specific problem. I relied on internal knowledge for these core formulas."
