        "reasoning": "The wing is modeled as a cantilever beam of length l with a downward tip load W and an upward uniformly distributed load q_0 such that q_0 l = 10 W. Taking downward deflection as positive, the standard tip deflection of a cantilever under a downward end load W is \\(\\delta_W = W l^3 / (3 EI)\\). For an upward UDL q_0, the tip deflection is \\(\\delta_{q_0} = - q_0 l^4 / (8 EI)\\) (negative because it is upward). Substituting q_0 l = 10 W gives \\(\\delta_{q_0} = - 10 W l^3 / (8 EI) = -1.25 W l^3 / (EI)\\). The net (downward) tip deflection is \\(\\delta = \\delta_W + \\delta_{q_0} = (1/3 - 5/4) W l^3 / EI = -11/12 \\; W l^3 / EI\\). The magnitude of the upward deflection is therefore \\(|\\delta| = (11/12) W l^3 / EI\\). Comparing with \\(\\delta = k W l^3 / EI\\) (upward deflection), we get \\(k = 11/12 = 0.916\\overline{6} \\approx 0.917\\), which lies in the official answer range 0.910 to 0.920."
