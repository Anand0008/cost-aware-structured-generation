        "reasoning": "The maximum normal stress is calculated using the principles of unsymmetrical bending. The applied moment $M_o$ is resolved into components $M_x = M_o \\cos(45^\\circ)$ and $M_y = M_o \\sin(45^\\circ)$ about the principal axes (x and y for a square section). The moment of inertia $I$ for the thin-walled hollow square section is calculated as $I = (D^4 - d^4) / 12$, where $D$ is the outer dimension and $d$ is the inner dimension. The normal stress at any point $(x, y)$ is given by $\\sigma_z = (M_y x / I_y) - (M_x y / I_x)$. For a square section, $I_x = I_y = I$. The maximum stress occurs at the corners of the square cross-section, specifically at $(c, -c)$ or $(-c, c)$, where $c = D/2$ is the distance to the extreme fiber. Substituting these values into the stress formula, the magnitude of the maximum stress simplifies to $\\sigma_{max} = (M_x + M_y) c / I = (\\sqrt{2} M_o c) / I$. With $D = 0.12 \\text{ m}$, $t = 0.001 \\text{ m}$, $d = 0.118 \\text{ m}$, $M_o = 96 \\text{ Nm}$, and $c = 0.06 \\text{ m}$, the calculated moment of inertia is $I = 1.1235 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4$. Plugging these values into the maximum stress formula yields $\\sigma_{max} = 7.250 \\text{ MN/m}^2$. This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 6.900 to 7.400."

          "Step 1: Identify Given Data and Convert Units. The outer dimension $D = 120 \\text{ mm} = 0.12 \\text{ m}$, wall thickness $t = 1 \\text{ mm} = 0.001 \\text{ m}$, and applied moment $M_o = 96 \\text{ Nm}$.",
          "Step 2: Calculate Inner Dimension. The inner side of the square cross-section is $d = D - 2t = 120 - 2(1) = 118 \\text{ mm} = 0.118 \\text{ m}$.",
          "Step 3: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I). For a hollow square section, the moment of inertia about the centroidal x or y axis is $I = (D^4 - d^4) / 12$. Substituting the dimensions in meters: $I = ((0.12)^4 - (0.118)^4) / 12 = 1.1235 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4$.",
          "Step 4: Decompose the Applied Moment. Resolve the resultant moment $M_o$ into components about the principal axes (x and y axes). Given the angle of $45^\\circ$ with the x-axis, $M_x = M_o \\cos(45^\\circ) = 96 \\times (1/\\sqrt{2}) = 67.882 \\text{ Nm}$ and $M_y = M_o \\sin(45^\\circ) = 96 \\times (1/\\sqrt{2}) = 67.882 \\text{ Nm}$.",
          "Step 5: Apply Unsymmetrical Bending Stress Formula. The normal stress $\\sigma_z$ at any point $(x, y)$ in the cross-section due to bending about both x and y axes is $\\sigma_z = (M_y x / I_y) - (M_x y / I_x)$. Since $I_x = I_y = I$ for a square section, this simplifies to $\\sigma_z = (M_y x - M_x y) / I$.",
          "Step 6: Determine Location of Maximum Stress. The maximum normal stress occurs at the extreme fibers, specifically at the corners of the square cross-section. The distance from the centroid to the extreme fiber is $c = D/2 = 0.12 \\text{ m} / 2 = 0.06 \\text{ m}$. The maximum stress magnitude will occur at the corners $(c, -c)$ or $(-c, c)$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate Maximum Stress. Substitute the values of $M_x$, $M_y$, $c$, and $I$ into the simplified stress formula. For example, at $(c, -c)$: $\\sigma_{max} = (M_y c - M_x (-c)) / I = (M_y c + M_x c) / I = (M_x + M_y) c / I$. Since $M_x = M_y = M_o/\\sqrt{2}$, this simplifies to $\\sigma_{max} = (\\sqrt{2} M_o c) / I$.",
          "Step 8: Final Calculation and Units. $\\sigma_{max} = (\\sqrt{2} \\times 96 \\text{ Nm} \\times 0.06 \\text{ m}) / (1.1235 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4) = 7250390.6 \\text{ Pa} = 7.250 \\text{ MN/m}^2$ (to three decimal places)."

        "notes": "RAG chunks 1, 2, and 3 provided relevant information on the flexure formula, moment of inertia calculation for rectangular sections, and general concepts of thin-walled beams. While not explicitly covering unsymmetrical bending in detail, the foundational formulas and concepts were present and helpful. The other chunks were less relevant, focusing on shear and warping torsion."
