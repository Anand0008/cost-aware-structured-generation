Thus, $\\omega_{d1} = 10\\pi \\sqrt{1-0.04} = 10\\pi \\sqrt{0.96}$. Case 2 (Coulomb/frictional damping): For a spring-mass system with dry friction on a surface, the frequency of oscillation during free vibration remains the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n$, provided the restoring force (spring) is linear and friction only causes constant amplitude decay per cycle. The 'damped natural frequency' in this context is simply $\\omega_{d2} = \\omega_n = 10\\pi$ rad/s. The ratio is therefore $\\omega_{d1} / \\omega_{d2} = \\sqrt{0.96} \\approx 0.979795...$, which rounds to 0.980 (three decimal places). This matches the provided answer key range of 0.970 to 0.990."

However, none of the chunks discussed Coulomb (dry friction) damping or its effect on oscillation frequency. Therefore, the solution for Case 2 relied entirely on internal knowledge. The RAG context was partially helpful for the viscous damping part but silent on the key conceptual distinction required for the problem."
