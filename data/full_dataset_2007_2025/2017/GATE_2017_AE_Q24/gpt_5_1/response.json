However, the question does not specify amplitude or normal force, so the intended GATE simplification is that the friction is very small ($\\mu=0.01$) and its effect on the natural frequency is negligible. Thus, the damped natural frequency in Case 2 is taken approximately equal to the undamped natural frequency: $\\omega_{d2} \\approx \\omega_n = 10\\pi\\,\\text{rad/s}$.\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio of damped natural frequencies (Case 1 / Case 2) is\\n$$R = \\frac{\\omega_{d1}}{\\omega_{d2}} = \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} = \\sqrt{0.96} \\approx 0.98.$$\\nThis lies within the official answer range 0.970 to 0.990, so the key is consistent with the standard viscous-damping formula and the assumption that small dry friction does not significantly shift the natural frequency."

It did not directly address Coulomb friction damping, so the treatment of Case 2 relied on internal knowledge and standard approximations. Overall, RAG was helpful for the viscous damping part and general SDOF vibration context."
