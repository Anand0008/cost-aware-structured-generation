This must be corrected for a finite wing using the given span effectiveness factor (e) and aspect ratio (AR). The formula from finite wing theory gives the finite wing lift slope (a). Using this slope and the angle of attack (with zero-lift angle = 0° for symmetric NACA 0012), the lift coefficient CL is calculated. The computed value of ~0.544 falls within the official answer key range of 0.540 to 0.550."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the governing theory and parameters. The flow is incompressible and governed by thin airfoil theory. The airfoil is NACA 0012 (symmetric). The wing is rectangular with aspect ratio AR = 10 and span effectiveness factor e = 0.95. Angle of attack α = 6°.",
          "Step 2: Recall the lift slope for a 2D airfoil (infinite wing) from thin airfoil theory. For any symmetric airfoil, thin airfoil theory predicts a lift slope a0 = 2π per radian.",
          "Step 3: Convert the 2D lift slope to per degree for easier calculation with the given angle in degrees. a0 (per radian) = 2π ≈ 6.2832 rad⁻¹. a0 (per degree) = a0 (per radian) * (π/180) ≈ 6.2832 * (π/180) ≈ 0.1097 deg⁻¹. (Alternatively, the standard conversion factor is 0.10966 deg⁻¹). More precisely, a0 = (2π) * (180/π)⁻¹ = 2π * (1/(180/π)) = 2π * (π/180) = 2π²/180 ≈ 0.10966 per degree.",
          "Step 4: Apply the finite wing correction to find the finite wing lift slope (a). The formula for a finite wing (from Prandtl's lifting line theory) is: a = a0 / [1 + (a0/(π * e * AR))]. Note: a0 in the formula must be in per radian. Let's use a0 in per radian for consistency. a0_rad = 2π. AR = 10, e = 0.95. Calculate denominator term: (a0_rad) / (π * e * AR) = (2π) / (π * 0.95 * 10) = 2 / (9.5) ≈ 0.210526. Then, a_rad = 2π / (1 + 0.210526) ≈ 6.2832 / 1.210526 ≈ 5.188 per radian.",
          "Step 5: Convert the finite wing lift slope to per degree for use with α in degrees. a_deg = a_rad * (π/180) ≈ 5.188 * (π/180) ≈ 0.09055 per degree. (Alternatively, use the formula directly with a0 in per degree: a_deg = a0_deg / [1 + (57.3 * a0_deg)/(π * e * AR)], where 57.3 ≈ 180/π. This yields the same result).",
          "Step 6: Calculate the lift coefficient CL. For a symmetric airfoil, the zero-lift angle of attack α_L=0 = 0°. CL = a * (α - α_L=0). Using a in per degree: CL = 0.09055 * (6° - 0°) ≈ 0.5433. Using a in per radian and α in radians (α_rad = 6 * π/180 ≈ 0.10472 rad): CL = a_rad * α_rad ≈ 5.188 * 0.10472 ≈ 0.5433. Rounding to three decimal places gives 0.543. Considering more precise calculation: a0 = 2π exactly, AR=10, e=0.95. CL = (2π * (π/30)) / (1 + 2/(9.5)) = (2π²/30) / (23/19) = (38π²)/(690). With π²≈9.8696044, CL = (38*9.8696044)/690 ≈ 375.0449672/690 ≈ 0.54354. Rounding to three decimals: 0.544."

The examples used specific airfoils (NACA 23012, Clark Y) and gave the finite wing lift slope formula, which is directly applicable. However, none of the chunks explicitly stated the thin airfoil theory result a0=2π per radian for a symmetric airfoil, which is a key piece of information for this specific problem. This had to be supplied from internal knowledge. The RAG context was highly relevant for the methodology but missed the specific theoretical input value."
