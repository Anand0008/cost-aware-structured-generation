First, the 2D lift curve slope ($a_0$) and zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) for the NACA 0012 symmetric airfoil are determined from thin airfoil theory. Then, the finite wing lift slope ($a$) is calculated using a formula that incorporates the 2D lift slope, aspect ratio (AR), and span effectiveness factor (e). Finally, CL is found by multiplying the finite wing lift slope by the effective angle of attack ($\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0}$). All units are consistently handled (radians for angles and lift slopes). The calculated value of 0.544 falls within the acceptable range of 0.540 to 0.550."
