Spar flanges are the primary components that resist bending moments in the wing. They experience large axial compressive and tensile forces.\n2. For a tapered spar, the inclined flanges produce vertical force components that assist the web in resisting the upward shear force.\n3. However, slender spar flanges are susceptible to buckling, which is a critical failure mode for compression-dominated members.\n\nTherefore, the top spar cap/flange, being a slender compression member, is most likely to fail by buckling rather than yielding, crushing, or creep."
