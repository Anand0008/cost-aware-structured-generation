The top spar cap (flange) is therefore a long, slender compression member running along the span. For such members, the dominant and most likely failure mode is elastic or inelastic buckling, not material yielding or crushing, because the compressive stress at buckling is usually well below the yield stress. Creep is associated with high temperature and long-term loading, which is not critical for typical metallic wing spars in normal flight. Hence, buckling is the most likely failure mode."
