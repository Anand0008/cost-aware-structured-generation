        "reasoning": "When an aircraft is flying straight, the wings generate lift, which creates an upward bending moment on the wing structure. This bending moment causes the top surface of the wing, including the top spar cap/flange, to be subjected to compressive stresses. The bottom spar cap/flange, conversely, experiences tensile stresses. Spar caps are typically designed as slender members to minimize weight. Slender members under compression are highly susceptible to buckling, which is a form of structural instability where the member suddenly deforms laterally at a critical load, often well before the material's yield strength is reached (as explained in CHUNK 2 and CHUNK 3). Yielding or crushing (Options A and C) would occur if the compressive stress reached the material's yield or ultimate compressive strength, but for slender members, buckling usually precedes these material failures. Creep (Option D) is a time-dependent deformation under sustained load, typically at elevated temperatures, and is not the most likely immediate failure mode under normal flight conditions."

          "Step 1: Identify the component and its function. The question refers to the 'top spar cap / flange of a wing'. As per CHUNK 4, spar flanges are primary load-carrying members resisting bending moments.",
          "Step 2: Determine the loading condition. The aircraft is 'flying straight', which means the wing is generating lift. This lift creates an upward bending moment on the wing structure.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the stress state in the top spar cap due to this loading. For an upward bending moment, the top surface of the wing (and thus the top spar cap) is subjected to compressive stresses, while the bottom spar cap is under tension.",
          "Step 4: Recall common failure modes for structural members under compressive loads. Members under compression can fail by yielding/crushing (material failure) or by buckling (stability failure).",
          "Step 5: Consider the geometry and typical design of spar caps. Spar caps are generally long and relatively thin (slender) elements, designed to be lightweight yet strong.",
          "Step 6: Compare buckling, yielding, and crushing for slender members. As discussed in CHUNK 2 and CHUNK 3, buckling is a critical failure mode for slender compression members, occurring as a sudden lateral deflection at a critical load that can be significantly lower than the load required to cause material yielding or crushing. For slender aircraft components, buckling is often the primary design driver and the most likely failure mode.",
          "Step 7: Eliminate other options. Yielding and crushing are material failures that typically occur after buckling in slender members. Creep is a time-dependent deformation at elevated temperatures and is not the most likely immediate failure mode under typical flight conditions."
