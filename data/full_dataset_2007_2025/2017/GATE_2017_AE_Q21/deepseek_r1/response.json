        "reasoning": "During straight flight, the wing experiences an upward bending moment due to lift. The top spar cap/flange is in axial compression. Spar caps are typically slender members (long relative to cross-sectional dimensions). For slender compression members, the primary failure mode is elastic buckling (instability) at a load lower than the crushing/yield load. This is a fundamental concept in aircraft structures, supported by the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 2, 3, 4, 6) which classify long columns as failing by buckling. Yielding (A) and crushing (C) are material failure modes typical for short, stocky columns. Creep (D) is time-dependent deformation under constant load, typically significant at high temperatures, not the dominant failure mode for a wing spar under normal flight conditions."
