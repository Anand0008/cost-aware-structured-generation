        "reasoning": "The natural frequency of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) undamped spring-mass system is given by $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k_{eq}/m}$, where $k_{eq}$ is the equivalent stiffness of the system. In this problem, the mass 'm' is suspended by two identical springs, each with stiffness 'k', making an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the horizontal. When the mass is displaced vertically by a small amount 'x', each spring stretches by a component of 'x' along its axis, and the restoring force is the sum of the vertical components of the spring forces. For small displacements, the extension of each spring in the vertical direction is $x \\sin(45^\\circ)$. The vertical restoring force from each spring is $k (x \\sin(45^\\circ)) \\sin(45^\\circ) = kx \\sin^2(45^\\circ)$. Since there are two such springs, the total equivalent stiffness $k_{eq} = 2k \\sin^2(45^\\circ)$. Given $\\sin(45^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, then $\\sin^2(45^\\circ) = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$. Therefore, $k_{eq} = 2k (1/2) = k$. Substituting this into the natural frequency formula, $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$. Comparing this with the given form $\\omega_n = a \\sqrt{k/m}$, we find that $a = 1$. The calculated value of 'a' falls within the specified range of 0.95 to 1.05."

          "Step 2: Consider a small vertical downward displacement 'x' of the mass from its equilibrium position. Due to this displacement, each spring will experience an extension.",
          "Step 3: Determine the effective extension of each spring. For a small vertical displacement 'x' and an angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ with the horizontal, the component of this displacement along the axis of each spring is $x \\sin(\\theta)$. This is the stretch in each spring.",
          "Step 4: Calculate the restoring force from each spring. The force developed in each spring is $F_s = k \\times (x \\sin(\\theta))$. The vertical component of this force, which contributes to the restoring force on the mass, is $F_{s,vertical} = F_s \\sin(\\theta) = k (x \\sin(\\theta)) \\sin(\\theta) = kx \\sin^2(\\theta)$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the total equivalent stiffness ($k_{eq}$). Since there are two identical springs acting symmetrically, the total vertical restoring force is $F_{total} = 2 \\times F_{s,vertical} = 2kx \\sin^2(\\theta)$. By definition, $F_{total} = k_{eq}x$, so $k_{eq} = 2k \\sin^2(\\theta)$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the given angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$. We know that $\\sin(45^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $\\sin^2(45^\\circ) = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of $k_{eq}$. $k_{eq} = 2k (1/2) = k$.",
          "Step 8: Write the equation of motion for the system using Newton's Second Law: $m \\ddot{x} + k_{eq}x = 0$. Substituting $k_{eq} = k$, we get $m \\ddot{x} + kx = 0$.",
          "Step 9: Determine the natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$) from the equation of motion. The standard form is $\\ddot{x} + \\omega_n^2 x = 0$, so $\\omega_n^2 = k_{eq}/m$. Thus, $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k_{eq}/m}$.",
          "Step 10: Substitute the calculated $k_{eq}$ into the natural frequency formula: $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$.",

However, the specific derivation for inclined springs and force resolution was not explicitly detailed in the provided chunks, requiring internal knowledge for that part of the solution. The RAG context was helpful for validating the final formula and understanding the core concepts."
