To ensure this rule is being followed, we must check for potential violations. A violation occurs if someone is drinking beer AND is 18 years old or younger.\n\nLet's analyze each person:\n1.  **P is 16 years old**: P is underage (age $\\le$ 18). According to the rule, P must NOT be drinking beer. Therefore, we must check **P's drink** to ensure it's not beer.\n2.  **Q is 25 years old**: Q is over 18. The rule places no restrictions on what people over 18 can drink. Whether Q drinks beer or a milkshake, Q is not violating the age condition. So, **Q's drink** does not need to be checked.\n3.  **R is drinking milkshake**: R is not drinking beer. The rule only applies to those who are drinking beer. Therefore, **R's age** is irrelevant to checking this specific rule.\n4.  **S is drinking a beer**: S is drinking beer. According to the rule, S must be over 18. Therefore, we must check **S's age** to ensure it's greater than 18.\n\nCombining these necessary checks, we must check P's drink and S's age. This corresponds to option B."
