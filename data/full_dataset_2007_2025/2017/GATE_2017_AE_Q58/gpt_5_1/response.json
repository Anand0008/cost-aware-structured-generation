To check whether the rule is being followed, we must look for possible violations of this implication, i.e., cases where someone is drinking beer AND is under 18. We do NOT need to check people who are over 18 and what they are drinking, because the rule does not restrict what adults drink. We also do not need to check the age of those who are clearly not drinking beer (e.g., drinking milkshake), because the rule only applies when the drink is beer. Among the four people:\n- P: 16 years old (under 18). To see if P violates the rule, we must check whether P is drinking beer. So we must check P's drink.\n- Q: 25 years old (over 18). Whatever Q is drinking, the rule is automatically satisfied; no check needed.\n- R: drinking milkshake (not beer). The rule does not apply; no need to check R's age.\n- S: drinking beer. To ensure the rule is followed, we must check that S is over 18, so we must check S's age.\nThus, the minimum necessary checks are P's drink and S's age. This corresponds to option B."
