        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C, 'the tendency of rudder to float rapidly at high angles of side-slip'. This is the primary cause of the phenomenon of 'rudder lock' in conventional low-speed aircraft. When the aircraft experiences high sideslip angles, the rudder tends to float rapidly, making it difficult for the pilot to control the aircraft's yaw. This is due to the aerodynamic forces acting on the rudder at high sideslip angles, which can lead to a loss of directional control. The other options are not the primary cause of rudder lock - large `C_n_beta` (A) and sidewash effects (B and D) can contribute to directional stability issues, but they are not the direct cause of rudder lock."
