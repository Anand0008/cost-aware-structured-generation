        "reasoning": "Rudder lock is an aerodynamic phenomenon where the rudder, once deflected to a large angle, tends to remain in that position, making it difficult for the pilot to return it to neutral. This occurs when the aerodynamic hinge moment on the rudder, which normally acts to restore the rudder to a neutral position, either reverses its sign or significantly reduces its restoring capability at large deflection angles or high sideslip angles. This tendency for the rudder to 'float' to a large angle and get 'locked' there is precisely what option C describes: 'the tendency of rudder to float rapidly at high angles of side-slip'.\n\nOptions A, B, and D relate to the overall directional stability of the aircraft (`C_n_beta`) or the effects of sidewash on the vertical stabilizer. While these are related to directional flight, they do not directly explain the specific control surface phenomenon of rudder lock. Rudder lock is a local aerodynamic issue concerning the rudder's hinge moment characteristics, not the aircraft's overall directional stability derivative or the general effect of sidewash on the tailplane."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the term 'rudder lock'. Rudder lock is a condition where the rudder, once deflected to a significant angle (often due to a large sideslip or pilot input), becomes aerodynamically 'locked' in that position, making it difficult for the pilot to move it back to neutral.",
          "Step 2: Recall the aerodynamic forces acting on a control surface. A control surface (like a rudder) experiences aerodynamic forces that create a hinge moment about its pivot axis. For normal operation, this hinge moment should provide a restoring force that tends to bring the control surface back to neutral or allow the pilot to easily move it.",
          "Step 3: Identify the cause of rudder lock. Rudder lock occurs when the aerodynamic hinge moment characteristics of the rudder change at large deflection angles. Specifically, at high angles of sideslip or large rudder deflections, the hinge moment can become such that it drives the rudder further into the deflection, or at least does not provide a strong restoring force. This is often described as the rudder 'floating' to a large deflection angle.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the given options in light of this understanding. Option C, 'the tendency of rudder to float rapidly at high angles of side-slip', directly describes this aerodynamic behavior of the rudder itself. The 'floating' implies the rudder is driven by aerodynamic forces to a large angle, and 'rapidly' suggests a strong, potentially uncontrollable, aerodynamic moment.",
          "Step 5: Dismiss other options. Options A, B, and D relate to the overall directional stability derivative (`C_n_beta`) or the effects of sidewash on the vertical stabilizer. While these are important for overall aircraft directional stability (as discussed in RAG chunks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), they do not explain the specific phenomenon of a control surface becoming 'locked' due to its own hinge moment characteristics. Rudder lock is a control surface design issue, not a general aircraft stability issue."
