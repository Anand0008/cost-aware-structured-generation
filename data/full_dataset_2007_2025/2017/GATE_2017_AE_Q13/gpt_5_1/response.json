        "reasoning": "Rudder lock is a lateral-directional control problem seen in conventional low-speed aircraft at high sideslip angles. At large \\(\\beta\\), the aerodynamic hinge moment on the rudder can change sign or grow so strongly that the rudder tends to float to a deflected position and becomes very hard or impossible to move back with pilot input. This is called 'rudder lock' or 'rudder overbalance'. The key is the tendency of the rudder to float rapidly at high sideslip, i.e., option C.\n\nOption A: A large positive \\(C_N_\\beta\\) means strong directional static stability (weathercock stability), but by itself it does not cause rudder lock; it just makes the aircraft strongly align with the wind.\n\nOption B and D: Sidewash from fuselage or wing on the vertical tail affects the effective sideslip at the tail and thus \\(C_N_\\beta\\), but they are secondary geometric/flow effects, not the primary mechanism of rudder lock. Rudder lock is fundamentally about hinge-moment behavior and control surface floating at high \\(\\beta\\).\n\nTherefore, the official answer C correctly identifies the primary cause."

          "Step 2: Link this to hinge moment behavior. At large \\(\\beta\\), the pressure distribution on the rudder can create a large hinge moment that drives the rudder toward a floating position, overpowering pilot input.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate option C: 'tendency of rudder to float rapidly at high angles of side-slip' directly describes this hinge-moment-driven floating and locking behavior, so it matches the definition.",
          "Step 4: Check option A: 'large value of \\(C_n_\\beta\\)' refers to strong directional static stability (weathercock stability). This affects yaw response but not specifically the rudder hinge moment or locking.",
          "Step 5: Check options B and D: sidewash from fuselage or wing modifies the effective sideslip at the vertical tail and hence its contribution to \\(C_N_\\beta\\), but these are not the primary cause of the rudder becoming stuck or locked.",

This was helpful to eliminate options A, B, and D by clarifying what $C_N_\\beta$ and sidewash represent. However, RAG did not explicitly discuss 'rudder lock' or hinge-moment-driven rudder floating, so the core explanation for option C relied on internal knowledge of flight stability and control."
