        "reasoning": "Rudder lock is a phenomenon where, at high sideslip angles ($\\beta$), the aerodynamic hinge moment on the rudder increases dramatically, causing the rudder to 'float' or deflect to its maximum limit. This rapid floating (or 'blowback') at high $\\beta$ overwhelms pilot control inputs, effectively locking the rudder. While options B and D (sidewash effects) and A (large $C_{n_\\beta}$) influence the aircraft's directional stability and tail effectiveness, they are not the primary, direct cause of the rudder locking. The key mechanism is the rudder's own aerodynamic imbalance and hinge moment characteristics at high sideslip."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the phenomenon. 'Rudder lock' refers to a condition where the pilot loses the ability to center the rudder because aerodynamic forces on it become too strong.",
          "Step 2: Identify when it occurs. It is most common in conventional low-speed aircraft with unbalanced rudders during high sideslip angles (e.g., during a crosswind landing or a skidding turn).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the mechanism. At high sideslip, the local flow angle at the vertical tail increases. On an unbalanced rudder, the center of pressure moves forward of the hinge line. This creates a large, nose-away hinge moment that rapidly deflects (floats) the rudder to its stop. The pilot cannot overcome this force.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the options. Option C directly describes this rapid floating tendency. Options A, B, and D describe factors affecting directional stability or local flow but are not the primary, immediate cause of the locking mechanism. A large $C_{n_\\beta}$ (A) indicates strong directional stability, which is generally desirable and not the cause of lock. Sidewash (B, D) affects the effective angle at the tail but does not directly cause the rudder to lock."
