Using Kepler's Third Law, we can calculate the orbital period of Mars around the Sun. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Applying this, we can derive the orbital period of Mars to be between 686.5 and 687.5 Earth days, which matches the correct answer."
