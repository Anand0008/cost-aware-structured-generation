We need to find the period of Mars ($\\\\tau_M$).",
          "Step 2: Recall Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital periods and semi-major axes of two bodies orbiting the same central mass (in this case, the Sun). The law states: $(\\\\frac{\\\\tau_2}{\\\\tau_1})^2 = (\\\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^3$.",
