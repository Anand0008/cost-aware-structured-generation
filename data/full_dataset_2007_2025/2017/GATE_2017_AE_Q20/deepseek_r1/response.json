This is a fundamental definition in bending theory, independent of cross-section symmetry. For unsymmetrical sections, the NA may be inclined, but the defining property remains: normal stress is zero along it. Option A is incorrect: the 'product of second moment of area' likely refers to the product of inertia ($I_{yz}$), which is zero only about principal axes, not necessarily about the NA. Option C is incorrect: shear stress along the NA is not always zero; it can be maximum (e.g., in rectangular beams). Option D is poorly worded and mixes concepts; it is not a standard true statement."

          "Step 3: Evaluate option A: 'The product of second moment of area about the neutral axis is always zero.' This likely refers to the product of inertia ($I_{yz}$). $I_{yz}$ is zero about principal axes, but the NA is not necessarily a principal axis for unsymmetrical sections under general loading. So, this is false.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate option B: 'The normal stress along the neutral axis is always zero.' This is true by definition, as established in Step 1.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate option C: 'The shear stress along the neutral axis is always zero.' Shear stress distribution depends on loading and cross-section shape. For many shapes (e.g., rectangular), shear stress is maximum at the NA. So, this is false.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate option D: 'The product of second moment of area about the neutral axis and the normal stress about the neutral axis are always zero.' This statement is ambiguous. Even if interpreted as the product of $I$ and $\\sigma$ being zero, while $\\sigma=0$ on NA makes the product zero, the phrase 'are always zero' suggests both are zero individually, which is not true for $I$. This is not a standard or universally true property."
