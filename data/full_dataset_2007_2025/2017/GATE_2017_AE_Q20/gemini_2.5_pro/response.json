        "reasoning": "The neutral axis is fundamentally defined as the axis within a beam's cross-section where the normal bending stress is zero. This is a direct consequence of the strain distribution being linear across the cross-section and the material being linearly elastic, leading to zero strain (and thus zero stress) at the neutral axis. This principle holds true regardless of whether the cross-section is symmetrical or unsymmetrical, as long as the beam is subjected to pure bending and the material is homogeneous and elastic. The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 4, 6) explicitly states this: 'the neutral axis for bending passes through the centroid of the beam's cross-section' and 'bending stress is maximum at the extreme fibers... and zero at the neutral axis.' Chunk 2 and 5, discussing unsymmetrical bending, also show that the normal stress formula `$\\sigma_{xx} = -E/R \\times (y \\sin(\\beta) - z \\cos(\\beta))$` implies zero stress when the distance from the neutral axis (`$y'$`) is zero. Option A is incorrect because for an unsymmetrical cross-section, the product of inertia (`$I_{yz}$`) is generally non-zero unless the coordinate axes happen to be principal axes. Option C is incorrect because shear stress is typically maximum at the neutral axis for many common cross-sections, not zero. Option D combines incorrect and correct statements, making it generally false and poorly phrased."

          "Step 1: Understand the definition of the neutral axis in beam bending. The neutral axis is the longitudinal axis within a beam that experiences no normal stress (neither tension nor compression) when the beam is subjected to bending.",
          "Step 2: Recall the relationship between normal stress, distance from the neutral axis, and bending moment (flexure formula). The normal bending stress `$\\sigma$` at any point `y` from the neutral axis is given by `$\\sigma = \\frac{M \\times y}{I}$` (for symmetrical bending) or a more general form for unsymmetrical bending (as in RAG Chunk 2 and 5).",
          "Step 3: Apply the definition to the neutral axis. By definition, at the neutral axis, the distance `y` (or `y'` in unsymmetrical bending) is zero. Therefore, substituting `y=0` into the flexure formula yields `$\\sigma = 0$`. This confirms that the normal stress along the neutral axis is always zero.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate other options. Option A refers to the product of the second moment of area (product of inertia, `$\\int yz \\, dA$`). For unsymmetrical sections, this term is generally non-zero unless the chosen axes are principal axes (RAG Chunk 2, 3, 5). Option C states shear stress is zero along the neutral axis, which is incorrect; shear stress is often maximum at the neutral axis. Option D combines a generally false statement (product of inertia is zero) with a true one (normal stress is zero), making the combined statement incorrect."
