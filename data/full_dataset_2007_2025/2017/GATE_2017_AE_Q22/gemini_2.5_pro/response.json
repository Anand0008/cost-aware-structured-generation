        "reasoning": "For a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system to vibrate in a single mode (e.g., the first mode) alone, its initial displacement vector must be proportional to that specific mode shape, and its initial velocity vector must be proportional to the same mode shape (or zero if starting from rest). In this problem, we are given an initial displacement for the first mass and asked for the displacement of the second mass to achieve pure first mode vibration. This implies that the initial velocity is zero, and the initial displacement vector `$\\mathbf{u}(0)$` must be a scalar multiple of the first mode shape `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`. Given `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = [0.732 \\ 1]^T$` and `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = [u_1(0) \\ u_2(0)]^T$`, with `$\\ u_1(0) = 1 \\text{ cm}$`. We set `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = C \\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`, where `C` is a constant. This gives `$[1 \\ u_2(0)]^T = C [0.732 \\ 1]^T$`. From the first component, `$\\ 1 = C \\times 0.732$`, so `$\\ C = 1 / 0.732 \\approx 1.36612$`. From the second component, `$\\ u_2(0) = C \\times 1 = 1.36612 \\text{ cm}$`. Rounding to three decimal places, `$\\ u_2(0) = 1.366 \\text{ cm}$`. This value falls within the specified range of 1.360 to 1.370."

        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the condition for pure mode vibration. For an undamped MDOF system to vibrate solely in a particular mode (e.g., the first mode), its initial displacement vector `$\\mathbf{u}(0)$` must be proportional to that mode's shape `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_i$`, and its initial velocity vector `$\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0)$` must also be proportional to `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_i$` (or zero, which is typically assumed when only initial displacement is specified for pure mode vibration).",
          "Step 2: Identify the given mode shape for the first mode. The first mode shape is `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = [0.732 \\ 1]^T$`. This means that for the first mode, the displacement of the first mass is 0.732 units when the second mass displaces 1 unit (or vice-versa, depending on normalization).",
          "Step 3: Formulate the initial displacement vector. The initial displacement of the first mass is given as `$\\ u_1(0) = 1 \\text{ cm}$`. Let the unknown initial displacement of the second mass be `$\\ u_2(0)$`. So, the initial displacement vector is `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = [1 \\ u_2(0)]^T$`. ",
          "Step 4: Apply the proportionality condition. For vibration in the first mode alone, `$\\mathbf{u}(0)$` must be proportional to `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`. Therefore, `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = C \\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.",
          "Step 5: Set up the equations based on the proportionality. `$[1 \\ u_2(0)]^T = C [0.732 \\ 1]^T$`. This expands to two scalar equations: `$\\ 1 = C \\times 0.732$` (from the first component) and `$\\ u_2(0) = C \\times 1$` (from the second component).",
          "Step 6: Solve for the constant `C`. From the first equation, `$\\ C = 1 / 0.732$`. Calculate this value: `$\\ C \\approx 1.3661202$`. ",
          "Step 7: Calculate the required displacement of the second mass. Substitute the value of `C` into the second equation: `$\\ u_2(0) = 1.3661202 \\times 1 \\approx 1.3661202 \\text{ cm}$`.",
          "Step 8: Round the result to three decimal places as required. `$\\ u_2(0) \\approx 1.366 \\text{ cm}$`."

    "question_text": "A 2-DOF undamped spring-mass system with two masses and two springs has natural frequencies omega1 = 0.79 rad/s and omega2 = 1.538 rad/s. The mode shapes for the system are given by phi1 = [0.732 1]^T and phi2 = [-2.73 1]^T. If the first mass is displaced by 1 cm, the minimum displacement in cms to be given to the second mass to make the system vibrate in first mode alone is = _________ (in three decimal place)."
