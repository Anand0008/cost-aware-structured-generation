          "Step 1: Define the Center of Pressure (CP). The CP is the point on an airfoil where the total aerodynamic force can be considered to act, resulting in a zero net pitching moment about that point. Therefore, by definition, $M_{CP} = 0$ for any airfoil at any angle of attack. This makes option A true.",
          "Step 2: Define the Aerodynamic Center (AC). The AC is a fixed point (typically at the quarter-chord, $c/4$, for incompressible flow) about which the pitching moment coefficient is constant and independent of angle of attack, i.e., $dC_{m,ac}/d\\alpha = 0$. The moment itself, $M_{ac}$, or its coefficient $C_{m,ac}$, is not necessarily zero.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the condition for a symmetric airfoil. For a symmetric airfoil, the AC and CP both lie at the quarter-chord point. Furthermore, the pitching moment about the AC, $C_{m,ac}$, is zero. Therefore, at zero lift ($\\alpha=0$), they coincide. For non-zero angles of attack, the CP of a symmetric airfoil remains fixed at the AC, so they coincide at all angles. This makes option C true.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate the constancy of the moment about the AC. The defining property of the AC is that the pitching moment coefficient about it does not vary with angle of attack ($dC_{m,ac}/d\\alpha = 0$). This holds for any airfoil in inviscid, incompressible thin airfoil theory. Thus, option D is true.",
          "Step 5: Identify the false statement. Option B claims the pitching moment is always zero at the AC. This is only true for symmetric airfoils. For cambered airfoils, $C_{m,ac}$ is a constant non-zero value (e.g., -0.1). Therefore, option B is NOT true."
