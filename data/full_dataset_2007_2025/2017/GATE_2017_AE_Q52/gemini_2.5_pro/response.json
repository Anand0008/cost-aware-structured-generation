The minimum principal stress `$\\sigma_{II} = -7 \\, \\text{MN/m}^2$` is also given. The unknown is `$\\sigma_x$`.",
          "Step 2: Recall the formula for principal stresses in a 2D plane stress state. The formula is `$$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$$`.",
          "Step 3: Since the minimum principal stress `$\\sigma_{II}$` is given, use the negative sign in the principal stress formula: `$$\\sigma_{II} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$$`.",
          "Step 4: Substitute the known values into the equation: `$-7 = \\frac{\\sigma_x + 21}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - 21}{2}\\right)^2 + (56)^2}$`.",
          "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate the square root. This will result in a quadratic equation for `$\\sigma_x$`.",
          "Step 6: Expand and simplify the equation. Notice that the `$\\sigma_x^2$` terms will cancel out, leaving a linear equation in `$\\sigma_x$`.",
          "Step 7: Solve the linear equation for `$\\sigma_x$`. The calculation yields `$\\sigma_x = 105 \\, \\text{MN/m}^2$`.",
