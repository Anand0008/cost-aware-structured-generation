The initial conditions are \\(u(x,0)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)\\), \\(u_t(x,0)=0\\). For a string with fixed ends, eigenfunctions are \\(\\sin(n\\pi x)\\) and eigenfrequencies satisfy \\(\\omega_n^2 = c^2 (n\\pi)^2\\) with wave speed \\(c=5\\) (since \\(25=c^2\\)). The given initial shape uses wavenumber \\(10\\pi\\), which corresponds to mode \\(n=10\\). For this mode, \\(\\omega = c n\\pi = 5\\cdot 10\\pi = 50\\pi\\). The solution for a single mode with zero initial velocity is \\(u(x,t)=A\\sin(10\\pi x)\\cos(\\omega t)\\) with \\(A=0.01\\). Thus \\(u(x,t)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)\\cos(50\\pi t)\\).
