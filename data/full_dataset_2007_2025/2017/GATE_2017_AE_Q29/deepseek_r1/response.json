Using separation of variables, the solution is a sum of normal modes: $u(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x)[A_n \\cos(n\\pi c t)+B_n \\sin(n\\pi c t)]$. The initial condition matches a single mode with $n=10$, $A_{10}=0.01$, and $B_n=0$. Thus, $u(x,t)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)\\cos(50\\pi t)$.

The displacement satisfies the following equation of motion: d^2u/dt^2 - 25 d^2u/dx^2 = 0, 0 < x < 1 with u(x, 0) = 0.01 sin(10 pi x), du/dt(x, 0) = 0; u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = 0. The value of u(0.25, 1) is ________ (in three decimal places)."
