The governing equation is $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - 25 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$. Comparing this to the standard wave equation $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$, we find the wave speed squared $c^2 = 25$, so $c = 5$ m/s.\n\nThe boundary conditions are $u(0, t) = 0$ and $u(1, t) = 0$, indicating fixed ends for a rod of length $L = 1$ m.\n\nThe general solution for the 1D wave equation with fixed ends is given by the method of separation of variables:\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) [A_n \\cos(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L}) + B_n \\sin(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L})]$\n\nSubstitute $L=1$ and $c=5$:\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [A_n \\cos(5n\\pi t) + B_n \\sin(5n\\pi t)]$\n\nNow, apply the initial conditions:\n1. Initial velocity: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$\n   Differentiating $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$:\n   $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [-5n\\pi A_n \\sin(5n\\pi t) + 5n\\pi B_n \\cos(5n\\pi t)]$\n   At $t=0$:\n   $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [5n\\pi B_n] = 0$\n   This implies $5n\\pi B_n = 0$ for all $n$, so $B_n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\n   The solution simplifies to: $u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\cos(5n\\pi t)$\n\n2. Initial displacement: $u(x, 0) = 0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi x)$\n   At $t=0$:\n   $u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\cos(0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n   Comparing this with the given initial displacement:\n   $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) = 0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi x)$\n   By inspection (Fourier series comparison), we find that only the term for $n=10$ is non-zero, and $A_{10} = 0.01$.
