        "reasoning": "The Von Mises yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the equivalent stress ($\\sigma_v$) equals the uniaxial yield strength ($Y$). For a general 3D stress state, the equivalent stress is given by the formula: $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_z - \\sigma_x)^2 ] + 3 (\\tau_{xy}^2 + \\tau_{yz}^2 + \\tau_{zx}^2) }$. Given $Y = 330 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_x = 140 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_y = -70 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = x \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{zx} = 0$. Substituting these values into the criterion: $330^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [ (140 - (-70))^2 + (-70 - 0)^2 + (0 - 140)^2 ] + 3 (x^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)$. This simplifies to $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ (210)^2 + (-70)^2 + (-140)^2 ] + 3x^2$. Further calculation yields $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 44100 + 4900 + 19600 ] + 3x^2$, which becomes $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 68600 ] + 3x^2$. So, $108900 = 34300 + 3x^2$. Solving for $x^2$: $3x^2 = 108900 - 34300 = 74600$. Thus, $x^2 = \\frac{74600}{3} \\approx 24866.6666$. Finally, $x = \\sqrt{24866.6666} \\approx 157.692 \\text{ MN/m}^2$.
