    "question_text": "A batch of aluminium alloy yields in uniaxial tension at the stress of 330 MN/m^2. If this material is subjected to the following state of stress: sigma_x = 140 MN/m^2, sigma_y = -70 MN/m^2, sigma_z = 0, tau_xy = x MN/m^2, tau_yz = 0 and tau_zx = 0. The value of x that would result in yielding according to the Von Mises failure criterion is ________ (in three decimal places)."
