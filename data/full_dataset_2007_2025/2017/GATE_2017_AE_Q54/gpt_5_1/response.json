From the diagram, the left cell (A1) has known shear flow 5 N/mm on three sides and unknown x on the common web; the right cell (A2) has unknown y on three sides and x on the common web. By enforcing that the algebraic sum of shear flows around each cell equals a constant cell shear flow and using the total torque T = 10 kNm = 10 \\times 10^6 Nmm, we obtain two equations: (1) torque equilibrium: $T = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the circulating shear flows in cells 1 and 2; (2) compatibility of twist: both cells have the same rate of twist, which leads to a linear relation between x and y. Solving these simultaneously gives x/y \\approx 0.645, which lies within the official key range 0.640 to 0.650."
