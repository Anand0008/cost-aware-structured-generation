        "reasoning": "The relationship between the non-dimensional stick-fixed maneuvering point ($\\bar{N}_m$) and the non-dimensional stick-fixed neutral point ($\\bar{N}_0$) for a conventional aircraft is given by the formula:\n$$\\bar{N}_m = \\bar{N}_0 - \\frac{1.1 \\cdot g \\cdot \\rho \\cdot L_T}{\\tau \\cdot C_{M_{\\delta_e}}}$$ \nWhere:\n*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (positive).\n*   $\\rho$ is the air density (positive).\n*   $L_T$ is the tail arm (distance from wing aerodynamic center to tail aerodynamic center, positive).\n*   $\\tau$ is a positive coefficient encapsulating other aerodynamic and mass parameters.\n*   $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is the pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to elevator deflection ($\\frac{dC_M}{d\\delta_e}$). \n\nFor a conventional aircraft with a horizontal tail, an upward elevator deflection (which is typically considered positive $\\delta_e$) generates a downward aerodynamic force on the tail. This downward force on the tail creates a nose-down pitching moment about the aircraft's center of gravity. Therefore, $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is a negative value.\n\nNow, let's analyze the term $\\bar{N}_m - \\bar{N}_0$:\n$$\\bar{N}_m - \\bar{N}_0 = - \\frac{1.1 \\cdot g \\cdot \\rho \\cdot L_T}{\\tau \\cdot C_{M_{\\delta_e}}}$$ \nSince $g, \\rho, L_T, \\tau$ are all positive, and $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is negative, the denominator ($\\tau \\cdot C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$) will be negative. The numerator ($1.1 \\cdot g \\cdot \\rho \\cdot L_T$) is positive. \n\nSo, we have: \n$$\\bar{N}_m - \\bar{N}_0 = - \\frac{\\text{Positive value}}{\\text{Negative value}} = - (\\text{Negative value}) = \\text{Positive value}$$ \nThus, the numerical value of $\\bar{N}_m - \\bar{N}_0$ will always be positive for a low-speed conventional aircraft. This means the stick-fixed maneuvering point is always located aft of the stick-fixed neutral point, which is consistent with the general understanding that maneuvering stability margin is typically greater than static stability margin."
