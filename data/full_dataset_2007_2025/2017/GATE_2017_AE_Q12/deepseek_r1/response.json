For a conventional aircraft, $C_{M_{\\delta_e}}$ is negative (elevator up causes nose-down moment), making the term $\\frac{1.1 g \\rho L_T}{\\tau C_{M_{\\delta_e}}}$ negative. Thus, subtracting a negative term adds a positive value, so $\\bar{N}_m = \\bar{N}_0 + \\text{positive value}$, meaning $\\bar{N}_m > \\bar{N}_0$. Therefore, $\\bar{N}_m - \\bar{N}_0$ is always positive. The RAG context explicitly states that $\\bar{N}_m$ is generally greater than $\\bar{N}_0$."
