According to the concept definitions and derivations provided in the RAG context, the maneuvering point (NM_bar) is always located aft of the neutral point (N0_bar) for a conventional aircraft. This is because the term `-(1.1 * g * rho * L_T) / (tau * C_M_delta_e)` in the formula for NM_bar is positive, making NM_bar greater than N0_bar. Therefore, the numerical value of N_m_bar - N_0_bar will always be positive."
