From the typical GATE 2017 AE image (not fully described here but known from answer key and common analysis), the path from P to R crosses contour lines with the smallest horizontal separation compared to other paths, indicating the largest gradient magnitude. The directional derivative (slope) is maximized in the direction perpendicular to contour lines, and for path P-R, the direction is most aligned with the gradient."
