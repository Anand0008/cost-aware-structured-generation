        "reasoning": "The question asks for the steepest path leaving from point P. Based on the information provided in the image description, point Q is at a lower elevation (approximately 450 m) compared to point P. Therefore, the steepest path leaving from P would be towards point R, which is at a higher elevation (550 m) compared to the other options. This is consistent with the fact that the gradient vector, which points in the direction of maximum change, is always perpendicular to the contour lines. Therefore, the steepest path must be in the direction perpendicular to the contour lines, which is towards point R."
