        "reasoning": "The steepest path on a contour map is always perpendicular to the contour lines and occurs where the contour lines are most densely packed (closest together). This is a fundamental principle derived from the concept of the gradient of a scalar field. The gradient vector points in the direction of the maximum rate of change and is perpendicular to the level surfaces (contour lines). Visually inspecting the provided contour plot, the contour lines around point P are most tightly packed along the vertical direction, specifically towards point R. This indicates the largest change in altitude over the shortest horizontal distance, hence the steepest slope. The path P to R descends from an approximate elevation of 560m (between 550m and 575m) to 425m, crossing numerous contour lines in a relatively short horizontal distance, making it the steepest option among the choices."

          "Step 2: Recall the concept of 'Steepest Path'. The steepest path corresponds to the direction of the maximum rate of change of the scalar function (altitude). In vector calculus, this direction is given by the gradient of the scalar function, $\\nabla h$.",
          "Step 3: Relate Gradient to Contour Lines. The gradient vector, $\\nabla h$, is always perpendicular (normal) to the contour lines (level surfaces) at any point. Its magnitude is inversely proportional to the spacing between contour lines. Therefore, the steepest path is perpendicular to the contour lines and occurs where the contour lines are closest together.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the Contour Plot. Locate point P on the given contour map. Point P is situated between the 550 m and 575 m contour lines, indicating an approximate elevation of 560-565 m.",
          "Step 5: Identify the Region of Densest Contour Lines. Visually examine the spacing of the contour lines around P in the directions of Q, R, S, and T. The contour lines are most closely spaced along the vertical axis passing through P, both upwards (towards R) and downwards (towards T).",
          "Step 6: Determine the Steepest Path. Comparing the density of contour lines, the path from P towards R exhibits the tightest packing of contour lines. This indicates the largest change in elevation over the shortest horizontal distance, making P to R the steepest path. The path goes from P (approx. 560m) to R (425m), indicating a significant drop in elevation."
