      "explanation": {
        "question_nature": "Calculation",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Extract data from the image. Assume the pipe inner diameter at the flange (section 1) is D1 = 80 mm = 0.08 m, and the nozzle exit diameter (section 2) is D2 = 40 mm = 0.04 m. Given: exit velocity V2 = 8 m/s, atmospheric pressure P_atm = P2 = 101 kPa = 101000 Pa, water density ρ = 1000 kg/m³, friction neglected.",
          "Step 2: Compute cross-sectional areas. A1 = π/4 * D1² = π/4 * (0.08)² ≈ 0.00502655 m². A2 = π/4 * D2² = π/4 * (0.04)² ≈ 0.00125664 m².",
          "Step 3: Apply conservation of mass (continuity) for incompressible flow: Q = A1*V1 = A2*V2. Thus, V1 = (A2/A1)*V2 = (D2²/D1²)*V2 = (0.04²/0.08²)*8 = (1/4)*8 = 2 m/s. The volume flow rate Q = A2*V2 ≈ 0.00125664 * 8 ≈ 0.010053 m³/s.",
          "Step 4: Apply Bernoulli's equation between sections 1 and 2 (incompressible, steady, frictionless, no elevation change): P1/ρ + V1²/2 = P2/ρ + V2²/2. Solve for P1: P1 = P2 + (ρ/2)(V2² - V1²) = 101000 + (1000/2)*(8² - 2²) = 101000 + 500*(64 - 4) = 101000 + 30000 = 131000 Pa. The gauge pressure at section 1 is P1_g = P1 - P_atm = 30000 Pa.",
          "Step 5: Apply the linear momentum equation in the axial direction to a control volume that includes the fluid inside the nozzle. The forces on the fluid are: pressure force at inlet: P1*A1 (in flow direction), pressure force at outlet: -P2*A2 (opposite flow), and the force from the nozzle wall on the fluid, F_wall. The momentum flux change is ρQ(V2 - V1). Thus: P1*A1 - P2*A2 + F_wall = ρQ(V2 - V1).",
          "Step 6: Consider the nozzle as a free body. The forces on the nozzle include: the reaction from the fluid (-F_wall), the atmospheric pressure on the outer surface (net axial component = P_atm*(A1 - A2) in flow direction), and the force from the flange (F_flange, assumed positive in flow direction). Equilibrium gives: F_flange + (-F_wall) + P_atm*(A1 - A2) = 0. Combine with the momentum equation to eliminate F_wall, yielding: F_flange = ρQ(V2 - V1) - P1_g*A1. This is the force exerted by the pipe on the nozzle. The magnitude of the axial force on the flange (from the nozzle on the pipe) is |F_flange|.",
          "Step 7: Compute numerical values. ρQ(V2 - V1) = 1000 * 0.010053 * (8 - 2) ≈ 60.318 N. P1_g*A1 = 30000 * 0.00502655 ≈ 150.797 N. Thus, F_flange ≈ 60.318 - 150.797 = -90.479 N. The magnitude is approximately 90.5 N."
