        "reasoning": "The nozzle reduces diameter from 8 cm (pipe) to 4 cm (exit). Water exits to atmosphere at 101 kPa with V2 = 8 m/s. Neglecting friction and elevation change, apply continuity to find inlet velocity V1 and Bernoulli to find inlet pressure p1. Then apply steady linear momentum equation on the control volume including the nozzle, with forces from pressure at inlet and outlet and the unknown axial flange force. Taking flow direction as positive, the net force equals rate of change of momentum: F_flange + p1 A1 - p2 A2 = \\dot{m}(V2 - V1). Solving gives a flange force of about 91 N (opposite to flow direction). This matches the official answer range 90-92 N."

          "2. Use continuity for incompressible flow to find inlet velocity V1. Since A1 = 4 A2, V1 = (A2/A1) V2 = V2 / 4 = 8/4 = 2 m/s.",
          "3. Apply Bernoulli between section 1 and exit (same elevation, frictionless): p1 + 0.5 \\rho V1^2 = p2 + 0.5 \\rho V2^2. With p2 = 101 kPa (atmosphere) and \\rho = 1000 kg/m^3, solve for p1.",
          "4. Compute p1: p1 = p2 + 0.5 \\rho (V2^2 - V1^2) = 101000 + 0.5(1000)(64 - 4) = 101000 + 30000 = 131000 Pa.",
          "5. Find mass flow rate: \\dot{m} = \\rho A2 V2. With A2 = \\pi (0.04)^2 / 4, evaluate A2 and then \\dot{m}.",
          "6. Apply steady linear momentum equation in axial direction to the control volume including the nozzle: sum of external forces in x equals \\dot{m}(V2 - V1). External forces are pressure forces at 1 and 2 plus the unknown flange force F (on the nozzle by flange). Take positive in direction of flow (to the right). Then: F + p1 A1 - p2 A2 = \\dot{m}(V2 - V1).",
          "7. Substitute p1, p2, A1, A2, V1, V2, and \\dot{m} to solve for F. The result is about F = -91 N, meaning the flange must provide 91 N opposite to flow direction. The magnitude asked is therefore 91 N."
