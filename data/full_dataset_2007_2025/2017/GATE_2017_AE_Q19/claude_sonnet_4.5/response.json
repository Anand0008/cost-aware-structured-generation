In the vaneless space between the impeller and the diffuser vanes in a centrifugal compressor, the angular momentum of the fluid remains constant in the radial direction. This is due to the 'free-vortex' flow condition, where the product of the radius and the tangential velocity component (r * V_w) is constant. As the fluid flows radially outward, the tangential velocity decreases inversely proportional to the radius to conserve angular momentum."
