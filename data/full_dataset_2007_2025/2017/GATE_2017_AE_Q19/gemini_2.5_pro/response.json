        "reasoning": "The question asks about the variation of angular momentum in the vaneless space of a centrifugal compressor. According to fundamental turbomachinery principles, the flow in the vaneless space is often approximated as a free-vortex flow. In a free-vortex flow, the angular momentum per unit mass, which is given by the product of the radius ($r$) and the tangential component of the absolute velocity ($V_w$ or $c_t$), remains constant. This is a direct consequence of the absence of external torque on the fluid in this region. As the fluid moves radially outwards (increasing $r$), its tangential velocity ($V_w$) decreases to conserve angular momentum. Therefore, the angular momentum itself remains constant."
