        "reasoning": "In the vaneless space (also called vaneless diffuser) of a centrifugal compressor, there are no external torques acting on the fluid in the tangential direction. For an ideal, inviscid, steady flow in an axisymmetric passage, the angular momentum per unit mass ($r c_\\theta$) is conserved along a streamline. This is a direct application of the conservation of angular momentum (Euler's turbomachinery equation with no blades/vanes to do work). The RAG context explicitly states: 'Conservation of Angular Momentum in Vaneless Space (ideal, constant depth): r * V_w = constant'. Thus, angular momentum remains constant with increasing radius."

In the absence of viscous forces and external torques (no vanes to guide or impart torque), the angular momentum (also called swirl or whirl) of the fluid is conserved. This is derived from the moment of momentum equation for a control volume.",
          "Step 3: Apply the principle. For a streamline in this vaneless space, the product of radius (r) and tangential velocity component ($V_w$ or $c_\\theta$) remains constant: $r V_\\theta = \\text{constant}$.",
          "Step 4: Interpret the variation. As the flow moves radially outward (radius increases), the tangential velocity ($V_\\theta$) decreases proportionally to keep the angular momentum constant. The absolute value of angular momentum per unit mass does not increase, decrease in a non-monotonic way, or change; it remains constant.",
