        "reasoning": "The condition for longitudinal static stability is that the pitching moment coefficient must decrease with increasing angle of attack (or lift coefficient), providing a restoring moment. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$ or equivalently $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$. The question specifically asks for 'only the longitudinal static stability (and not the condition for equilibrium).' The equilibrium (trim) condition requires $C_m = 0$ at the operating point and may involve a specific $C_{m0}$ sign to achieve a positive trim angle of attack. However, stability depends only on the slope of the $C_m$ curve, not its intercept ($C_{m0}$). Therefore, the correct condition is simply $\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$. Option A and C incorrectly include conditions on $C_{m0}$, which relate to trim, not stability. Option D describes neutral stability, which is unstable."

          "Step 3: Translate this principle into a mathematical condition on the pitching moment coefficient ($C_m$). A restoring moment means if $\\alpha$ increases, $C_m$ should become more negative (nose-down), and if $\\alpha$ decreases, $C_m$ should become more positive (nose-up). Therefore, the slope $\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha}$ must be negative.",
          "Step 4: Recognize the role of $C_{m0}$ (pitching moment at zero lift). $C_{m0}$ determines the trim angle of attack for a given slope but does not affect the inherent stability (the slope itself). A stable aircraft can have positive, negative, or zero $C_{m0}$ depending on design choices for trim.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the options. Option B states only $\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$, which is the pure stability condition. Options A and C add unnecessary conditions on $C_{m0}$, which pertain to trim. Option D ($\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = 0$) indicates neutral stability, which is not statically stable.",
          "Step 6: Confirm with RAG context: Multiple chunks (1, 4, 5, 6) explicitly state that static longitudinal stability requires $\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$ or $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$, with no mention of $C_{m0}$ being part of the stability condition itself."
