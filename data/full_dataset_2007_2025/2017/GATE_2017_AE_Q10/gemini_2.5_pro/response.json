        "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability is defined by the aircraft's inherent tendency to return to its equilibrium state after a disturbance in pitch. Mathematically, this is expressed as a negative slope of the pitching moment coefficient ($C_m$) with respect to the angle of attack ($\\alpha$). This means that if the angle of attack increases (e.g., due to a gust), a nose-down (restoring) pitching moment is generated, tending to reduce the angle of attack back towards the trim value. Conversely, if the angle of attack decreases, a nose-up moment is generated. The condition for this restoring tendency is `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$`. The question specifically asks for *only* the stability condition, not the equilibrium condition. The `C_{m0}` term (pitching moment at zero lift) is related to achieving trim (equilibrium) at a specific angle of attack, but it does not define the stability itself. `$\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = 0$` implies neutral stability, not static stability. Therefore, option B, `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$`, is the sole and correct condition for longitudinal static stability."

        "question_nature": "Conceptual",
        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the core concept. The question asks for the condition of *longitudinal static stability* for a low-speed aircraft, explicitly excluding the condition for equilibrium.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definition of static stability. An aircraft is statically stable if, when disturbed from an equilibrium state, it tends to return to that state. For longitudinal stability (pitch), this means if the nose pitches up (angle of attack increases), a nose-down moment is generated, and vice-versa.",
          "Step 3: Translate this physical tendency into a mathematical condition. The pitching moment coefficient ($C_m$) must decrease as the angle of attack ($\\alpha$) increases. This is represented by a negative slope of the $C_m$ vs. $\\alpha$ curve.",
          "Step 4: Identify the mathematical derivative. This slope is given by the derivative `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha}$`. Therefore, the condition for static longitudinal stability is `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$`.",
          "Step 5: Consider the relationship between $C_m$ and $C_L$. For most flight regimes, lift coefficient ($C_L$) is directly proportional to angle of attack ($\\alpha$). Thus, `$\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$` is an equivalent condition, often used interchangeably.",
          "Step 6: Distinguish stability from equilibrium. The question explicitly states \"and not the condition for equilibrium.\" Equilibrium means the net pitching moment is zero ($C_m = 0$). The term $C_{m0}$ (pitching moment at zero lift) is part of the equilibrium equation ($C_m = C_{m0} + \\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} C_L = 0$) and helps determine the trim angle of attack, but it does not define the *stability* of that equilibrium.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate the given options based on the derived condition and the distinction between stability and equilibrium:",
          "    *   A. `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$` (stability) and `C_{m0} > 0` (equilibrium for positive $\\alpha_{trim}$ with a stable slope). This includes an equilibrium condition, which the question excludes.",
          "    *   B. `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} < 0$`. This is precisely the condition for static longitudinal stability.",
          "    *   C. `$\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} < 0$` (stability) and `C_{m0} < 0` (equilibrium for negative $\\alpha_{trim}$ with a stable slope, or positive $\\alpha_{trim}$ with an unstable slope). This also includes an equilibrium condition.",
          "    *   D. `$\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = 0.0$`. This represents neutral stability, not static stability.",
