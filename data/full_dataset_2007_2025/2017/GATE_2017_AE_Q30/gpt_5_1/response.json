Substituting $y = x^m$ gives the indicial (auxiliary) equation: $m(m-1) + 5m + 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow m^2 + 4m + 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow (m+2)^2 = 0$. Thus there is a repeated root $m_1 = m_2 = -2$. For repeated roots in Cauchy-Euler equations, the two linearly independent solutions are $y_1 = x^{m_1} = x^{-2}$ and $y_2 = x^{m_1} \\ln x = x^{-2} \\ln x$. Therefore the general solution is $y = C_1 x^{-2} + C_2 x^{-2} \\ln x$, which clearly consists of negative integer powers of $x$ and a logarithmic function of $x$. This matches option C and rules out polynomials, finite fractional-power series, or exponentials in $x$."
