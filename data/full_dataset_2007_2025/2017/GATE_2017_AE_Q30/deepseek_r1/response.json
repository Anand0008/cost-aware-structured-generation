This is conceptually relevant because the given Cauchy-Euler equation has a regular singular point at x=0 and the repeated root case (r=-2) corresponds to the Frobenius case of equal indicial roots. However, RAG did not explicitly cover the Cauchy-Euler equation or its direct solution method. Internal knowledge was used for the specific solution steps and formula. Chunks 1-2 were about power series for ordinary points and complex functions, which are less relevant."
