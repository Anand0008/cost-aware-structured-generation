For such equations, we assume a solution of the form $y = x^r$. \\n\\n1.  **Substitute the assumed solution and its derivatives:**\\n    If $y = x^r$, then $\\frac{dy}{dx} = r x^{r-1}$ and $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = r(r-1) x^{r-2}$.\\n    Substituting these into the ODE:\\n    $x^2 [r(r-1) x^{r-2}] + 5x [r x^{r-1}] + 4 [x^r] = 0$\\n    $r(r-1) x^r + 5r x^r + 4 x^r = 0$\\n\\n2.  **Derive the characteristic (indicial) equation:**\\n    Since $x^r \\neq 0$ (for $x \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $x^r$:\\n    $r(r-1) + 5r + 4 = 0$\\n    $r^2 - r + 5r + 4 = 0$\\n    $r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0$\\n\\n3.  **Solve the characteristic equation:**\\n    This is a perfect square trinomial: $(r+2)^2 = 0$.\\n    The roots are $r_1 = -2$ and $r_2 = -2$. These are repeated real roots.\\n\\n4.  **Determine the form of the general solution:**\\n    For an Euler-Cauchy equation with repeated real roots $r_1 = r_2 = r$, the general solution is given by:\\n    $y(x) = C_1 x^r + C_2 x^r \\ln(x)$\\n    Substituting $r = -2$:\\n    $y(x) = C_1 x^{-2} + C_2 x^{-2} \\ln(x)$\\n    This can be written as $y(x) = \\frac{C_1}{x^2} + \\frac{C_2 \\ln(x)}{x^2}$.\\n\\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\\n    The solution consists of terms like $x^{-2}$ (a negative integer power of $x$) and $x^{-2} \\ln(x)$ (a term involving a negative integer power of $x$ multiplied by a logarithmic function of $x$).

They provided detailed information on the indicial equation, cases of roots (especially repeated roots and the emergence of logarithmic terms), and the general Frobenius method, which directly applies to Euler-Cauchy equations as a special case. While the term 'Euler-Cauchy equation' was not explicitly in the RAG, the underlying mathematical principles for solving ODEs with regular singular points and handling repeated roots were well covered."
