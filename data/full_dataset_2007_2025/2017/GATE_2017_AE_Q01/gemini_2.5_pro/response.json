        "reasoning": "To find a vector `v3` that is perpendicular to two given vectors `v1` and `v2`, the most direct and fundamental method is to compute their cross product, `v1 x v2`. The resulting vector from a cross product is inherently orthogonal (perpendicular) to both of the original vectors. Any non-zero scalar multiple of `v1 x v2` will also be perpendicular to both `v1` and `v2`. Option D provides the unit vector in the direction of `v1 x v2`, which is a specific scalar multiple and thus satisfies the condition of being perpendicular to both `v1` and `v2`.\n\nLet's verify the cross product:\nGiven `v1 = i + 3j = (1, 3, 0)`\nGiven `v2 = 2i - 4j + 3k = (2, -4, 3)`\n\nThe cross product `v1 x v2` is calculated using the determinant of a matrix:\n`v1 x v2 = det([[i, j, k], [1, 3, 0], [2, -4, 3]])`\n`= i * ((3)(3) - (0)(-4))`\n`- j * ((1)(3) - (0)(2))`\n`+ k * ((1)(-4) - (3)(2))`\n\n`= i * (9 - 0)`\n`- j * (3 - 0)`\n`+ k * (-4 - 6)`\n\n`= 9i - 3j - 10k`\n\nThis vector `(9, -3, -10)` is perpendicular to both `v1` and `v2`. Option D, `v3 = (v1 x v2) / |v1 x v2|`, represents the unit vector in this direction. Since the question asks for 'the vector v3 that is perpendicular to both v1 and v2', a unit vector in the perpendicular direction is a valid answer. Options A and C involve dot products and vector projections, which are used for different purposes (e.g., finding components parallel or perpendicular to a single vector). Option B, `v3 = k`, can be checked by taking the dot product with `v2`: `k . v2 = (0, 0, 1) . (2, -4, 3) = 3 \\neq 0`, so `k` is not perpendicular to `v2`."

Chunk 3 also reinforced the definition of orthogonality via the dot product, which is the underlying principle. The other chunks were less directly relevant but conceptually related to vector operations and perpendicularity."
