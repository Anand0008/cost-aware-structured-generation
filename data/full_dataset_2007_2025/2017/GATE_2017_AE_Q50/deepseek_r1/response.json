        "notes": "RAG context provided multiple worked examples and key concepts from V. Ganesan's Gas Turbines textbook on centrifugal compressors (Ch. 8). Chunks 1, 2, and 5 were particularly relevant as they contain the Euler work equation, the concept of slip factor (and its ideal value of 1 for 'no slip'), and the relationship between specific work and tip speed. However, none of the examples matched the exact given numbers or the specific 'no slip, no losses' simplification. The core principles needed were present, allowing for accurate analysis. The RAG context was sufficient to base the solution upon."

Consider the whirl velocity component is equal to the impeller speed (ie., no slip) and no losses in the impeller. If the impeller has to rotate at 1900 rad/s, the diameter of the impeller is to be ________ m (in two decimal place)."
