        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the impeller diameter given the power input, mass flow rate, and rotational speed, with the assumptions of 'no slip' and 'no losses in the impeller'.\n\n1.  **Identify the specific work input ($W_c$)**: The power ($P$) is related to the specific work input ($W_c$) and mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) by the equation $P = \\dot{m} W_c$.\n    Given $P = 1800 \\text{ kW} = 1800 \\times 10^3 \\text{ W}$ and $\\dot{m} = 10 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n    So, $W_c = \\frac{P}{\\dot{m}} = \\frac{1800 \\times 10^3 \\text{ W}}{10 \\text{ kg/s}} = 180,000 \\text{ J/kg}$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Euler Turbomachine Equation**: For a compressor, the specific work input is given by $W_c = u_2 c_{t2} - u_1 c_{t1}$.\n    *   'No losses in the impeller' implies ideal work input, and typically, for a centrifugal compressor, the inlet flow is assumed to be axial (no pre-whirl), meaning $c_{t1} = 0$. (While RAG mentions pre-whirl, the problem statement's 'no losses' and 'whirl velocity component is equal to the impeller speed' implies a simplified ideal case, often with axial inlet unless specified otherwise. If pre-whirl were present, $c_{t1}$ would be non-zero, but the problem doesn't provide enough information to calculate it, reinforcing the $c_{t1}=0$ assumption for a basic problem of this type).\n    *   'Whirl velocity component is equal to the impeller speed (i.e., no slip)' means $c_{t2} = u_2$. This is an ideal condition where the slip factor $\\mu = 1$ (as mentioned in RAG Chunk 3 and 6, $\\mu = c_{t2}/u_2$).\n    Substituting these assumptions into the Euler equation:\n    $W_c = u_2 (u_2) - u_1 (0) = u_2^2$.\n\n3.  **Relate impeller tip speed to diameter**: The impeller tip speed ($u_2$) is related to the angular velocity ($\\omega$) and impeller radius ($r_2$) by $u_2 = \\omega r_2$. Since $r_2 = D_2/2$, we have $u_2 = \\omega \\frac{D_2}{2}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the impeller diameter ($D_2$)**: \n    From step 2, $W_c = u_2^2$. So, $u_2 = \\sqrt{W_c}$.\n    Substituting the value of $W_c$ from step 1:\n    $u_2 = \\sqrt{180,000 \\text{ J/kg}} = 424.264 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n    Now, using the relation from step 3: $u_2 = \\omega \\frac{D_2}{2}$.\n    Given $\\omega = 1900 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n    $424.264 = 1900 \\times \\frac{D_2}{2}$\n    $D_2 = \\frac{2 \\times 424.264}{1900} = \\frac{848.528}{1900} \\approx 0.4466 \\text{ m}$.\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the diameter is $0.45 \\text{ m}$. This value falls within the specified range of $0.40 \\text{ to } 0.50 \\text{ m}$."
