        "reasoning": "Option C states that 'The location of transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer depends **only** on the operating Reynolds number.' This statement is NOT true. While the Reynolds number ($Re$) is a primary parameter influencing boundary layer transition, it is not the sole factor. As per the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2, 6), the transition point also depends heavily on other factors such as surface roughness, freestream turbulence levels, pressure gradients, and Mach number. The word 'only' makes this statement incorrect.\n\nLet's validate the other options:\n*   **Option A:** 'Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent boundary layer is more desirable on a wing operating at large angle of attack.' This is TRUE. Turbulent boundary layers are more resistant to flow separation (Chunk 1, 3, 4, 5) due to increased momentum transfer. At large angles of attack, strong adverse pressure gradients occur, making the boundary layer prone to separation and stall. A turbulent boundary layer can delay this separation, thus maintaining lift and delaying stall.\n*   **Option B:** 'The skin friction drag for a turbulent boundary layer is larger than that for a laminar boundary layer.' This is TRUE. Turbulent boundary layers are characterized by chaotic, unsteady motion and higher momentum transfer, leading to greater shear stress at the wall and consequently higher skin friction drag compared to laminar boundary layers at the same Reynolds number and location (Chunk 1, 2, 4).\n*   **Option D:** 'A separated flow does not necessarily lead to a turbulent boundary layer.' This is TRUE. Flow separation can occur for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. In fact, laminar boundary layers are more prone to separation under adverse pressure gradients (Chunk 5). If a laminar boundary layer separates, it remains a laminar separated flow at the point of separation. Turbulence might develop in the separated shear layer further downstream, but the separation event itself does not automatically imply the boundary layer was or immediately became turbulent."

          "Step 1: Understand the objective of the question, which is to identify the statement that is factually incorrect among the given options regarding boundary layer characteristics.",
          "Step 2: Evaluate Option A. Recall the properties of laminar and turbulent boundary layers concerning flow separation. Turbulent boundary layers are known to be more robust and resistant to separation under adverse pressure gradients (RAG Chunk 1, 3, 4, 5). At large angles of attack, wings experience significant adverse pressure gradients, making early separation (stall) a concern. Therefore, a turbulent boundary layer, which delays separation, is desirable. Statement A is TRUE.",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option B. Compare the skin friction drag for laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Turbulent flow involves more mixing and higher shear stresses at the wall, resulting in higher skin friction drag compared to laminar flow (RAG Chunk 1, 2, 4). Statement B is TRUE.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option C. Consider the factors that influence the transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary layer. While the Reynolds number is a critical parameter, the transition location is also significantly affected by surface roughness, freestream turbulence intensity, pressure gradients, and Mach number (RAG Chunk 2, 6). The statement claims it depends 'only' on the Reynolds number, which is a strong and incorrect generalization. Statement C is NOT TRUE.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option D. Analyze the relationship between flow separation and boundary layer type. Flow separation can occur for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Laminar boundary layers are actually more susceptible to separation (RAG Chunk 5). A separated laminar flow does not automatically become turbulent at the point of separation. Therefore, separation does not necessarily lead to a turbulent boundary layer. Statement D is TRUE.",
          "Step 6: Conclude based on the analysis. Since Option C is the only statement identified as NOT true, it is the correct answer to the question."
