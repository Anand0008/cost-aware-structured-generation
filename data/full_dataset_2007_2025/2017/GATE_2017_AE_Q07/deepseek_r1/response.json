This is a well-established fact in boundary layer theory. Statements A, B, and D are consistent with fundamental aerodynamics: (A) turbulent boundary layers are more resistant to separation at high angles of attack; (B) turbulent skin friction drag is higher; (D) separation can occur in both laminar and turbulent regimes. The provided RAG context strongly supports this analysis, especially Chunks 2 and 6 which explicitly list multiple factors affecting transition."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the question format. We must identify the one statement that is NOT true. Therefore, three statements must be true and one false.",
          "Step 2: Analyze Statement A: 'Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent boundary layer is more desirable on a wing operating at large angle of attack.' At high angles of attack, the adverse pressure gradient on the upper surface is severe. A turbulent boundary layer, due to its higher momentum mixing, is more resistant to flow separation, delaying stall and maintaining lift. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
          "Step 3: Analyze Statement B: 'The skin friction drag for a turbulent boundary layer is larger than that for a laminar boundary layer.' The coefficient of skin friction ($C_f$) for a turbulent boundary layer is significantly higher than for a laminar one at the same Reynolds number, as the chaotic motion increases shear stress at the wall. This is a fundamental comparison. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
          "Step 4: Analyze Statement C: 'The location of transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer depends only on the operating Reynolds number.' This is an oversimplification. While the Reynolds number ($Re = \\frac{\\rho V x}{\\mu}$) is a primary parameter, transition is also critically influenced by surface roughness, freestream turbulence intensity, pressure gradient (favorable or adverse), heat transfer, and acoustic disturbances. Therefore, this statement is NOT TRUE.",
          "Step 5: Analyze Statement D: 'A separated flow does not necessarily lead to a turbulent boundary layer.' Separation is a consequence of an adverse pressure gradient overcoming the fluid's momentum near the wall. It can occur in a laminar boundary layer (leading to laminar separation) or in a turbulent boundary layer (turbulent separation). Separation itself does not mandate turbulence; a laminar separated shear layer may later transition. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that Statement C is the incorrect one, as it contains the false claim 'depends only on'."
