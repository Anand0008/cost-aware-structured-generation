        "reasoning": "This is a classic 'work and time' problem that can be solved using a system of linear equations. Let 'm' be the work rate of one man (fraction of bridge built per week) and 'w' be the work rate of one woman (fraction of bridge built per week).\n\nFrom the first statement:\n1200 men and 500 women build a bridge in 2 weeks. This means the total work rate is $\\frac{1 \\text{ bridge}}{2 \\text{ weeks}}$.\nSo, $(1200m + 500w) \\times 2 = 1 \\implies 2400m + 1000w = 1$ (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the second statement:\n900 men and 250 women build the same bridge in 3 weeks. This means the total work rate is $\\frac{1 \\text{ bridge}}{3 \\text{ weeks}}$.\nSo, $(900m + 250w) \\times 3 = 1 \\implies 2700m + 750w = 1$ (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1) $2400m + 1000w = 1$\n2) $2700m + 750w = 1$\n\nTo solve for 'm' and 'w', we can eliminate one variable. Let's eliminate 'w'.\nMultiply Equation 2 by 4: $4 \\times (2700m + 750w) = 4 \\times 1 \\implies 10800m + 3000w = 4$ (Equation 3)\nMultiply Equation 1 by 3: $3 \\times (2400m + 1000w) = 3 \\times 1 \\implies 7200m + 3000w = 3$ (Equation 4)\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 3:\n$(10800m + 3000w) - (7200m + 3000w) = 4 - 3$\n$3600m = 1$\n\nThis gives us the work rate of one man: $m = \\frac{1}{3600}$ bridge/week/man.\n\nThe question asks: 'How many men will be needed to build the bridge in one week?'\nLet 'X' be the number of men required.\nSo, $(Xm) \\times 1 = 1$\n$X \\times \\frac{1}{3600} = 1$\n$X = 3600$\n\nTherefore, 3600 men will be needed to build the bridge in one week. This matches option C."

We have:\n   1) $2400m + 1000w = 1$\n   2) $2700m + 750w = 1$\n   To eliminate 'w', multiply Equation 2 by 4 (to get $3000w$) and Equation 1 by 3 (to get $3000w$).\n   New Equation 3: $10800m + 3000w = 4$\n   New Equation 4: $7200m + 3000w = 3$",
