        "reasoning": "The question describes a loss 'due to the turning of the wall boundary layer through an angle due to curved surface.' This is the precise mechanism of secondary flow loss as described in standard gas turbine and turbomachinery literature (e.g., V. Ganesan). Secondary flows are three-dimensional vortices that form near the hub and casing end-walls because the low-momentum fluid in the wall boundary layer cannot negotiate the pressure gradient imposed by the curved blade passage. This low-energy fluid is turned and swept across the blade channel, leading to vortices and dissipation. Profile loss (A) is primarily a 2D effect on the blade surface itself. Annulus loss (B) is due to skin friction on the stationary end-walls. Tip clearance loss (C) is due to leakage flow over the blade tip gap in a rotor. The RAG context (Chunks 2 and 6) explicitly describes secondary loss as arising from the interaction of the main turning flow with the low-energy boundary layer on the end walls, confirming the answer."

          "Step 3: Match the description to the correct mechanism: Profile loss relates to the 2D boundary layer on the blade airfoil. Annulus loss is due to wall friction. Tip clearance loss is from leakage over the blade tip. Secondary flow loss is uniquely characterized by the turning and rolling-up of the end-wall boundary layer into vortices due to the blade-to-blade pressure gradient and blade curvature.",
