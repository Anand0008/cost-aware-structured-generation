        "reasoning": "The question describes a loss mechanism involving the 'turning of the wall boundary layer through an angle due to curved surface'. This precisely matches the definition of secondary flow loss. Secondary flows are complex, three-dimensional viscous effects that occur near the end walls (hub and casing) of turbomachinery blades (both compressors and turbines). They arise from the interaction between the main flow, which is being turned by the blades, and the low-energy boundary layer fluid on the end walls. The pressure gradient across the blade channel (from the pressure surface to the suction surface) causes this low-momentum boundary layer fluid to be pushed sideways, or 'turned', forming streamwise vortices (secondary vortices). These vortices are highly dissipative and transport low-energy fluid, leading to significant energy loss. The retrieved knowledge explicitly defines secondary loss as a 'complex, three-dimensional loss mechanism that occurs near the end walls' due to the 'interaction between the main flow, which is being turned by the blades, and the low-energy boundary layer fluid on the hub and casing', leading to cross-flow and 'streamwise vortices'."

          "Step 1: Analyze the key phrase in the question: 'turning of the wall boundary layer through an angle due to curved surface'. This indicates a three-dimensional flow phenomenon involving viscous effects near the solid boundaries (walls) of the flow passage.",
          "Step 2: Recall the definitions of the different types of aerodynamic losses in turbomachinery stages (compressors or turbines).",
          "Step 3: Evaluate Option A, Profile loss: This loss is associated with the two-dimensional shape of the blade and the boundary layer growth/separation on the blade surfaces. It does not primarily describe the turning of a *wall* boundary layer.",
          "Step 4: Evaluate Option B, Annulus loss: This loss is due to viscous friction on the stationary end walls (hub and casing). While it occurs on the walls, it primarily refers to frictional dissipation, not the specific 'turning' of the boundary layer fluid due to cross-channel pressure gradients.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option C, Tip clearance loss: This loss occurs in rotor rows due to the leakage of fluid through the gap between the blade tip and the casing, driven by the pressure difference across the blade. It is not related to the turning of a wall boundary layer.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option D, Secondary flow loss: This loss is a three-dimensional effect near the end walls. It is caused by the interaction of the main flow's pressure gradient with the low-momentum fluid in the wall boundary layers. This interaction causes the wall boundary layer fluid to migrate from the pressure side to the suction side of the blade passage, effectively 'turning' or deflecting it, and forming dissipative secondary vortices. This description perfectly matches the phenomenon stated in the question.",
          "Step 7: Conclude that Secondary flow loss is the correct answer."
