        "reasoning": "For a perfect gas, the stagnation temperature is defined by \\(T_0 = T + V^2/(2c_p)\\). Hence \\(\\Delta T = T_0 - T = V^2/(2c_p)\\). The diagram shows that \\((\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B\\), so \\(V_A^2 = V_B^2\\) and therefore \\(V_A = V_B\\) (taking positive speeds). Thus the flow speed is the same at A and B. Mach number is \\(M = V/a\\), where \\(a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}\\). Since the curve on the T-s diagram moves to higher temperature from A to B (with heat addition), we have \\(T_B > T_A\\), so \\(a_B > a_A\\). With equal velocities, \\(M_B = V/a_B < V/a_A = M_A\\). Therefore \\(M_A > M_B\\). Now we must determine whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic. For steady 1-D flow with heat transfer in a constant-area duct (Rayleigh flow), the Rayleigh line on an h-s or T-s diagram has a maximum stagnation temperature at \\(M = 1\\). On a T-s diagram, as heat is added to a subsonic flow, both static and stagnation temperatures increase and the Mach number moves toward 1 (i.e., increases). For a supersonic flow, heat addition decreases Mach number away from 1. In the given figure, entropy increases from A to B and the Mach number decreases (since \\(M_A > M_B\\)), so the only consistent possibility is that the flow is initially supersonic and is being decelerated by heat addition. Hence the correct statement is: Flow is supersonic and \\(M_A > M_B\\) (option B)."
