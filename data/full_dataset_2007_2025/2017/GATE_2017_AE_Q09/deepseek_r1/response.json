Given $\\Delta T_A = \\Delta T_B$, we have $T_A M_A^2 = T_B M_B^2$. From the T-s diagram with heat transfer (likely heat addition), stagnation temperature $T_0$ increases along the flow. Since $\\Delta T$ is constant, static temperature $T$ must also increase (as $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$). Thus, $T_B > T_A$, and from $T_A M_A^2 = T_B M_B^2$, it follows that $M_A > M_B$. For heat addition in compressible flow (Rayleigh flow), supersonic flow decelerates ($M$ decreases), so $M_A > M_B$ implies supersonic flow. Hence, flow is supersonic and $M_A > M_B$, matching option B."

However, it lacked direct content on flow with heat transfer (Rayleigh flow). Therefore, internal knowledge was used for Rayleigh flow concepts and analysis."

The T-s diagram shows both the static and the stagnation conditions at two locations, A and B, in the duct. At and Bt denote stagnation conditions for states A and B, respectively. It is known that (delta T)_A = (delta T)_B. M_A and M_B are the Mach numbers of the flow at locations A and B. Which of the following statements is true about the flow."
