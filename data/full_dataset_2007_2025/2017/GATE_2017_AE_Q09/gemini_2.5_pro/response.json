        "reasoning": "The problem describes a steady one-dimensional flow of a perfect gas with heat transfer in a duct. We are given a T-s diagram showing static (A, B) and stagnation ($A_t$, $B_t$) conditions, and the condition that $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$, where $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$.\n\n1.  **Relate $\\Delta T$ to Mach number (M) and static temperature (T):**\n    The fundamental isentropic relation between stagnation temperature ($T_0$) and static temperature ($T$) for a perfect gas is:\n    $$\\frac{T_0}{T} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n    Rearranging this to express $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$:\n    $$\\frac{T_0 - T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n    Therefore, $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n\n2.  **Apply the given condition $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$:**\n    Let $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B = \\Delta T_{common}$.\n    For location A: $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_A} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_A^2$\n    For location B: $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_B} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_B^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the relationship between $M_A$ and $M_B$:**\n    Divide the equation for A by the equation for B:\n    $$\\frac{(\\Delta T_{common}/T_A)}{(\\Delta T_{common}/T_B)} = \\frac{(\\gamma - 1)/2 \\cdot M_A^2}{(\\gamma - 1)/2 \\cdot M_B^2}$$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2}$$\n    From the T-s diagram, it is clear that the static temperature at A is lower than at B ($T_A < T_B$). Therefore, $\\frac{T_B}{T_A} > 1$.\n    Substituting this into the derived relation:\n    $$\\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2} > 1 \\implies M_A^2 > M_B^2 \\implies M_A > M_B$$ \n    (Since Mach numbers are positive).\n\n4.  **Determine the flow regime (subsonic or supersonic):**\n    From the T-s diagram, as the flow proceeds from A to B:\n    *   Static temperature ($T$) increases ($T_A < T_B$).\n    *   Entropy ($s$) increases ($s_A < s_B$).\n    *   Stagnation temperature ($T_0$) increases ($T_{0A} < T_{0B}$, as $T_{0A} = T_A + (\\Delta T)_A$ and $T_{0B} = T_B + (\\Delta T)_B$, and $T_A < T_B$ while $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$). An increase in stagnation temperature indicates heat addition to the flow.\n    *   We have already established that the Mach number decreases ($M_A > M_B$).\n\n    Now, consider the effect of heat addition on Mach number and static temperature for a perfect gas in a constant area duct (similar to Rayleigh flow behavior):\n    *   **Subsonic flow (M < 1) with heat addition:** Static temperature ($T$) increases, and Mach number ($M$) increases towards 1.\n    *   **Supersonic flow (M > 1) with heat addition:** Static temperature ($T$) increases, but Mach number ($M$) decreases towards 1.\n\n    Since the flow from A to B shows an increase in static temperature ($T$) and a decrease in Mach number ($M$), the flow must be **supersonic**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the findings, the flow is supersonic and $M_A > M_B$. This corresponds to option B."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the given information from the question statement and the T-s diagram. The diagram shows static (A, B) and stagnation ($A_t$, $B_t$) conditions, and it's given that the difference between stagnation and static temperature, $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$, is the same at both locations A and B, i.e., $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the fundamental compressible flow relation between stagnation temperature ($T_0$), static temperature ($T$), and Mach number ($M$) for a perfect gas: $\\frac{T_0}{T} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$.",
          "Step 3: Express the given temperature difference, $\\Delta T$, in terms of static temperature and Mach number. From the relation in Step 2, we can write $\\frac{T_0 - T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$.",
          "Step 4: Apply the condition $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$. Let this common value be $\\Delta T_{common}$. Then, for location A, $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_A} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_A^2$, and for location B, $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_B} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_B^2$.",
          "Step 5: Divide the two equations from Step 4 to find the relationship between $M_A$ and $M_B$. This yields $\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2}$.",
          "Step 6: Analyze the T-s diagram to determine the relationship between $T_A$ and $T_B$. The diagram clearly shows that the static temperature at A is lower than at B ($T_A < T_B$). Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{T_B}{T_A} > 1$.",
          "Step 7: Substitute the temperature ratio into the equation from Step 5. Since $\\frac{T_B}{T_A} > 1$, it implies $\\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2} > 1$, which means $M_A^2 > M_B^2$. Taking the square root (Mach numbers are positive), we get $M_A > M_B$.",
          "Step 8: Determine the flow regime (subsonic or supersonic). From the T-s diagram, as the flow moves from A to B, static temperature ($T$) increases, and entropy ($s$) increases. Also, since $T_0 = T + \\Delta T$ and $T_A < T_B$ with $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$, it means $T_{0A} < T_{0B}$, indicating heat addition to the flow. We found that Mach number decreases ($M_A > M_B$). For flow with heat addition, an increase in static temperature accompanied by a decrease in Mach number is characteristic of supersonic flow. (In subsonic flow with heat addition, both T and M would increase).",
          "Step 9: Conclude the statement about the flow. Based on the analysis, the flow is supersonic and $M_A > M_B$."

The T-s diagram shows both the static and the stagnation conditions at two locations, A and B, in the duct. At and Bt denote stagnation conditions for states A and B, respectively. It is known that (delta T)_A = (delta T)_B. M_A and M_B are the Mach numbers of the flow at locations A and B. Which of the following statements is true about the flow."
