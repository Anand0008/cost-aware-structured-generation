Chunk 5 reinforced the importance of using different specific heats for air and combustion products, which is a key detail in the problem. The RAG context was highly helpful and sufficient for solving the problem."

The specific heat at constant pressure for the incoming air and the burned products are 1.005 kJ/kgK and 1.147 kJ/kgK respectively. Considering 100% burner efficiency, the stagnation temperature at the exit of the combustor is equal to ________ K. (in one decimal place)."
