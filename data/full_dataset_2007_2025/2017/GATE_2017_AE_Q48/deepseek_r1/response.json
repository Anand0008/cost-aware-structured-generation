    "question_text": "Air, at 450 K stagnation temperature and at a rate of 50 kg/s, enters the combustor of a turbofan engine and is burned with 1 kg/s of Aviation Kerosene (Heating value 44 MJ/kg). The specific heat at constant pressure for the incoming air and the burned products are 1.005 kJ/kgK and 1.147 kJ/kgK respectively. Considering 100% burner efficiency, the stagnation temperature at the exit of the combustor is equal to ________ K. (in one decimal place)."
