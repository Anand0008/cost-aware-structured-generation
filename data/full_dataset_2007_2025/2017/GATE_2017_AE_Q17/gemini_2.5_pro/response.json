        "reasoning": "The maximum gas flow rate that a compressor can handle at a given rotational speed is dictated by 'Choking'. Choking occurs when the flow at some point within the compressor (typically a narrow passage like the diffuser throat or blade passages) reaches sonic velocity (Mach 1). Once this condition is met, no further increase in mass flow rate is possible, even if the downstream pressure is reduced. This phenomenon sets the absolute upper limit for mass flow on the compressor performance map. Compressor Surge and Rotating Stall, on the other hand, are instabilities that occur at *low* mass flow rates, not maximum flow rates. Optimum Design Pressure Ratio is a design parameter, not an operational limit on maximum flow."

          "Step 4: Understand the implication of choking. Once the flow is choked, the mass flow rate through that section cannot be increased further, regardless of changes in downstream pressure. This physically limits the maximum mass flow rate the compressor can process.",

'Compressor Surge' and 'Rotating Stall' are instabilities that occur at *low* mass flow rates, leading to flow reversal and unsteady operation, not limiting the maximum flow. 'Optimum Design Pressure Ratio' is a design target, not a physical operational limit on flow rate.",
