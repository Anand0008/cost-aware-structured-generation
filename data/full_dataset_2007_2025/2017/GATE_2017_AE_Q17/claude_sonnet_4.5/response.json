        "reasoning": "The maximum gas flow rate that can be handled by a multistage axial compressor at a given rotational speed is dictated by choking. Choking occurs when the flow at some point within the compressor (typically the diffuser throat) reaches sonic velocity (Mach 1). Once choking occurs, no further increase in mass flow rate is possible, regardless of a reduction in downstream pressure. This phenomenon sets the right-hand boundary of the compressor performance map. The other options, compressor surge and rotating stall, are instability phenomena that limit the compressor's operating range on the left side of the map, but do not directly determine the maximum flow rate. The optimum design pressure ratio is also not the factor that limits the maximum flow rate."
