        "reasoning": "A process is considered reversible if, after it has occurred, both the system and its surroundings can be restored to their initial states without leaving any net change in the universe. This ideal condition requires the absence of all irreversibilities. Irreversibilities arise from finite gradients (pressure, temperature) or dissipative effects (like friction). The problem statement specifies a 'frictionless piston', eliminating friction as a source of irreversibility within the system for mechanical processes.\n\nLet's analyze each process:\n*   **(i) Expansion with finite pressure difference with the surrounding:** A finite pressure difference implies that the expansion is not quasi-static (infinitesimally slow). This leads to unrestrained expansion, which is a highly irreversible process because the system is not in equilibrium with its surroundings at all times. Therefore, this process is irreversible.\n*   **(ii) Compression with infinitesimal pressure difference with the surrounding:** An infinitesimal pressure difference means the compression occurs quasi-statically. The system is always infinitesimally close to equilibrium with its surroundings. Given the frictionless piston, this process avoids mechanical irreversibilities and is considered internally reversible.\n*   **(iii) Heat transfer with finite temperature difference with the reservoir:** Heat transfer across a finite temperature difference is a classic example of an external irreversibility. For heat transfer to be reversible, the temperature difference between the system and the reservoir must be infinitesimally small. Therefore, this process is irreversible.\n*   **(iv) Heat transfer with infinitesimal temperature difference with the reservoir:** An infinitesimal temperature difference ensures that the heat transfer process is externally reversible. The system and the reservoir are always infinitesimally close to thermal equilibrium, preventing entropy generation due to thermal gradients.\n\nBased on this analysis, only processes (ii) and (iv) are reversible. Thus, option D is the correct answer."

          "**Step 1: Understand the definition of a reversible process.** A reversible process is an idealized thermodynamic process that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the surroundings. This means both the system and its surroundings return to their initial states.",
          "**Step 2: Identify the conditions for reversibility.** For a process to be reversible, all irreversibilities must be absent. Common sources of irreversibility include friction, unrestrained expansion/compression (due to finite pressure differences), and heat transfer across a finite temperature difference.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the given condition 'frictionless piston'.** This condition eliminates friction as a source of internal irreversibility for the mechanical work processes (expansion/compression).",
          "**Step 4: Evaluate process (i) - Expansion with finite pressure difference.** A 'finite pressure difference' means the expansion is not quasi-static. The system is not in equilibrium with its surroundings throughout the process, leading to unrestrained expansion, which is inherently irreversible.",
          "**Step 5: Evaluate process (ii) - Compression with infinitesimal pressure difference.** An 'infinitesimal pressure difference' implies that the compression occurs quasi-statically. The system is always in equilibrium (or infinitesimally close to it) with its surroundings. Combined with the frictionless piston, this process is reversible.",
          "**Step 6: Evaluate process (iii) - Heat transfer with finite temperature difference.** A 'finite temperature difference' during heat transfer is a direct source of external irreversibility. Heat flow from a higher temperature to a lower temperature across a finite difference is an irreversible phenomenon.",
          "**Step 7: Evaluate process (iv) - Heat transfer with infinitesimal temperature difference.** An 'infinitesimal temperature difference' ensures that heat transfer occurs quasi-statically, meaning the system and reservoir are always in thermal equilibrium. This makes the heat transfer process externally reversible.",
          "**Step 8: Conclude the reversible processes.** Based on the analysis, only processes (ii) and (iv) satisfy the conditions for reversibility."
