This is an internally irreversible mechanical process, hence not reversible.\\n(ii) Compression with infinitesimal pressure difference with surroundings: An infinitesimal pressure difference ensures the piston moves quasi-statically, so the system remains arbitrarily close to equilibrium. With a frictionless piston (given), this mechanical process is internally reversible.\\n(iii) Heat transfer with finite temperature difference with the reservoir: Finite temperature difference causes entropy generation in the surroundings; this is an externally irreversible heat transfer process, so not reversible.\\n(iv) Heat transfer with infinitesimal temperature difference with the reservoir: Infinitesimal temperature difference makes the heat transfer quasi-static and externally reversible (no entropy generation in surroundings).

This system can undergo following processes (i) Expansion with finite pressure difference with the surrounding. (ii) Compression with infinitesimal pressure difference with the surrounding. (iii) Heat transfer with finite temperature difference with the reservoir. (iv) Heat transfer with infinitesimal temperature difference with the reservoir. Out of these which processes are reversible?"
