Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, a SCRAMJET engine is expected to have the highest Isp among the options given.\n\nSpecifically, the key points are:\n1. Solid propellant rockets typically have Isp values in the range of 170-220 seconds (Chunk 6).\n2. Liquid propellant rockets using cryogenic propellants like LH2/LOX can achieve Isp around 362 seconds (Chunk 5).\n3. SCRAMJET engines, which are a type of air-breathing hypersonic engine, can potentially achieve much higher Isp values, up to 10,000 seconds or even higher (Chunk 2).\n\nTherefore, the SCRAMJET engine is the correct answer as it is expected to have the maximum specific impulse compared to the other options provided."
