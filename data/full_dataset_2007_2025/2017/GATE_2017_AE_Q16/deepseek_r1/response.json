        "reasoning": "Specific Impulse (I_sp) is a measure of propulsion efficiency, defined as thrust produced per unit weight flow rate of propellant ($I_{sp} = F / (\\dot{m}_p g_0)$). Among the options, cryogenic rockets (e.g., LH2/LOX) have high I_sp (~450-470 s). Solid propellant rockets have lower I_sp (~170-300 s). Generic 'Liquid Propellant Rocket' includes storable liquids (lower I_sp) and cryogenics. A SCRAMjet (Supersonic Combustion Ramjet) is an air-breathing engine that uses atmospheric oxygen as oxidizer, carrying only fuel. Its effective I_sp, based on fuel flow only, is significantly higher (typically 1000-4000 s) than any chemical rocket because it does not carry oxidizer, leading to much greater propellant mass efficiency. Therefore, SCRAMjet has the maximum specific impulse."

          "Step 3: Review typical I_sp ranges for each engine type from propulsion knowledge: Solid rockets (~170-300 s), Liquid rockets (non-cryogenic: ~250-350 s; cryogenic LH2/LOX: ~450-470 s), SCRAMjets (air-breathing, fuel-specific I_sp ~1000-4000 s).",
          "Step 4: Recognize that SCRAMjets are air-breathing engines. They use atmospheric oxygen, so they only need to carry fuel onboard. This drastically reduces the mass of propellant they need to carry compared to rockets, which must carry both fuel and oxidizer. Hence, their effective I_sp (based on fuel flow) is much higher.",
          "Step 5: Compare the ranges: SCRAMjet I_sp values are an order of magnitude higher than the best chemical rockets (cryogenic). Therefore, SCRAMjet is expected to have the maximum Specific Impulse."
