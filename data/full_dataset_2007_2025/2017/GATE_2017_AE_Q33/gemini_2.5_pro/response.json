          "description": "Instead of describing the flow field at fixed points in space (Eulerian), the Lagrangian approach tracks the position of individual fluid particles over time. If the particle's position $\\mathbf{r}_p(t)$ is known, its velocity is $\\mathbf{V}_p(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}_p}{dt}$ and its acceleration is $\\mathbf{a}_p(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{V}_p}{dt}$. This requires solving differential equations for particle paths.",
