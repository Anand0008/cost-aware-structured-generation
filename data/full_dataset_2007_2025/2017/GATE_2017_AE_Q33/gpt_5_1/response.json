        "reasoning": "The material (substantial) acceleration is given by \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\dfrac{D\\mathbf{V}}{Dt} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{V}\\). The velocity field is \\(\\mathbf{V} = 4tx\\,\\mathbf{i} - 2t^2 y\\,\\mathbf{j} + 4xz\\,\\mathbf{k}\\). First compute the partial time derivative: \\(\\partial \\mathbf{V}/\\partial t = 4x\\,\\mathbf{i} - 4ty\\,\\mathbf{j} + 0\\,\\mathbf{k}\\). Next compute the spatial derivatives of each component and form the convective term \\((\\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{V}\\). At the point \\((x,y,z,t)=(-1,1,0,1)\\), the velocity is \\(\\mathbf{V}=(-4,-2,0)\\). The needed gradients are: \\(\\partial u/\\partial x = 4t = 4\\), \\(\\partial u/\\partial y = 0\\), \\(\\partial u/\\partial z = 0\\); \\(\\partial v/\\partial x = 0\\), \\(\\partial v/\\partial y = -2t^2 = -2\\), \\(\\partial v/\\partial z = 0\\); \\(\\partial w/\\partial x = 4z = 0\\), \\(\\partial w/\\partial y = 0\\), \\(\\partial w/\\partial z = 4x = -4\\). Thus the convective acceleration components are: \\(a_x^{(c)} = u\\,\\partial u/\\partial x + v\\,\\partial u/\\partial y + w\\,\\partial u/\\partial z = (-4)(4) = -16\\); \\(a_y^{(c)} = u\\,\\partial v/\\partial x + v\\,\\partial v/\\partial y + w\\,\\partial v/\\partial z = (-2)(-2) = 4\\); \\(a_z^{(c)} = u\\,\\partial w/\\partial x + v\\,\\partial w/\\partial y + w\\,\\partial w/\\partial z = 0\\). The local acceleration at the point is \\(\\partial \\mathbf{V}/\\partial t = (4x, -4ty, 0) = (-4, -4, 0)\\). Therefore the total acceleration is \\(\\mathbf{a} = (-4-16, -4+4, 0) = (-20, 0, 0)\\). Its magnitude is \\(|\\mathbf{a}| = \\sqrt{(-20)^2} = 20\\). This matches the official answer range 20 to 20."
