        "reasoning": "The problem requires constructing a family tree based on the given relationships and then evaluating which statement *must necessarily be FALSE*.\n\n**Step 1: Establish core relationships.**\n*   X and Y are married, and have two children: P and Q.\n*   Z and W are married, and have one child: R.\n*   Each of P, Q, R, S, W, X, Y and Z has been married at most once.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the relationship between P and R.**\n*   \"Z is the grandfather of the daughter S of P.\"\n    *   This means P has a daughter, S.\n    *   For Z to be S's grandfather, Z must be a parent of P's spouse. (If Z were a parent of P's parent, i.e., P's grandfather, then Z would be S's *great-grandfather*, which contradicts the statement that Z is S's grandfather).\n    *   Let P's spouse be M. Thus, Z is M's parent.\n*   We are also given that \"Z and W are married and are parents of R.\" This means Z is R's parent.\n*   Combining these facts, since Z is both M's parent and R's parent, M must be R.\n*   **Conclusion:** P is married to R. Consequently, S is the daughter of P and R.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each option based on the derived relationships and the 'at most once' marriage rule.**\n*   **A. X is the mother-in-law of R.**\n    *   X is a parent of P. P is married to R. Therefore, X is a parent-in-law of R.\n    *   If X is female, then X is the mother-in-law of R. This is *possible*.\n    *   Since X's gender is not specified, this statement is *not necessarily FALSE*.\n\n*   **B. P and R are not married to each other.**\n    *   From our deduction in Step 2, P *is* married to R.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"P and R are not married to each other\" *must necessarily be FALSE*.\n\n*   **C. P is a son of X and Y.**\n    *   P is a child of X and Y. P's gender is not specified.\n    *   If P is male, this statement is true. If P is female, it's false.\n    *   Since P's gender is not specified, this statement is *not necessarily FALSE*.\n\n*   **D. Q cannot be married to R.**\n    *   P and Q are siblings (children of X and Y).\n    *   P is married to R.\n    *   The problem states that \"Each of P, Q, R, S, W, X, Y and Z has been married at most once.\" Since R is already married to P, R has fulfilled the 'at most once' condition and cannot be married to anyone else.\n    *   Therefore, Q *cannot* be married to R. The statement \"Q cannot be married to R\" is *necessarily TRUE*.\n    *   A statement that is *necessarily TRUE* cannot be the answer to \"Which one of the following *must necessarily be FALSE*?\".\n\n**Discrepancy with Answer Key:**\nBased on rigorous logical deduction, option B is the only statement that *must necessarily be FALSE*. Option D is a statement that *must necessarily be TRUE*. However, as per instructions, the provided answer key (D) is considered correct. This implies a potential error in the question or the provided answer key, as the logical derivation unambiguously points to B."

          "Step 1: Identify all individuals and their initial stated relationships: X and Y are married with children P and Q. Z and W are married with child R. Note the constraint: 'Each person married at most once'.",

          "Step 3: Deduce P's spouse. Let P's spouse be M. From Step 2, Z is M's parent. From the initial statements, Z is also R's parent. Therefore, M must be R. This means P is married to R.",
          "Step 4: Consolidate the derived family tree: Z and W are parents of R. X and Y are parents of P and Q. P is married to R. S is the daughter of P and R.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate Option A: 'X is the mother-in-law of R'. X is P's parent, and P is married to R. So X is R's parent-in-law. If X is female, this is true. If X is male, it's false. Since X's gender is not specified, this statement is not necessarily false.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate Option B: 'P and R are not married to each other'. From Step 3, we deduced that P and R *are* married. Therefore, this statement *must necessarily be FALSE*.",
          "Step 7: Evaluate Option C: 'P is a son of X and Y'. P is a child of X and Y. P's gender is not specified. If P is male, this is true. If P is female, it's false. This statement is not necessarily false.",
          "Step 8: Evaluate Option D: 'Q cannot be married to R'. P and Q are siblings. P is married to R. Given the rule 'Each person married at most once', R cannot marry anyone else. Therefore, Q cannot be married to R. This statement is *necessarily TRUE*.",
          "Step 9: Conclude that the statement which *must necessarily be FALSE* is Option B, based on logical deduction. However, acknowledging the provided answer key, the analysis points to a discrepancy."
