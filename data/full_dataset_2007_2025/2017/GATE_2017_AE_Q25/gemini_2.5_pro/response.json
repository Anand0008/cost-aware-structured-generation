        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements regarding compatibility equations in elasticity.\\n\\n**Statement P: Strain compatibility equations must be satisfied in the solution of three-dimensional problems in elasticity.**\\n*   According to RAG Chunks 1, 2, 4, and 6, compatibility equations are fundamental requirements in elasticity. They ensure that a deformed body remains continuous, without gaps, voids, or overlaps. If a strain field does not satisfy these equations, it is physically impossible because no continuous displacement field can be derived from it. Therefore, statement P is **TRUE**.\\n\\n**Statement Q: Six strains are defined in terms of three displacement functions and can have arbitrary values.**\\n*   RAG Chunks 1, 2, and 6 explicitly state that the six strain components (three normal: $\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\epsilon_z$; three shear: $\\gamma_{xy}, \\gamma_{yz}, \\gamma_{xz}$) are derived from only three displacement functions ($u, v, w$). Because there are more strain components than displacement functions, the strains are not independent. They are mathematically linked, and thus cannot have arbitrary values. The compatibility equations are precisely these mathematical links that prevent arbitrary strain values. Therefore, statement Q is **FALSE**.\\n\\n**Statement R: Compatibility equations are an expression of the continuity of displacements.**\\n*   RAG Chunks 1, 4, and 6 clearly explain that compatibility is the physical requirement for a deformed body to remain continuous and coherent. This means the displacement functions ($u, v, w$) must be continuous and single-valued throughout the body. The compatibility equations ensure that the strain field corresponds to such a continuous and single-valued displacement field. Therefore, statement R is **TRUE**.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, statements P and R are true, while statement Q is false. Hence, option C is the correct answer."
