For a 3D elasticity solution to be physically meaningful, compatibility must be satisfied. So P is true.\\n\\nStatement Q: \"Six strains are defined in terms of three displacement functions and can have arbitrary values.\"\\nWe indeed define six strain components from three displacement components u, v, w. However, because there are more strain components than displacement components, they cannot be arbitrary; they are constrained by the compatibility relations. This is explicitly emphasized in the RAG: the six strains are not independent and cannot vary arbitrarily. Therefore Q is false.\\n\\nStatement R: \"Compatibility equations are an expression of the continuity of displacements.\"\\nBy definition, compatibility equations ensure that the displacement field is single-valued and continuous throughout the body, i.e., no voids or overlaps. Megson: they are an expression of the requirement that the body remains a coherent, continuous whole. Hence R is true.\\n\\nThus only P and R are true, corresponding to option C."
