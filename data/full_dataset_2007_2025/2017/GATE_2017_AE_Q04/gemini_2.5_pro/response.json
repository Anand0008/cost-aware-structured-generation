We need to find the values of `\\lambda` (eigenvalues) for which non-trivial solutions `y(x)` (eigenfunctions) exist, satisfying the given differential equation and boundary conditions.\n\nThe given differential equation is `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + k^2 \\lambda y = 0` with boundary conditions `y(0) = 0` and `y(1) = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the cases for `k^2 \\lambda`:\n\n1.  **Case 1: `k^2 \\lambda = 0` (i.e., `\\lambda = 0`)**\n    The ODE becomes `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0`.\n    Integrating twice, the general solution is `y(x) = Ax + B`.\n    Applying the first boundary condition `y(0) = 0 \\implies A(0) + B = 0 \\implies B = 0`.\n    Applying the second boundary condition `y(1) = 0 \\implies A(1) + 0 = 0 \\implies A = 0`.\n    This leads to the trivial solution `y(x) = 0`. Thus, `\\lambda = 0` is not an eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Case 2: `k^2 \\lambda < 0` (i.e., `\\lambda < 0`)**\n    Let `k^2 \\lambda = -\\alpha^2` for some real `\\alpha > 0`.\n    The ODE becomes `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - \\alpha^2 y = 0`.\n    The characteristic equation is `m^2 - \\alpha^2 = 0 \\implies m = \\pm \\alpha`.\n    The general solution is `y(x) = C_1 e^{\\alpha x} + C_2 e^{-\\alpha x}` or, equivalently, `y(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\alpha x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)`.\n    Applying `y(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) = C_1 = 0`.\n    So, `y(x) = C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)`.\n    Applying `y(1) = 0 \\implies C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha) = 0`.\n    Since `\\alpha > 0`, `\\sinh(\\alpha)` is never zero. Therefore, `C_2` must be `0`.\n    This leads to the trivial solution `y(x) = 0`. Thus, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n3.  **Case 3: `k^2 \\lambda > 0` (i.e., `\\lambda > 0`)**\n    Let `k^2 \\lambda = \\alpha^2` for some real `\\alpha > 0`.\n    The ODE becomes `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + \\alpha^2 y = 0`.\n    The characteristic equation is `m^2 + \\alpha^2 = 0 \\implies m = \\pm i\\alpha`.\n    The general solution is `y(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\alpha x) + C_2 \\sin(\\alpha x)`.\n    Applying the first boundary condition `y(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0`.\n    So, the solution simplifies to `y(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\alpha x)`.\n    Applying the second boundary condition `y(1) = 0 \\implies C_2 \\sin(\\alpha) = 0`.\n    For a non-trivial solution (i.e., `y(x)` is not identically zero), `C_2` must be non-zero. Therefore, we must have `\\sin(\\alpha) = 0`.\n    This implies that `\\alpha` must be an integer multiple of `\\pi`, i.e., `\\alpha = n\\pi` for some integer `n`.\n    Since we assumed `\\alpha > 0`, we consider `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`. (Note: `n=0` leads to `\\alpha=0`, which corresponds to `\\lambda=0`, already shown to be trivial. Negative integer values for `n` would yield eigenfunctions that are scalar multiples of positive `n` values, e.g., `\\sin(-n\\pi x) = -\\sin(n\\pi x)`).\n\n    Now, we find the eigenvalues `\\lambda_n` using `k^2 \\lambda = \\alpha^2`:\n    `\\lambda_n = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{k^2} = \\frac{(n\\pi)^2}{k^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{k^2}`.\n\n    The corresponding eigenfunctions `u_n(x)` (choosing `C_2 = 1` for simplicity) are:\n    `u_n(x) = \\sin(\\alpha x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, Option C provides the correct eigenvalues `\\lambda_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{k^2}` and eigenfunctions `u_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)`. The range `n = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...` in the option is a general way to list the index, but for distinct non-trivial eigenfunctions, `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is typically considered."

          "**Step 1: Identify the problem type and governing equation.** The problem is a Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem (SLBVP) defined by the second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation `$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + k^2 \\lambda y = 0$` on the interval `$(0, 1)$`, with Dirichlet boundary conditions `y(0) = 0` and `y(1) = 0`.",

Integrate twice to get the general solution `y(x) = Ax + B`. Apply the boundary conditions `y(0) = 0` and `y(1) = 0` to show that `A=0` and `B=0`, leading to the trivial solution `y(x) = 0`. Conclude that `$\\lambda = 0$` is not an eigenvalue.",
          "**Step 3: Analyze the case for `$\\lambda < 0$` (or `k^2 \\lambda < 0`).** Let `k^2 \\lambda = -\\alpha^2` for some real `$\\alpha > 0$`. The ODE becomes `$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - \\alpha^2 y = 0$`. The general solution is `y(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\alpha x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)`. Apply `y(0) = 0` to find `C_1 = 0`. Then apply `y(1) = 0` to `y(x) = C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)`. Since `$\\sinh(\\alpha) \\neq 0$` for `$\\alpha > 0$`, this forces `C_2 = 0`, resulting in the trivial solution `y(x) = 0`. Conclude that there are no negative eigenvalues.",
