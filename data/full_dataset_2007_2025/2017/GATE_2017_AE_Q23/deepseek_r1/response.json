        "reasoning": "An aircraft landing gear must absorb impact energy during touchdown and return to its equilibrium (static) position as quickly as possible without oscillating. Oscillations (underdamped) would cause the aircraft to bounce, compromising safety and passenger comfort. An overdamped system would return too slowly, failing to absorb repeated impacts effectively and potentially transmitting high loads to the airframe. Critical damping provides the fastest non-oscillatory return to equilibrium, which is the design goal for a landing gear shock absorber. The retrieved knowledge establishes the definitions of damping types and the mass-spring-damper model, making critical damping the clear choice for this application."

          "Step 2: Recall the response types of a SDOF system to an initial displacement or impact. Based on damping ratio ($\\zeta$): Undamped ($\\zeta=0$) oscillates forever; Underdamped ($0<\\zeta<1$) oscillates with decaying amplitude; Critically damped ($\\zeta=1$) returns to equilibrium fastest without oscillation; Overdamped ($\\zeta>1$) returns slowly without oscillation.",
          "Step 3: Analyze the design requirement for a landing gear. The key requirement is to settle (i.e., reach static equilibrium) after touchdown in the shortest time without any oscillatory motion (bouncing).",
          "Step 4: Match the requirement to the damping type. The critically damped response is characterized by the fastest approach to equilibrium without overshoot or oscillation, which is exactly the desired behavior for a landing gear shock absorber.",
          "Step 5: Eliminate other options. Underdamped causes bouncing; overdamped is too slow and may not adequately cushion subsequent impacts; undamped is perpetually oscillatory and unstable."
