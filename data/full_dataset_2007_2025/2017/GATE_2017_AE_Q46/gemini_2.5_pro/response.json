        "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the stage pressure ratio of an axial compressor using velocity triangle data and thermodynamic properties. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine tangential components of absolute velocity ($V_{w1}$, $V_{w2}$):** From the given velocity triangles, the relative flow angles $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are provided. The axial velocity ($V_z$) and peripheral blade speed ($U$) are also given. For an axial compressor rotor, the tangential components of absolute velocity are related to the relative flow angles by:\n    *   At inlet (1): $V_{w1} = U - V_z \\tan(\\beta_1)$\n    *   At outlet (2): $V_{w2} = U - V_z \\tan(\\beta_2)$\n\n    Given: $U = 200 \\text{ m/s}$, $V_z = 165 \\text{ m/s}$, $\\beta_1 = 45^\\circ$, $\\beta_2 = 11^\\circ$.\n    *   $V_{w1} = 200 - 165 \\tan(45^\\circ) = 200 - 165 \\times 1 = 35 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $V_{w2} = 200 - 165 \\tan(11^\\circ) = 200 - 165 \\times 0.19438 = 200 - 32.0727 = 167.9273 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the actual stagnation temperature rise ($\\Delta T_{st}$):** The actual work done on the fluid by the rotor per unit mass ($W_{actual}$) is given by the Euler turbomachinery equation. This work translates directly into a stagnation temperature rise.\n    *   $W_{actual} = U(V_{w2} - V_{w1})$\n    *   $\\Delta T_{st} = \\frac{W_{actual}}{C_p} = \\frac{U(V_{w2} - V_{w1})}{C_p}$\n\n    Given: $C_p = 1.005 \\text{ kJ/kgK} = 1005 \\text{ J/kgK}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_{st} = \\frac{200 \\times (167.9273 - 35)}{1005} = \\frac{200 \\times 132.9273}{1005} = \\frac{26585.46}{1005} = 26.45319 \\text{ K}$\n\n    *Note on the phrase 'Considering actual work in the rotor is equal to the ideal work': In the absence of a work-done factor ($\\lambda$), the Euler equation directly calculates the actual work done on the fluid. The given stage efficiency then accounts for the difference between this actual work and the ideal (isentropic) work required for the pressure ratio. Therefore, we proceed with the calculated $\\Delta T_{st}$ as the actual temperature rise.* \n\n3.  **Calculate the stage pressure ratio ($\\pi_{st}$):** The stage pressure ratio is related to the stagnation temperature rise, inlet stagnation temperature, and isentropic efficiency by the following relation:\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\eta_{stg} \\Delta T_{st}}{T_{st1}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n\n    Given: $\\eta_{stg} = 0.8$, $T_{st1} = 298 \\text{ K}$, $\\gamma = 1.4$.\n    *   Exponent: $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1.4}{1.4-1} = \\frac{1.4}{0.4} = 3.5$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.8 \\times 26.45319}{298}\\right)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{21.162552}{298}\\right)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = (1 + 0.071015275)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = (1.071015275)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} \\approx 1.2725$\n\nRounding to two decimal points, the pressure ratio for the stage is $\\mathbf{1.27}$.
