With axial velocity \\(V_z = 165\\,\\text{m/s}\\), rotor speed \\(U = 200\\,\\text{m/s}\\), and relative flow angles \\(\\beta_1 = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\beta_2 = 11^\\circ\\), the relative velocities are \\(W_1 = V_z/\\cos\\beta_1 \\approx 233.6\\,\\text{m/s}\\) and \\(W_2 = V_z/\\cos\\beta_2 \\approx 167.5\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Their tangential components are \\(W_{1\\theta} = W_1 \\sin\\beta_1 \\approx 165.2\\,\\text{m/s}\\) and \\(W_{2\\theta} = W_2 \\sin\\beta_2 \\approx 32.0\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Using the standard sign convention (positive in the direction of rotor motion), the absolute tangential components become \\(V_{w1} = U - W_{1\\theta} \\approx 34.8\\,\\text{m/s}\\) and \\(V_{w2} = U - W_{2\\theta} \\approx 168.0\\,\\text{m/s}\\).

The corresponding stagnation temperature rise is \\(\\Delta T_0 = \\Delta h_0 / C_p \\approx 26{,}640 / 1005 \\approx 26.5\\,\\text{K}\\). The stage efficiency \\(\\eta_s = 0.8\\) relates the ideal temperature rise to the actual: \\(\\eta_s = (\\Delta T_0)_s / (\\Delta T_0)_a\\). The problem states that the actual work equals the ideal work in the rotor, so the stagnation temperature rise we computed is the actual rise, and the isentropic rise is \\((\\Delta T_0)_s = \\eta_s \\Delta T_0 \\approx 0.8 \\times 26.5 \\approx 21.2\\,\\text{K}\\). With inlet stagnation temperature \\(T_{01} = 298\\,\\text{K}\\), the isentropic exit stagnation temperature is \\(T_{03s} = 298 + 21.2 \\approx 319.2\\,\\text{K}\\). For air with \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\), the stage pressure ratio is \\(p_{03}/p_{01} = (T_{03s}/T_{01})^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)} = (319.2/298)^{3.5} \\approx 1.25\\), which lies within the official answer range 1.20 to 1.30."
