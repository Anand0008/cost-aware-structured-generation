The stage efficiency of the compressor is 0.8. The stagnation temperature of air entering the stage is 298 K and the specific heat at constant pressure for air is 1.005 kJ/kgK. The ratio of specific heats for air is 1.4. Considering actual work in the rotor is equal to the ideal work, the pressure ratio for the stage is equal to ________ (in two decimal points)."
