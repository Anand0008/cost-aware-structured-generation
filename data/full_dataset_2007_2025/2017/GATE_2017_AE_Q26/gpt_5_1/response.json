        "reasoning": "To determine the nature of solutions of [A]\\{x\\} = \\{b\\}, we check if the coefficient matrix [A] is singular or non-singular. Compute the determinant of A:\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 2\\\\3 & 2 & 7\\\\3 & 1 & 5\\end{bmatrix}.\nUsing expansion along the first row:\n\\det(A) = 2\\begin{vmatrix}2 & 7\\\\1 & 5\\end{vmatrix} + 0\\cdot(\\cdots) + 2\\begin{vmatrix}3 & 2\\\\3 & 1\\end{vmatrix}.\nCompute the 2x2 determinants:\n\\begin{vmatrix}2 & 7\\\\1 & 5\\end{vmatrix} = 2\\cdot5 - 7\\cdot1 = 10 - 7 = 3,\n\\begin{vmatrix}3 & 2\\\\3 & 1\\end{vmatrix} = 3\\cdot1 - 2\\cdot3 = 3 - 6 = -3.\nSo \\det(A) = 2\\cdot3 + 2\\cdot(-3) = 6 - 6 = 0.\nThus A is singular (rank < 3). For a 3x3 system, this means the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. To distinguish, we compare rank(A) and rank([A|b]).\nForm the augmented matrix [A|b] = \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 2 & 4\\\\3 & 2 & 7 & 4\\\\3 & 1 & 5 & 5\\end{bmatrix}.\nPerform row operations:\n1) R2 := R2 - R1: [3-2, 2-0, 7-2, 4-4] = [1, 2, 5, 0].\n2) R3 := R3 - R1: [3-2, 1-0, 5-2, 5-4] = [1, 1, 3, 1].\nMatrix becomes \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 2 & 4\\\\1 & 2 & 5 & 0\\\\1 & 1 & 3 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.\n3) R3 := R3 - R2: [1-1, 1-2, 3-5, 1-0] = [0, -1, -2, 1].\nNow we have \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 2 & 4\\\\1 & 2 & 5 & 0\\\\0 & -1 & -2 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.\nThe left 3x3 part clearly has rank 3? Check: we already know det=0, so rank \\le 2. Continue elimination to see rank.\n4) Eliminate first column pivot: R1 := R1 - 2R2: [2-2, 0-4, 2-10, 4-0] = [0, -4, -8, 4].\nMatrix: \\begin{bmatrix}0 & -4 & -8 & 4\\\\1 & 2 & 5 & 0\\\\0 & -1 & -2 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.\n5) Swap R1 and R2 for clarity: \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 & 0\\\\0 & -4 & -8 & 4\\\\0 & -1 & -2 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.\n6) R2 := R2/(-4) = [0,1,2,-1].\n7) R3 := R3 + R2: [0, -1+1, -2+2, 1-1] = [0,0,0,0].\nSo the row-reduced form is \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 2 & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}.\nThe coefficient matrix A has two non-zero rows (rank(A) = 2). The augmented matrix [A|b] also has two non-zero rows (rank([A|b]) = 2). Since rank(A) = rank([A|b]) < number of unknowns (3), the system is consistent with infinitely many solutions.\nTherefore, the correct mathematical conclusion is that infinite solutions exist, which corresponds to option B. However, the official key lists B, while the detailed rank analysis confirms that is indeed correct. The earlier determinant test alone only told us the solution is not unique; the rank comparison confirms it is infinite, not inconsistent. So the logically correct option is B, and the official key is correct."
