        "reasoning": "The problem asks to determine the nature of solutions for the system of linear equations $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$. This is typically done by analyzing the determinant of the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the ranks of $\\mathbf{A}$ and the augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$.**\nGiven $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 \\ 3 & 2 & 7 \\ 3 & 1 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n$\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 2(2 \\times 5 - 7 \\times 1) - 0(3 \\times 5 - 7 \\times 3) + 2(3 \\times 1 - 2 \\times 3)$\n$\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 2(10 - 7) - 0 + 2(3 - 6)$\n$\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 2(3) + 2(-3)$\n$\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 6 - 6 = 0$\nSince $\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 0$, the system does not have a unique solution. It either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. We proceed to analyze the ranks.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the rank of $\\mathbf{A}$.**\nSince $\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 0$, the rank of $\\mathbf{A}$ is less than its dimension, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) < 3$. We check for a non-zero determinant of a 2x2 submatrix.\nConsider the top-left 2x2 submatrix: $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nIts determinant is $2 \\times 2 - 0 \\times 3 = 4 \\neq 0$.\nSince there exists at least one 2x2 submatrix with a non-zero determinant, $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) \\ge 2$. Combined with $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) < 3$, we conclude $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the rank of the augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]$.**\nThe augmented matrix is $[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\ 3 & 2 & 7 & 4 \\ 3 & 1 & 5 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nWe perform row operations to reduce it to row echelon form:\n1.  $R_2 \\rightarrow R_2 - \\frac{3}{2}R_1$\n2.  $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 - \\frac{3}{2}R_1$\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 2 & 4 & -2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3.  $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 - \\frac{1}{2}R_2$\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 2 & 4 & -2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThe number of non-zero rows in the row echelon form is 2. Therefore, $\\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]) = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the ranks and the number of variables.**\nWe have $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = 2$, $\\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]) = 2$, and the number of variables $n = 3$.\nAccording to the Rouch\\'{e}-Capelli theorem (or rank criterion for solutions):\n*   If $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]) = n$, a unique solution exists.\n*   If $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]) < n$, infinitely many solutions exist.\n*   If $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) \\neq \\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}])$, no solution exists.\n\nIn this case, $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{rank}([\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]) = 2$, which is less than $n=3$. Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions. This corresponds to option B."
