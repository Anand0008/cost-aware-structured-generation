          "Step 2: Recall the formula for dynamic pressure ($q$), which is the fundamental quantity linking these two airspeeds. Dynamic pressure is given by $q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$, where $\\rho$ is the air density and $V$ is the airspeed.",

The dynamic pressure at altitude (using actual density $\\rho$ and true airspeed $V_{TAS}$) must be equal to the dynamic pressure at standard sea-level (using sea-level density $\\rho_0$ and equivalent airspeed $V_{EAS}$). This gives: $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_{TAS}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 V_{EAS}^2$.",
          "Step 4: Simplify the equation by canceling common terms ($\\frac{1}{2}$) and rearrange it to express the ratio $\\frac{V_{EAS}}{V_{TAS}}$. This leads to $\\frac{V_{EAS}^2}{V_{TAS}^2} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}$.",
