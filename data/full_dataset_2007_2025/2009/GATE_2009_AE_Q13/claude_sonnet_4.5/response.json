This relationship is derived from the definition of equivalent airspeed, which states that the dynamic pressure at the equivalent airspeed and sea-level density is equal to the dynamic pressure at the true airspeed and actual density. Applying this principle, we can derive the formula $V_{EAS} = V_{TAS} \\sqrt{\\rho/\\rho_0} = V_{TAS} \\sqrt{\\sigma}$, which simplifies to the given expression in option C."
