The nozzle is optimally expanded, so $P_e = P_a$. The ramjet is ideal: isentropic intake and nozzle, constant total pressure combustion.",

Using isentropic relation: $T_{t4}/T_e = (P_{t4}/P_e)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} = (59.4)^{0.2857} \\approx 3.212$. Thus, $T_{t4} = T_e \\times 3.212 = 900 \\times 3.212 \\approx 2890.8$ K.",
