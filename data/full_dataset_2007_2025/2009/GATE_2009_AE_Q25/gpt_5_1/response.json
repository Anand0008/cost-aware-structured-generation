        "reasoning": "Specific thrust for an ideal ramjet (neglecting pressure thrust for optimal expansion) is given by \\(F_s = V_9 - V_0\\). For an ideal nozzle with constant \\(\\gamma\\), \\(V = M a\\) and \\(a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}\\). We are given: flight speed \\(V_0 = 1\\,\\text{km/s} = 1000\\,\\text{m/s}\\), ambient temperature \\(T_0 = 225\\,\\text{K}\\), and exhaust static temperature \\(T_9 = 900\\,\\text{K}\\). For an ideal ramjet with isentropic intake and nozzle and constant \\(\\gamma\\), the stagnation temperature is the same at inlet and nozzle entry, and the nozzle exit Mach number equals the flight Mach number when the exhaust is optimally expanded and the cycle is symmetric in Mach number. Thus \\(M_9 = M_0\\). Then\n\\[V_0 = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}, \\quad V_9 = M_9 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_9} = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_9}.\\]\nSo\n\\[F_s = V_9 - V_0 = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R}\\,(\\sqrt{T_9} - \\sqrt{T_0}).\\]\nWe can eliminate \\(M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R}\\) using \\(V_0\\):\n\\[M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R} = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}.\\]\nHence\n\\[F_s = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}(\\sqrt{T_9} - \\sqrt{T_0}).\\]\nSubstitute numbers: \\(V_0 = 1000\\,\\text{m/s}, T_0 = 225\\,\\text{K}, T_9 = 900\\,\\text{K}.\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{T_0} = \\sqrt{225} = 15\\), \\(\\sqrt{T_9} = \\sqrt{900} = 30\\). Then\n\\[F_s = \\frac{1000}{15}(30 - 15) = \\frac{1000}{15} \\times 15 = 1000\\,\\text{m/s} = 1000\\,\\text{N\\,s/kg}.\\]\nThis matches option A. This derivation is consistent with the ideal ramjet specific thrust expression in the RAG (e.g., \\(F_s = a_0 M_0 (\\sqrt{\\tau_b} - 1)\\)), which numerically gives the same result for the given temperatures."
