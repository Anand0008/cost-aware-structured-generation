The convention used here is: heat added to the system is positive, and work done by the system is positive.\n\n1.  **Identify given rates and mass:**\n    *   Mass of air, $m = 1 \\text{ kg}$\n    *   Rate at which piston does work *on* the air, $P_{\\text{work,on}} = 3000 \\text{ W}$. Since work is done *on* the system, the work done *by* the system is negative: $\\dot{W} = -3000 \\text{ W}$.\n    *   Rate at which heat is *lost* through the walls, $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 847.5 \\text{ W}$. Since heat is lost *from* the system, the heat added *to* the system is negative: $\\dot{Q} = -847.5 \\text{ W}$.\n    *   Time duration, $\\Delta t = 10 \\text{ s}$.\n\n2.  **Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics (rate form):**\n    $\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\dot{Q} - \\dot{W}$\n    $\\frac{dU}{dt} = (-847.5 \\text{ W}) - (-3000 \\text{ W})$\n    $\\frac{dU}{dt} = -847.5 \\text{ W} + 3000 \\text{ W}$\n    $\\frac{dU}{dt} = 2152.5 \\text{ W} = 2152.5 \\text{ J/s}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the total change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$):**\n    Since the rate of change is constant over the 10 seconds:\n    $\\Delta U = \\frac{dU}{dt} \\times \\Delta t$\n    $\\Delta U = 2152.5 \\text{ J/s} \\times 10 \\text{ s}$\n    $\\Delta U = 21525 \\text{ J}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the specific internal energy change ($\\Delta u$):**\n    Specific internal energy is total internal energy per unit mass:\n    $\\Delta u = \\frac{\\Delta U}{m}$\n    $\\Delta u = \\frac{21525 \\text{ J}}{1 \\text{ kg}}$\n    $\\Delta u = 21525 \\text{ J/kg}$\n\nThis result matches option A."
