At the same time, heat is being lost through the walls of the cylinder at a rate of 847.5 W. Using the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the specific internal energy of the air after 10 seconds can be calculated as:\n\n$\\Delta u = \\frac{Q - W}{m}$\n\nWhere:\n- $Q$ is the heat lost through the cylinder walls = -847.5 J/s × 10 s = -8475 J\n- $W$ is the work done by the piston = 3000 J/s × 10 s = 30,000 J\n- $m$ is the mass of air = 1 kg\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$\\Delta u = \\frac{-8475 J - 30,000 J}{1 kg} = 21,525 J/kg$\n\nThus, the change in the specific internal energy of the air after 10 seconds is 21,525 J/kg, which matches the correct answer A."
