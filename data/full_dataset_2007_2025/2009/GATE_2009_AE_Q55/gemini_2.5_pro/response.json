        "reasoning": "For a continuous system undergoing vibration, a 'fixed end' (or clamped end) implies that the displacement or rotation at that point is completely restrained and therefore zero. In the context of torsional vibration of a shaft, 'fixed' means that the angular displacement (rotation) at that end is zero. Since the shaft is fixed at both `x=0` and `x=L`, the angular displacement `$\\theta$` must be zero at both these locations. Therefore, the boundary conditions are `$\\theta(0) = 0$` and `$\\theta(L) = 0$`. This is explicitly stated in the retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1 and 2) under 'Fixed End (Clamped)' for a shaft."

          "Step 4: Formulate the boundary conditions based on the fixed ends. Since the shaft is fixed at `x=0`, the angular displacement at `x=0` must be zero, i.e., `$\\theta(0) = 0$`. Similarly, since it is fixed at `x=L`, the angular displacement at `x=L` must be zero, i.e., `$\\theta(L) = 0$`."
