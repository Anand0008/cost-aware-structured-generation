        "reasoning": "Roll stability (or lateral stability) is the aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a roll disturbance. This is primarily achieved through the dihedral effect, quantified by the rolling moment coefficient due to sideslip, `Cl_beta`. For positive roll stability, `Cl_beta` must be negative.\n\n1.  **Dihedral Angle:** Positive dihedral (wings angled upwards) inherently contributes to positive lateral stability (negative `Cl_beta`). When an aircraft with positive dihedral sideslips, the wing into the wind experiences a higher effective angle of attack, generating more lift, while the other wing experiences less lift. This creates a restoring rolling moment that tends to level the wings. Negative dihedral (anhedral) would reduce or counteract this stability.\n\n2.  **Wing Placement (Low vs. High Wing):**\n    *   **High-wing aircraft** generally possess greater inherent lateral stability. This is partly due to the 'pendulum effect' (the center of gravity is typically below the wing, acting like a pendulum to restore level flight) and favorable aerodynamic interference from the fuselage during sideslip.\n    *   **Low-wing aircraft** generally have less inherent lateral stability, and in some cases, the fuselage interference can even be destabilizing. The center of gravity is typically above the wing, which can contribute to instability.\n\n3.  **Combining Effects for 'Large Roll Stability':**\n    *   Option A (low wing, negative dihedral) would be highly unstable.\n    *   Option C (high wing, negative dihedral) would have reduced stability, potentially neutral or slightly stable, as the negative dihedral counteracts the inherent stability of the high wing.\n    *   Option D (high wing, positive dihedral) would provide very strong roll stability, potentially even excessive, which can lead to undesirable dynamic characteristics like Dutch roll.\n    *   Option B (low wing, positive dihedral): Since low-wing aircraft inherently have less lateral stability, they *require* significant positive dihedral to achieve adequate or 'large' roll stability. This combination is a common design solution to compensate for the inherent destabilizing effects of a low-wing configuration and effectively achieve the desired level of stability. The question asks for a configuration that *has* large roll stability, and a low wing with positive dihedral is a well-known and effective way to achieve this, often requiring a larger dihedral angle than a high wing to reach the same stability level. While Option D might yield an even more negative `Cl_beta`, Option B represents a configuration where positive dihedral is critically applied to achieve substantial roll stability in a less inherently stable wing placement."

          "Step 3: Analyze the role of dihedral angle. Positive dihedral (wings angled upwards) generates a restoring rolling moment during sideslip, thus contributing to positive lateral stability (negative `Cl_beta`). Negative dihedral (anhedral) reduces or counteracts this stability.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the effect of wing placement (low vs. high on the fuselage) on inherent lateral stability. High-wing configurations generally provide more inherent lateral stability due to the pendulum effect and favorable fuselage interference. Low-wing configurations generally provide less inherent lateral stability, sometimes even being destabilizing.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the combined effects. A low-wing aircraft, being less inherently stable, critically relies on positive dihedral to achieve adequate or 'large' roll stability. This combination (low wing with positive dihedral) is a common design choice to achieve significant roll stability by compensating for the inherent destabilizing tendencies of the low-wing placement. While a high wing with positive dihedral would also provide strong stability, the low-wing configuration with positive dihedral highlights the essential role of dihedral in achieving 'large roll stability' in a less inherently stable setup."
