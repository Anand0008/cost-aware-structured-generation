This is a fundamental characteristic derived from the fact that the expansion occurs through an infinite series of infinitesimally weak Mach waves, each of which is isentropic. Therefore, the entropy of the flow remains constant. Mach number increases, while static temperature, pressure, and density all decrease. This is directly stated in the retrieved knowledge chunks (e.g., Chunk 1: 'Since flow across a single Mach wave is isentropic... the cumulative process... is also isentropic'; Chunk 2: 'A Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan is a continuous, isentropic turning process... the entropy, stagnation pressure, stagnation temperature, and stagnation density all remain constant')."
