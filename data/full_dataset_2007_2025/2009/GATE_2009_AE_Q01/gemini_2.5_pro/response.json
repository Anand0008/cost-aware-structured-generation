        "reasoning": "Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves are characterized by an isentropic process. This means that the entropy (`s`) of the flow remains constant across the expansion fan. Multiple retrieved knowledge chunks (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) explicitly state that Prandtl-Meyer expansion is an isentropic process. In contrast, the Mach number increases, and static pressure, static temperature, and static density all decrease across an expansion wave (Chunk 1, 2, 5, 6). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

          "Step 3: Identify the thermodynamic characteristic. Flow across a single weak Mach wave is considered isentropic (no change in entropy). Consequently, the cumulative process across the entire Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan is also isentropic (Chunk 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).",

Option D (Density stays constant) is incorrect. Option B (Entropy stays constant) is correct because the process is isentropic."
