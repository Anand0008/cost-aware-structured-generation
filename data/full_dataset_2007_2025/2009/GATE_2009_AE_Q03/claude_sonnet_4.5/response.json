        "reasoning": "The question stem states that a trailing edge plain flap deflected downward increases the lift coefficient of an airfoil. Based on the retrieved knowledge, the primary mechanism for this is that the flap deployment effectively increases the airfoil's mean camber line, which in turn increases the lift coefficient (CL) at a given angle of attack and raises the maximum lift coefficient (CL_max) achievable before stall. This is explained in Chunk 4, which states that 'A plain flap is the simplest type of trailing-edge flap, consisting of a hinged portion of the wing's trailing edge that rotates downwards. Its primary mechanism for increasing lift is by effectively increasing the airfoil's mean camber line, which in turn increases the lift coefficient (CL) at a given angle of attack and raises the maximum lift coefficient (CL_max) achievable before stall.' This directly confirms that option A, 'Increasing the effective camber of the airfoil', is the correct answer."
