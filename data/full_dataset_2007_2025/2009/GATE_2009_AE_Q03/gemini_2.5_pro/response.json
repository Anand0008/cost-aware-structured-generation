          "Step 3: Analyze the effect of deflecting a plain flap downwards. When a plain flap is deflected, it effectively extends the chord line and, more importantly, increases the overall curvature or 'scoop' of the airfoil's mean camber line.",
          "Step 4: Relate increased camber to lift coefficient. An increase in the effective camber of the airfoil causes the airfoil to interact more aggressively with the airflow, diverting more air downwards. This results in a greater pressure difference and, consequently, a higher lift coefficient (C$_L$) at any given angle of attack.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding. Option A directly aligns with the primary mechanism described: 'Increasing the effective camber of the airfoil.' Options B, C, and D describe effects that are either secondary, incorrect, or more characteristic of other types of high-lift devices."
