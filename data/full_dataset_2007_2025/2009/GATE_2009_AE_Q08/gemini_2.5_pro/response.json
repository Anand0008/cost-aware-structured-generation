        "reasoning": "The propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) of a jet engine is defined as the ratio of the useful thrust power to the total power imparted to the jet. The useful thrust power is $F \\times U_\\infty$, where $F$ is thrust and $U_\\infty$ is flight velocity. The total power imparted to the jet is $F \\times U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $U_e$ is the exhaust velocity relative to the engine. \\n\\nUsing the thrust equation $F = \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)$ (assuming negligible pressure thrust and fuel mass flow), the propulsive efficiency can be derived as:\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{F \\times U_\\infty}{F \\times U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \\n\\nSubstitute $F = \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)$ into the denominator:\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty}{\\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \\n\\nCancel $\\dot{m}$ from all terms:\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{(U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty}{(U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \\n\\nDivide numerator and denominator by $(U_e - U_\\infty)$:\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{U_\\infty}{U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} (U_e - U_\\infty)}$ \\n\\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{2 U_\\infty + (U_e - U_\\infty)}$ \\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{U_e + U_\\infty}$ \\n\\nThis formula is directly provided in RAG chunks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, confirming option D as the correct answer.

RAG chunk 2 and 4 provide $\\eta_p = \\frac{2}{1 + V_e/V_\\infty}$, which is equivalent to option D by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $V_\\infty$ (or $U_\\infty$).\\n\\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2}{1 + \\frac{U_e}{U_\\infty}} = \\frac{2 \\times U_\\infty}{(1 + \\frac{U_e}{U_\\infty}) \\times U_\\infty} = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{U_\\infty + U_e}$"

          "Step 3: Express the total power imparted to the fluid ($P_{total}$) as the sum of useful thrust power and the kinetic energy lost in the exhaust jet. The kinetic energy lost in the jet is $\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $(U_e - U_\\infty)$ is the exhaust velocity relative to the ambient air. So, $P_{total} = F \\times U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2$.",

          "Step 6: Simplify the expression by canceling out $\\dot{m}$ and dividing both numerator and denominator by $(U_e - U_\\infty)$. This results in $\\eta_p = \\frac{U_\\infty}{U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} (U_e - U_\\infty)}$.",
          "Step 7: Further simplify the expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2: $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{2 U_\\infty + U_e - U_\\infty} = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{U_e + U_\\infty}$.",
