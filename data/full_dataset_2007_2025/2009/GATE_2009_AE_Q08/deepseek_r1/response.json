The correct expression is derived from the definition: \\eta_p = (Thrust Power) / (Thrust Power + Kinetic Energy Rate of Jet). For a simple turbojet model, assuming a negligible fuel-to-air ratio (f << 1) and no pressure thrust, thrust is T = \\dot{m}_a (U_e - U_\\infty). Thrust Power is T \\cdot U_\\infty = \\dot{m}_a (U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty. The power lost as kinetic energy in the jet is (1/2) \\dot{m}_a (U_e - U_\\infty)^2. Forming the ratio, cancelling \\dot{m}_a and (U_e - U_\\infty) leads to \\eta_p = (2 U_\\infty) / (U_e + U_\\infty). This matches option D.
