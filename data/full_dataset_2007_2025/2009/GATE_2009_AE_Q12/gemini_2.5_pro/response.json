        "reasoning": "A conventional altimeter operates on the principle of an aneroid barometer. It measures the ambient static air pressure, which decreases predictably with increasing altitude. The instrument contains sealed aneroid capsules that expand or contract with changes in external static pressure. This mechanical movement is then transmitted to display altitude. Since the altimeter's primary function is to sense pressure and convert it into a readable output (altitude), it is fundamentally a pressure transducer. The retrieved knowledge consistently supports this, stating that altimeters 'measure the ambient static air pressure' (Chunk 1), are 'based on sensed static atmospheric pressure' (Chunk 2), and 'sense static pressure from the static port' (Chunks 4, 5). Chunk 6 further defines pressure transducers as instruments for measuring pressure."
