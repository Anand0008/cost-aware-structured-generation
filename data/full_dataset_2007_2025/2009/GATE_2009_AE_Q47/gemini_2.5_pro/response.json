While the question specifically asks about finding the maximum of a function (which relies on monotonicity), not its integrability, the RAG context was helpful in reinforcing the core concept of monotonicity and its implications for function behavior on an interval. It did not provide specific differentiation rules for the given function, which was handled by internal knowledge."
