For thin-walled closed sections under a single shear resultant, the shear flow q is constant along each wall segment (St. Venant torsion / shear flow theory). The shear stress is given by $\\tau = q/t$, where t is the local wall thickness. Since the wall thickness of leg AB is uniform, $\\tau$ is constant and non-zero along AB. It cannot be zero because leg AB must transmit part of the shear flow needed to equilibrate the applied forces, and it does not vary linearly or parabolically because those distributions apply to solid sections, not thin-walled closed tubes with uniform thickness."

          "Step 4: Because the applied forces P are non-zero, the shear flow q in the tube is non-zero; otherwise, equilibrium of forces and moments could not be satisfied. Therefore, the shear stress along AB is non-zero.",
