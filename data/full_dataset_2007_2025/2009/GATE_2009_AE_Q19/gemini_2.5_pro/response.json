        "reasoning": "The problem describes a thin-walled rectangular tube subjected to equal and opposite forces P. These forces, applied at points B (upward) and D (downward), create a pure twisting moment (torque) about the longitudinal axis of the tube. For thin-walled closed sections under torsion, Bredt's theory (also known as Bredt-Batho theory) is applicable. This theory states that the shear flow, `q`, is constant around the entire perimeter of the tube. Shear stress `$\\tau$` is defined as shear flow divided by wall thickness, `$\\tau = q/t$`. Assuming a uniform wall thickness `t` (which is the standard assumption for 'thin-walled tube' unless specified otherwise), if `q` is constant, then `$\\tau$` must also be constant along the entire perimeter, including leg AB. Since the forces P are non-zero, the induced torque is non-zero, leading to a constant non-zero shear stress."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Identify the structural element and loading. The structure is a thin-walled rectangular tube (a closed section). The loading consists of equal and opposite forces P, applied at points B and D, which together form a couple. This couple induces a pure twisting moment (torque) on the tube about its longitudinal axis.",
          "Step 2: Recall the relevant theory for thin-walled closed sections under torsion. For such sections, Bredt's theory (or Bredt-Batho theory) is the governing principle. This theory assumes that the shear stress is uniformly distributed across the wall thickness and that the shear flow `q` is constant around the mean perimeter of the closed section.",
          "Step 3: Apply Bredt's formula for shear flow. The shear flow `q` in a thin-walled closed section subjected to a torque `T` is given by the formula `q = T / (2 * A_m)`, where `A_m` is the area enclosed by the mean perimeter of the cross-section. Since the forces P are non-zero and create a moment arm, the torque `T` is non-zero, and consequently, the shear flow `q` is also non-zero and constant around the perimeter.",
          "Step 4: Relate shear flow to shear stress. Shear stress `$\\tau$` is defined as the shear flow `q` divided by the wall thickness `t` (i.e., `$\\tau = q/t$`).",
          "Step 5: Determine the variation of shear stress. Given that the tube is 'thin-walled,' it is standard to assume a uniform wall thickness `t` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Since `q` is constant around the perimeter (from Bredt's theory) and `t` is constant, the shear stress `$\\tau$` must also be constant along the entire perimeter, including leg AB. As the torque is non-zero, the shear stress will be non-zero."
