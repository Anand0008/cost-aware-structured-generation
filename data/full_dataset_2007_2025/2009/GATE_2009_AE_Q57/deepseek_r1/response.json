This is based on the adiabatic flame temperature for typical hydrocarbon fuel combustion with air when sensible enthalpy of fuel is neglected. The energy balance simplifies to the heat release from fuel combustion equaling the enthalpy rise of the products. For stoichiometric conditions, the adiabatic flame temperature is approximately 2600 K, which falls within the range for jet fuels."
