        "reasoning": "The problem involves a simply supported beam of length `2L` with an overhang of length `L` on both sides, subjected to a clockwise end moment `M` at the far right end. To determine the bending moment distribution, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Coordinate System and Supports:**\n    Let the beam extend from `x=0` to `x=4L`.\n    The left end of the beam is at `x=0`.\n    The left support (pin) is at `x=L` (let's call its reaction `R_1`).\n    The right support (roller) is at `x=3L` (let's call its reaction `R_2`).\n    The right end of the beam is at `x=4L`, where the clockwise moment `M` is applied.\n\n2.  **Calculate Support Reactions:**\n    *   **Sum of vertical forces:** `$\\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies R_1 + R_2 = 0 \\implies R_2 = -R_1$`\n    *   **Sum of moments about the left support (at `x=L`), taking clockwise as positive:**\n        `$\\Sigma M_{x=L} = 0 \\implies R_2 \\times (2L) + M = 0$`\n        `$R_2 \\times (2L) = -M$`\n        `$R_2 = -M / (2L)$` (This indicates a downward reaction at the right support `S2`).\n    *   **From `R_1 + R_2 = 0`:**\n        `$R_1 = -R_2 = -(-M / (2L)) = M / (2L)$` (This indicates an upward reaction at the left support `S1`).\n\n3.  **Derive Bending Moment (M(x)) Equations for each section:**\n    We use the method of sections, considering the left part of the beam and taking counter-clockwise internal bending moment as positive.\n\n    *   **Section 1: Left Overhang (`0 \\le x < L`)**\n        Consider a cut at `x` from the left end. There are no external forces or moments in this section.\n        `$M(x) = 0$`\n\n    *   **Section 2: Between Supports (`L \\le x < 3L`)**\n        Consider a cut at `x` from the left end. The reaction `R_1` acts upwards at `x=L`.\n        `$M(x) - R_1 \\times (x - L) = 0$`\n        `$M(x) = R_1 \\times (x - L)$`\n        Substitute `R_1 = M / (2L)`:\n        `$M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (x - L)$`\n        This is a linear equation.\n        At `x = L` (left support): `$M(L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (L - L) = 0$`\n        At `x = 3L` (right support): `$M(3L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (3L - L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (2L) = M$`\n\n    *   **Section 3: Right Overhang (`3L \\le x \\le 4L`)**\n        Consider a cut at `x` from the left end. Reactions `R_1` and `R_2` are present.\n        `$M(x) - R_1 \\times (x - L) - R_2 \\times (x - 3L) = 0$`\n        `$M(x) = R_1 \\times (x - L) + R_2 \\times (x - 3L)$`\n        Substitute `R_1 = M / (2L)` and `R_2 = -M / (2L)`:\n        `$M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (x - L) + (-M / (2L)) \\times (x - 3L)$`\n        `$M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times [ (x - L) - (x - 3L) ]$`\n        `$M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times [ x - L - x + 3L ]$`\n        `$M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (2L)$`\n        `$M(x) = M$`\n        This is a constant positive bending moment.\n        At `x = 3L` (right support): `$M(3L) = M$` (Matches previous section)\n        At `x = 4L` (end of beam): `$M(4L) = M$` (Matches the applied end moment `M`)\n\n4.  **Sketch the Bending Moment Diagram:**\n    *   From `x=0` to `x=L` (left overhang): `M(x) = 0`.\n    *   From `x=L` to `x=3L` (between supports): `M(x)` increases linearly from `0` to `M`.\n    *   From `x=3L` to `x=4L` (right overhang): `M(x) = M` (constant).\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Option B shows a bending moment diagram that is zero in the left overhang, increases linearly from zero to a maximum positive value at the right support, and then remains constant at that maximum positive value in the right overhang. This perfectly matches our derived bending moment distribution."

          "description": "First, draw the load diagram. Then, integrate the load diagram to get the shear force diagram (V(x) = -∫w(x)dx). Finally, integrate the shear force diagram to get the bending moment diagram (M(x) = ∫V(x)dx). This method is particularly useful for distributed loads.",
          "pros_cons": "Pros: Visual, can be faster for complex distributed loads. Cons: Requires accurate integration and careful handling of constants of integration (which are determined by boundary conditions/point loads/moments). For point loads/moments, it involves jumps and changes in slope.",
          "when_to_use": "When dealing with distributed loads, or when a visual understanding of the cumulative effect of loads is preferred. For this problem, the method of sections is more direct due to the discrete nature of the load (an end moment)."

The core derivation relied on internal knowledge, but the RAG reinforced the general principles of beam analysis."
