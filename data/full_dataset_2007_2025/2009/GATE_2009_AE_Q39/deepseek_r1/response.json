The moment is zero at the simple support where the overhang begins (due to the support condition), increases linearly to a maximum (peak) at the other simple support, and then decreases linearly back to zero at the free end where the external moment is applied. This matches option B's description: 'Triangular distribution starting from zero at left support, peaking at right support, and zero at end.' The key is that with no other transverse loads, the shear force is constant, leading to a linear bending moment variation."

          "Step 4: Sketch the bending moment diagram. Start at the left simple support: bending moment is zero (simple support condition). Moving towards the right support, the moment varies linearly due to constant shear. At the right support (the support adjacent to the overhang), the bending moment reaches its maximum magnitude (peak).",
          "Step 5: On the overhang section, the bending moment continues to vary linearly. At the free end where the external moment M is applied, the internal bending moment must be zero (for equilibrium of a free end with no other force, the internal moment balances the external applied moment, resulting in a net zero internal moment at the very tip if we consider the internal moment just to the left of the applied moment). Thus, the diagram goes from the peak at the right support to zero at the free end, completing a triangular shape over the entire beam."
