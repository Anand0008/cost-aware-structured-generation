        "reasoning": "The beam has two simple supports separated by 2L and an overhang of length L to the right, with a pure end moment M applied at the free end. A pure moment does not create any net vertical force, so the support reactions are equal and opposite vertical forces whose line of action passes through the span between supports. For a statically determinate beam with only a couple applied, the internal bending moment between the supports is constant (no distributed load or shear), so the BMD over the 2L span is a straight line with constant magnitude. Over the overhang, there is no shear or additional load, so the bending moment varies linearly from its value at the right support to the applied end moment at the free end. At the left support, the bending moment must be zero because a simple support cannot resist a moment. Therefore, the BMD starts from zero at the left support, increases linearly to a constant nonzero value at the right support, and then decreases linearly back to zero at the free end where the applied couple is located (sign change at the end). Among the options, diagram (B) matches this: triangular distribution starting from zero at the left support, peaking at the right support, and returning to zero at the free end of the overhang."

          "Identify loading and supports: A simply supported span of length 2L with an overhang of length L to the right, and a pure end moment M applied at the free end of the overhang.",
          "Note that a pure moment (couple) produces no net vertical force. Therefore, the sum of vertical reactions at the two supports must be zero; one reaction is upward and the other downward with equal magnitude. There is no distributed load or point load along the beam.",
          "Between the two supports, the shear force is constant (equal to the reaction at the left support), but since there is no distributed load, the derivative of bending moment with respect to x is constant. However, because the net vertical load between supports is zero (one reaction up, one down), the internal bending moment between supports is actually constant in magnitude and sign.",
          "At a simple support, the bending moment is zero because the support cannot resist a couple. Thus, the BMD must be zero at the left support and at the right support if considered independently; but the presence of the applied end moment shifts the internal moment distribution so that only the left support has zero moment, while the right support carries a nonzero internal moment to balance the end couple.",
          "Over the main span from left to right support, with no distributed load, the bending moment varies linearly between its value at the left support (zero) and its value at the right support (maximum). This gives a straight-line increase, forming the rising side of a triangle.",
          "Over the overhang from the right support to the free end, again there is no distributed load, so bending moment varies linearly. It must reduce from its peak value at the right support to zero at the free end where the applied couple is located (the external couple cancels the internal moment). This forms the descending side of the triangle.",
          "Thus the overall BMD is triangular: zero at the left support, maximum at the right support, and zero again at the free end of the overhang. This matches option B."

        "notes": "RAG chunks focused on shear force and bending moment diagrams for beams under distributed loads, triangular and trapezoidal loading, and overhang optimization. While not directly about a pure end moment, they reinforced the relationships between load, shear, and bending moment and the qualitative shapes of BMDs. The specific configuration with a pure couple and overhang was answered mainly from internal knowledge."
