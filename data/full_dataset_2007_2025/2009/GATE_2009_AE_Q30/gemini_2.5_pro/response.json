Within the XZ-plane, the components $u$ (along X-body) and $w$ (along Z-body) can be resolved from $V_{xz}$ as:\n    $\\qquad u = V_{xz} \\cos\\alpha$\n    $\\qquad w = V_{xz} \\sin\\alpha$\n\n3.  **Combining the relations:** Substitute the expression for $V_{xz}$ from step 1 into the equations for $u$ and $w$ from step 2:\n    $\\qquad u = (V \\cos\\beta) \\cos\\alpha = V \\cos\\beta \\cos\\alpha$\n    $\\qquad w = (V \\cos\\beta) \\sin\\alpha = V \\cos\\beta \\sin\\alpha$\n\nTherefore, the complete set of relations for the body-fixed velocity components is:\n*   $u = V \\cos\\beta \\cos\\alpha$\n*   $v = V \\sin\\beta$\n*   $w = V \\cos\\beta \\sin\\alpha$\n\nComparing this derived set with the given options, option D matches perfectly."
