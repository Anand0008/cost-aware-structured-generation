In such flows, two scalar functions are commonly used to describe the velocity field: the velocity potential ($\\varphi$) and the stream function ($\\psi$).\\n\\n1.  **Velocity Potential ($\\varphi$):** For an irrotational flow, the velocity vector $\\mathbf{V}$ can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar velocity potential, i.e., $\\mathbf{V} = \\nabla\\varphi$. For an incompressible flow, the continuity equation states that the divergence of the velocity vector is zero, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0$. Substituting the definition of $\\mathbf{V}$ into the continuity equation yields $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla\\varphi) = 0$, which simplifies to Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2\\varphi = 0$.\\n\\n2.  **Stream Function ($\\psi$):** For a two-dimensional incompressible flow, a stream function $\\psi$ can be defined such that the velocity components are $u = \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}$ and $v = -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}$. This definition automatically satisfies the incompressibility condition. When the additional condition of irrotationality is applied (for 2D flow, this is $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$), substituting the stream function definitions gives $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0$. This simplifies to $-\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$, or $\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$, which is Laplace's equation for the stream function in 2D, $\\nabla^2\\psi = 0$.\\n\\nTherefore, both the velocity potential and the stream function satisfy Laplace's equation for two-dimensional irrotational and incompressible flows."
