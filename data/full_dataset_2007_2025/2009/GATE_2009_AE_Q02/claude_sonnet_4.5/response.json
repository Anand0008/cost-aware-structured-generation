Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, both the potential function (φ) and stream function (ψ) must satisfy Laplace's equation, ∇²φ = 0 and ∇²ψ = 0, respectively. This is because the flows are both irrotational (∇ × V = 0) and incompressible (∇ ⋅ V = 0), and these conditions lead to Laplace's equation for both the potential and stream functions.
