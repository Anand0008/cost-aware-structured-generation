        "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the natural frequency and damping characteristics of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rotational system. This involves calculating the equivalent rotational inertia, stiffness, and damping coefficient, then using these to find the natural frequency ($\\omega_n$) and damping ratio ($\\zeta$).\n\n1.  **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Mass of bar, $m = 1 \\text{ kg}$\n    *   Length of bar, $L = 1 \\text{ m}$\n    *   Spring stiffness, $k = 1 \\text{ N/m}$\n    *   Viscous damper constant, $C = 1 \\text{ N-s/m}$\n    *   Distance from pivot to spring/damper, $a = 1/\\sqrt{3} \\text{ m}$\n    *   Moment of inertia about pivot A, $I_A = mL^2/3$\n\n2.  **Calculate Rotational Inertia ($I_A$):**\n    $I_A = \\frac{mL^2}{3} = \\frac{(1 \\text{ kg})(1 \\text{ m})^2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$\n\n3.  **Calculate Equivalent Rotational Stiffness ($K_{eq}$):**\n    The spring is attached at a distance $a$ from the pivot. For a small angular displacement $\\theta$, the linear displacement at the spring attachment point is $x = a\\theta$. The restoring force is $F_k = kx = ka\\theta$. The moment due to the spring about the pivot is $M_k = F_k \\cdot a = (ka\\theta)a = ka^2\\theta$.\n    Therefore, the equivalent rotational stiffness is $K_{eq} = ka^2$.\n    $K_{eq} = (1 \\text{ N/m}) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ m} \\right)^2 = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m/rad}$\n\n4.  **Calculate Equivalent Rotational Damping ($C_{eq}$):**\n    The damper is also attached at a distance $a$ from the pivot. For a small angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$, the linear velocity at the damper attachment point is $v = a\\dot{\\theta}$. The damping force is $F_c = Cv = Ca\\dot{\\theta}$. The damping moment about the pivot is $M_c = F_c \\cdot a = (Ca\\dot{\\theta})a = Ca^2\\dot{\\theta}$.\n    Therefore, the equivalent rotational damping is $C_{eq} = Ca^2$.\n    $C_{eq} = (1 \\text{ N-s/m}) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ m} \\right)^2 = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s/rad}$\n\n5.  **Calculate Natural Frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    For a rotational SDOF system, the natural frequency is given by $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eq}}{I_A}}$.\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{1/3 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m/rad}}{1/3 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\text{ rad/s}$\n\n6.  **Calculate Critical Damping Coefficient ($C_{critical}$):**\n    The critical damping coefficient for a rotational system is $C_{critical} = 2I_A\\omega_n$.\n    $C_{critical} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\right) (1 \\text{ rad/s}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s/rad}$\n\n7.  **Calculate Damping Ratio ($\\zeta$):**\n    The damping ratio is $\\zeta = \\frac{C_{eq}}{C_{critical}}$.\n    $\\zeta = \\frac{1/3 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s/rad}}{2/3 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s/rad}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n\n8.  **Classify the System:**\n    Since $\\zeta = 0.5 < 1$, the system is **underdamped**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, Option B states \"underdamped with natural frequency $\\omega_n = 1 \\text{ rad/s}\"$, which perfectly matches our calculations."
