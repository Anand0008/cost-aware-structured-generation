The spring and damper are attached at distance \\(a\\) from A, so their linear deflection/velocity are \\(x = a\\theta\\) and \\(\\dot x = a\\dot\\theta\\). Hence the restoring moment from the spring is \\(k a^2 \\theta\\) and the damping moment is \\(C a^2 \\dot\\theta\\). The equation of motion about A is \\(I_A \\ddot\\theta + C a^2 \\dot\\theta + k a^2 \\theta = 0\\). Given \\(I_A = mL^2/3 = 1/3\\,\\text{kg m}^2\\), \\(k = 1\\,\\text{N/m}\\), \\(C = 1\\,\\text{N s/m}\\), and \\(a = 1/\\sqrt{3}\\,\\text{m}\\), we get equivalent rotational stiffness \\(K_{eq} = k a^2 = 1 \\times (1/3) = 1/3\\,\\text{N m/rad}\\) and equivalent damping \\(C_{eq} = C a^2 = 1/3\\,\\text{N m s/rad}\\). The undamped natural frequency is \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K_{eq}/I_A} = \\sqrt{(1/3)/(1/3)} = 1\\,\\text{rad/s}\\). The critical damping for this rotational system is \\(C_{cr} = 2 I_A \\omega_n = 2 \\times (1/3) \\times 1 = 2/3\\,\\text{N m s/rad}\\). The actual damping ratio is \\(\\zeta = C_{eq}/C_{cr} = (1/3)/(2/3) = 1/2 < 1\\), so the system is underdamped.
