        "reasoning": "The correct answer is A (P, Q, R). This is a fundamental concept in gas dynamics. For a stationary normal shock in an ideal gas flow: (P) Stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant due to conservation of total energy (adiabatic, no shaft work). (Q) Stagnation pressure ($P_0$) always decreases due to the irreversible nature of the shock, which increases entropy. (R) Entropy ($s$) must increase for a real shock wave, as per the second law of thermodynamics. Statements (S) and (T) are false; stagnation pressure does not increase, and stagnation temperature does not increase across the shock. The RAG context strongly and consistently supports these facts (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)."

Stagnation pressure represents the pressure achievable if the flow were brought to rest isentropically. Irreversibility reduces this potential. Hence, $P_{02} < P_{01}$. Therefore, Q is TRUE.",
