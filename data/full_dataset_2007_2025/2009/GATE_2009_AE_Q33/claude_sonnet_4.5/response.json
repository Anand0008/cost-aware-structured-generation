This is consistent with the fundamental principles of normal shock waves:\n\n1. Stagnation temperature (T0) is conserved across a normal shock, as shown by the energy equation and the fact that the shock process is adiabatic (no heat transfer).\n\n2. Stagnation pressure (P0) decreases across the normal shock due to the irreversible nature of the shock, which leads to an increase in entropy.\n\n3. Entropy must increase across a real, irreversible shock wave, as required by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nThe other statements, S. Stagnation pressure increases and T. Stagnation temperature increases, are incorrect. Stagnation pressure decreases, and stagnation temperature remains constant across a normal shock."
