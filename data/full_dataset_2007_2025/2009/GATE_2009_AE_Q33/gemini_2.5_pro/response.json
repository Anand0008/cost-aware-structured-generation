        "reasoning": "The question asks to identify true statements regarding flow across a stationary normal shock. Based on the fundamental principles of gas dynamics and the Rankine-Hugoniot relations for normal shocks:\n\n1.  **Stagnation temperature ($T_0$) stays constant (Statement P):** The energy equation for a control volume across a stationary normal shock, assuming adiabatic flow (no heat transfer) and no shaft work, shows that the stagnation enthalpy ($h_0 = h + \\frac{V^2}{2}$) is conserved. For an ideal gas, $h_0 = C_p T_0$, which implies that stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant across the shock ($T_{01} = T_{02}$). This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n2.  **Stagnation pressure ($P_0$) decreases (Statement Q):** A normal shock wave is an irreversible process. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy must increase across an irreversible process. This increase in entropy is directly linked to a decrease in stagnation pressure. Therefore, the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock ($P_{02}$) is always less than the stagnation pressure upstream ($P_{01}$). This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Statement S (Stagnation pressure increases) is therefore false.\n\n3.  **Entropy increases (Statement R):** As mentioned, a normal shock is an irreversible process. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that for any irreversible process occurring in an isolated system (or across a control volume with no external entropy transfer), the entropy of the system must increase. Thus, $s_2 > s_1$. This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n4.  **Stagnation temperature increases (Statement T):** This contradicts statement P and the conservation of stagnation temperature across a normal shock. While static temperature ($T$) increases across a normal shock, stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant. Therefore, statement T is false.\n\nCombining these, statements P, Q, and R are true. This corresponds to Option A."

For an ideal gas, this directly implies that stagnation temperature ($T_0$) is conserved ($T_{01} = T_{02}$). Thus, statement P is true, and T is false.",

The increase in entropy across an irreversible process like a normal shock is directly associated with a loss of useful work potential, which manifests as a decrease in stagnation pressure. Therefore, stagnation pressure ($P_0$) always decreases across a normal shock ($P_{02} < P_{01}$). Thus, statement Q is true, and S is false.",
