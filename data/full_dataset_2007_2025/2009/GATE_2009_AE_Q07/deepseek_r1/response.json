In plane strain, deformation is confined to a plane (e.g., xy-plane), meaning the strain components $\\epsilon_z$, $\\gamma_{xz}$, and $\\gamma_{yz}$ are zero. From the strain-displacement relations and Hooke's Law, zero shear strains imply zero corresponding shear stresses ($\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$). The condition $\\epsilon_z = 0$ leads to $\\sigma_z = \\nu(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$ for an isotropic material. The RAG context (Chunks 2 and 6) explicitly state these conditions and the derived relation for $\\sigma_z$. Option A incorrectly sets $\\sigma_z = 0$, which is the plane stress condition.
