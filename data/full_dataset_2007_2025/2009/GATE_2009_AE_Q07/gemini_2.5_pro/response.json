(Where `G` is the shear modulus)\n*   From `$\\gamma_{yz} = 0$`, we have `$\\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz} = 0$`. \n*   From `$\\epsilon_z = 0$`, and the Hooke's Law equation for normal strain in the z-direction: `$\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)]$`. Since `$\\epsilon_z = 0$`, this simplifies to `$\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$`, which means `$\\sigma_z = \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`.\n\nCombining these, the stress conditions for a plane strain problem are `$\\tau_{xz} = 0$`, `$\\tau_{yz} = 0$`, and `$\\sigma_z = \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`.
