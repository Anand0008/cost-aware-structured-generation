The velocity field of a point vortex is purely tangential with magnitude \\(v_\\theta = \\Gamma/(2\\pi r)\\). Each vortex is at distance \\(r = d\\) from the other, so the speed induced at one vortex by the other is \\(V = \\Gamma/(2\\pi d)\\), directed perpendicular to the line joining them. Thus each vortex moves on a circular path of radius \\(d/2\\) about the midpoint P. The angular speed is \\(\\omega = V/(d/2) = [\\Gamma/(2\\pi d)]/(d/2) = \\Gamma/(\\pi d^2)\\). The distance between vortices remains constant, so they do not spiral inwards or merge; they revolve perpetually.
