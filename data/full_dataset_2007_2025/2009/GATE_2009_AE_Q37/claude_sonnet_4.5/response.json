The vortices will revolve around each other, with the midpoint P as the center of rotation.\n3. The angular speed of the revolution is inversely proportional to the square of the distance d between the vortices, as per the Biot-Savart law for the velocity field induced by a point vortex.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong initial angular speed or state that the vortices will merge, which violates the conservation of vortex strength."
