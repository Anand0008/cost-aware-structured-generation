        "reasoning": "The motion of a point vortex is determined by the velocity induced at its location by all *other* vortices in the flow field. A vortex does not induce velocity on itself. For two point vortices of the same strength ($\\Gamma$) and same sign, separated by a distance $d$ in an ideal fluid:\n\n1.  **Velocity Induced by a Point Vortex:** The tangential velocity $v_\\theta$ induced by a point vortex of strength $\\Gamma$ at a radial distance $r$ is given by $v_\\theta = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$. The direction is tangential, perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex center to the point of interest.\n\n2.  **Setup:** Let Vortex 1 be at $x = -d/2$ and Vortex 2 be at $x = d/2$. The midpoint P is at the origin $(0,0)$. Both have strength $\\Gamma$ and the same sign (e.g., both counter-clockwise).\n\n3.  **Velocity Induced by Vortex 1 on Vortex 2:** Vortex 1 (at $-d/2$) induces a velocity at Vortex 2 (at $d/2$). The distance between them is $r=d$. Since both vortices have the same sign (e.g., counter-clockwise), Vortex 1 induces an upward (positive y-direction) velocity at Vortex 2. The magnitude is $V_{2,induced} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$.\n\n4.  **Velocity Induced by Vortex 2 on Vortex 1:** Similarly, Vortex 2 (at $d/2$) induces a velocity at Vortex 1 (at $-d/2$). The distance is $r=d$. Vortex 2 induces a downward (negative y-direction) velocity at Vortex 1. The magnitude is $V_{1,induced} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$.\n\n5.  **Resulting Motion:** Since Vortex 1 moves downwards and Vortex 2 moves upwards, and their linear speeds are equal, they will revolve around their common midpoint P. The radius of revolution for each vortex is $R = d/2$.\n\n6.  **Angular Speed Calculation:** The angular speed $\\omega$ is related to the linear speed $V$ and radius of revolution $R$ by $\\omega = V/R$.\n    Substituting the values:\n    $\\omega = \\frac{V_{1,induced}}{R} = \\frac{\\Gamma / (2\\pi d)}{d/2}$\n    $\\omega = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d} \\times \\frac{2}{d}$\n    $\\omega = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi d^2}$\n\nThis matches option D, which states that the vortices perpetually revolve about the midpoint P with radius of revolution $d/2$ and angular speed $\\Gamma/(\\pi d^2)$."

          "Step 1: Understand the principle of vortex interaction. The motion of a point vortex is determined by the velocity induced at its location by all *other* vortices in the flow field. A vortex does not induce velocity on itself.",

For a point vortex of strength $\\Gamma$, the tangential velocity $v_\\theta$ induced at a radial distance $r$ is given by $v_\\theta = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$. The direction is tangential, perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex center to the point of interest.",
          "Step 3: Set up the geometry based on the image. Let Vortex 1 be located at $x = -d/2$ and Vortex 2 at $x = d/2$. The midpoint P is at the origin $(0,0)$. Both vortices have the same strength $\\Gamma$ and the same sign (e.g., assume both are counter-clockwise, which means positive circulation).",
          "Step 4: Calculate the velocity induced by Vortex 1 on Vortex 2. Vortex 1 is at $x = -d/2$. It induces a velocity at the location of Vortex 2 ($x = d/2$). The distance between them is $r = d$. For two counter-clockwise vortices, Vortex 1 induces an upward (positive y-direction) velocity at Vortex 2. The magnitude of this induced velocity is $V_{2,induced} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the velocity induced by Vortex 2 on Vortex 1. Similarly, Vortex 2 is at $x = d/2$. It induces a velocity at the location of Vortex 1 ($x = -d/2$). The distance is $r = d$. Vortex 2 induces a downward (negative y-direction) velocity at Vortex 1. The magnitude of this induced velocity is $V_{1,induced} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$.",
          "Step 6: Determine the resulting motion. Since Vortex 1 moves downwards with speed $V_{1,induced}$ and Vortex 2 moves upwards with speed $V_{2,induced}$, and their linear speeds are equal, they will revolve around their common midpoint P. The radius of revolution for each vortex is the distance from the midpoint to the vortex, which is $R = d/2$.",
          "Step 7: Calculate the angular speed $\\omega$. The angular speed is given by the linear speed divided by the radius of revolution: $\\omega = \\frac{V}{R}$. Substituting the values: $\\omega = \\frac{\\Gamma / (2\\pi d)}{d/2} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d} \\times \\frac{2}{d} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi d^2}$.",
