The induced velocity magnitude is $v = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$, where d is the separation. This causes the vortices to revolve in circular paths about their stationary midpoint. The radius of revolution is $d/2$. The angular speed $\\omega = v / (d/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d} \\times \\frac{2}{d} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi d^2}$. The vortices do not merge because their strength is conserved (Helmholtz theorem), and in ideal fluid, they revolve perpetually. Option D matches this exactly."

          "Step 2: Apply superposition. Vortex 2 induces a velocity on Vortex 1. The distance between them is d, so the magnitude is $v_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi d}$. The direction is perpendicular to the line joining them (e.g., downward for Vortex 1 if both are positive and aligned horizontally). Similarly, Vortex 1 induces an equal magnitude but opposite perpendicular velocity on Vortex 2.",
          "Step 3: Determine the motion. The induced velocities are equal and opposite, causing the vortices to move in circular paths around their midpoint P. The midpoint remains stationary due to symmetry.",
          "Step 4: Calculate geometric parameters. The radius of the circular path for each vortex is half the separation: $R = d/2$.",

          "Step 6: Check conservation. In an ideal fluid (inviscid, incompressible), vortices conserve strength (Helmholtz theorem) and do not dissipate, so the motion is perpetual, not leading to merging."
