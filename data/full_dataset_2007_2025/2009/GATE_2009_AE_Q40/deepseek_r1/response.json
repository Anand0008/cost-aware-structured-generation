This results in one rigid body mode (zero frequency) and one elastic vibrational mode. The natural frequency for the elastic mode for such an unconstrained two-mass-spring system is derived from the equations of motion and is given by $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}}$.

          "Step 2: Write the equations of motion using Newton's second law. Let x1 and x2 be the displacements of m1 and m2 to the right. The force on m1 from the spring is $+k(x_2 - x_1)$ (pulling right if x2 > x1). The force on m2 is $-k(x_2 - x_1)$ (pulling left). Thus: $m_1 \\ddot{x}_1 = k(x_2 - x_1)$ and $m_2 \\ddot{x}_2 = -k(x_2 - x_1)$.",
          "Step 3: Assume harmonic motion: $x_1 = X_1 e^{i\\omega t}$, $x_2 = X_2 e^{i\\omega t}$. Substitute into the equations to get: $-m_1 \\omega^2 X_1 = k(X_2 - X_1)$ and $-m_2 \\omega^2 X_2 = -k(X_2 - X_1)$.",
          "Step 4: Rearrange into a standard eigenvalue form $[\\mathbf{K} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M}]\\mathbf{X} = 0$: $(-\\omega^2 m_1 + k)X_1 - k X_2 = 0$ and $-k X_1 + (-\\omega^2 m_2 + k)X_2 = 0$. In matrix form: $\\begin{bmatrix} k - \\omega^2 m_1 & -k \\\\ -k & k - \\omega^2 m_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{Bmatrix} = 0$.",
          "Step 5: For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero: $(k - \\omega^2 m_1)(k - \\omega^2 m_2) - k^2 = 0$.",
          "Step 6: Expand the determinant: $k^2 - k\\omega^2 m_1 - k\\omega^2 m_2 + \\omega^4 m_1 m_2 - k^2 = 0$ $\\Rightarrow -k\\omega^2 (m_1 + m_2) + \\omega^4 m_1 m_2 = 0$.",
          "Step 7: Factor out $\\omega^2$: $\\omega^2 [ -k(m_1 + m_2) + \\omega^2 m_1 m_2 ] = 0$. This yields two solutions: $\\omega^2 = 0$ (rigid body translation mode) and $\\omega^2 = \\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}$ (elastic vibrational mode).",

The relevant formulas and methods from the chunks provided a supportive background, but the core solution relied on internal knowledge of the standard result and its derivation."
