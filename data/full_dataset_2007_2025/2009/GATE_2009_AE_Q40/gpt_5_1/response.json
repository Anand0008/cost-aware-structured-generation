        "reasoning": "The system consists of two masses m1 and m2 on a frictionless surface connected only by a single spring of stiffness k between them, with no springs to ground. Hence a rigid-body motion where both masses translate together without changing the spring length has zero restoring force, giving one natural frequency of 0. For the vibratory mode, let x1 and x2 be displacements of m1 and m2. The spring force is k(x2 - x1). Taking positive to the right, equations of motion are m1 x1'' = k(x2 - x1) and m2 x2'' = -k(x2 - x1). Rearranging: m1 x1'' + k(x1 - x2) = 0 and m2 x2'' + k(x2 - x1) = 0. Assume harmonic motion x1 = X1 e^{i\\omega t}, x2 = X2 e^{i\\omega t}. This yields the algebraic system: (-m1 \\omega^2 + k) X1 - k X2 = 0 and -k X1 + (-m2 \\omega^2 + k) X2 = 0. For non-trivial solutions, determinant must vanish: (-m1 \\omega^2 + k)(-m2 \\omega^2 + k) - k^2 = 0. Expanding: m1 m2 \\omega^4 - k(m1 + m2) \\omega^2 = 0. Factorizing: \\omega^2 (m1 m2 \\omega^2 - k(m1 + m2)) = 0. Thus \\omega_1 = 0 and \\omega_2^2 = k(m1 + m2)/(m1 m2). This matches option A."
