        "reasoning": "The problem states that the nozzle is choked, the total pressure ($P_0$) remains the same, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) remains the same, and the specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$) remains constant. For a choked nozzle, the mass flow rate equation is given by: \\($\\dot{m} = A_{throat} \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}\\$). Since $\\dot{m}$, $P_0$, $\\gamma$, and $R$ (gas constant) are all constant, the term $\\frac{A_{throat}}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$ must remain constant. Therefore, the nozzle throat area is directly proportional to the square root of the total temperature ($A_{throat} \\propto \\sqrt{T_0}$). We need to find the factor by which the nozzle area changes, which is the ratio $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}}$. This can be expressed as $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{0,on}}{T_{0,off}}}$. Given $T_{0,off} = 750\\text{ K}$ and $T_{0,on} = 3000\\text{ K}$, we calculate the ratio as $\\sqrt{\\frac{3000}{750}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. Thus, the nozzle area must be changed by a factor of 2."

The exhaust gas temperatures are $T_{0,off} = 750\\text{ K}$ and $T_{0,on} = 3000\\text{ K}$.",
          "Step 2: Recall the mass flow rate equation for a choked nozzle. For a choked nozzle, the mass flow rate is given by: \\($\\dot{m} = A_{throat} \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}\\$).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the constants in the mass flow rate equation. The question states that $\\dot{m}$, $P_0$, and $\\gamma$ are constant. The gas constant $R$ is also constant. Therefore, the entire term $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$ is constant.",
          "Step 4: Establish the relationship between nozzle area and total temperature. Since the other terms are constant, for $\\dot{m}$ to remain constant, the product $\\frac{A_{throat}}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$ must be constant. This implies $A_{throat} \\propto \\sqrt{T_0}$.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the ratio of nozzle areas. The factor by which the nozzle area must be changed is $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}}$. Using the proportionality, this ratio is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{T_{0,on}}{T_{0,off}}}$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the given temperature values and compute the result. $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3000\\text{ K}}{750\\text{ K}}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$."
