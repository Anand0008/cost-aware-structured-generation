For choked flow (M = 1), substitute the critical temperature and pressure ratios to derive the standard choked mass flow formula, then obtain the A_t ∝ √T0 relation.",

The exact square-root dependence and numerical ratio were supplied from internal knowledge, but fully aligned with the RAG context."
