        "reasoning": "For ideal (inviscid, incompressible) flow, Bernoulli's equation states total pressure is constant along a streamline, and the continuity equation relates velocities at different cross-sections. At section (1), total pressure p01 = p1 + 1/2 ρ V1^2. At section (2), p02 = p2 + 1/2 ρ V2^2. Since total pressure is constant, p01 = p02. From continuity for incompressible flow: A1 V1 = A2 V2, giving V2 = (A1/A2) V1. Substituting yields p2 - p1 = 1/2 ρ V1^2 (1 - (A1/A2)^2), which matches option B. The diagram confirms A2 > A1, so the pressure drop is positive."
