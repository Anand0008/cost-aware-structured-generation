        "reasoning": "The question states that the specific heats of air at constant pressure and volume are $c_p = 1004.5$ J/kg-K and $c_v = 717.5$ J/kg-K, respectively. Using the given information, we can calculate the corresponding change in temperature of the air.\n\nFrom Mayer's relation, we have:\n$c_p - c_v = R$\nRearranging, we get:\n$c_v = c_p - R$\n$c_v = 1004.5 - 287 = 717.5$ J/kg-K\n\nThis matches the given value, confirming the consistency of the information provided.\n\nThe question is asking for the change in temperature of the air. Since the specific heat values are given, we can use the formula:\n$\\Delta T = \\frac{Q}{m c_p}$\nwhere $Q$ is the heat added, $m$ is the mass of the air, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe question does not provide the value of $Q$ or $m$, but it states that the change in specific internal energy of the air is 30,000 J/kg. Since the process is at constant pressure, the change in specific enthalpy is equal to the change in specific internal energy, which is 30,000 J/kg.\n\nUsing the formula $\\Delta h = c_p \\Delta T$, we can solve for the change in temperature:\n$\\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta h}{c_p} = \\frac{30,000}{1004.5} = 30$ K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 30 K."
