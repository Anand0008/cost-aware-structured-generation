        "reasoning": "This question is linked to a previous question (Q.59) which asks for the change in specific internal energy. To solve Q.60, we first need the result from Q.59.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the change in total internal energy ($\\Delta U$) for the air (from linked Q.59 context).**\n*   The system is 1 kg of air in a cylinder.\n*   Work done *on* the air by the piston is 3000 W. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics convention ($\\Delta U = Q - W$, where $W$ is work done *by* the system), work done *on* the system is negative work *by* the system. So, $\\dot{W} = -3000$ W.\n*   Heat is lost *from* the air through the walls at a rate of 847.5 W. According to the First Law convention, heat lost *from* the system is negative heat *added to* the system. So, $\\dot{Q} = -847.5$ W.\n*   The process occurs for a duration of $t = 10$ seconds.\n*   Total work done *by* the system: $W = \\dot{W} \\times t = (-3000 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -30000 \\text{ J}$.\n*   Total heat added *to* the system: $Q = \\dot{Q} \\times t = (-847.5 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -8475 \\text{ J}$.\n*   Applying the First Law of Thermodynamics: $\\Delta U = Q - W = (-8475 \\text{ J}) - (-30000 \\text{ J}) = -8475 \\text{ J} + 30000 \\text{ J} = 21525 \\text{ J}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the change in specific internal energy ($\\Delta u$).**\n*   Given mass of air $m = 1$ kg.\n*   $\\Delta u = \\Delta U / m = 21525 \\text{ J} / 1 \\text{ kg} = 21525 \\text{ J/kg}$. (This is the answer to Q.59).\n\n**Step 3: Relate specific internal energy change to temperature change (for Q.60).**\n*   For an ideal gas, the change in specific internal energy is related to the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$) and the change in temperature ($\\Delta T$) by the formula: $\\Delta u = c_v \\Delta T$.\n*   Given $c_v = 717.5$ J/kg-K.\n*   Rearranging the formula to find $\\Delta T$: $\\Delta T = \\Delta u / c_v$.\n*   Substituting the values: $\\Delta T = 21525 \\text{ J/kg} / 717.5 \\text{ J/kg-K} = 30 \\text{ K}$.\n\nThis result matches option (C)."

          "**Step 1: Identify the System and Process.** The system is 1 kg of air inside a cylinder, undergoing compression by a piston. The image shows this setup. Work is done *on* the air, and heat is *lost* from the air.",
          "**Step 2: Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics for a Closed System.** The First Law states that the change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) equals the heat added to the system ($Q$) minus the work done by the system ($W$). The standard convention is $\\Delta U = Q - W$.",
          "**Step 3: Convert Power Rates to Total Energy.** The problem provides rates (power) in Watts (J/s) and a duration of 10 seconds. To get total energy (Joules), multiply the rates by time. Pay close attention to sign conventions:\n    *   Work done *on* the air (3000 W) means work done *by* the air is negative: $\\dot{W} = -3000$ W. So, $W = (-3000 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -30000 \\text{ J}$.\n    *   Heat lost *from* the air (847.5 W) means heat added *to* the air is negative: $\\dot{Q} = -847.5$ W. So, $Q = (-847.5 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -8475 \\text{ J}$.",
          "**Step 4: Calculate the Change in Total Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$).** Substitute the calculated $Q$ and $W$ into the First Law equation:\n    *   $\\Delta U = Q - W = (-8475 \\text{ J}) - (-30000 \\text{ J}) = 21525 \\text{ J}$.",
          "**Step 5: Calculate the Change in Specific Internal Energy ($\\Delta u$).** Since the mass of air ($m$) is 1 kg, the change in specific internal energy is simply the total internal energy change divided by mass:\n    *   $\\Delta u = \\Delta U / m = 21525 \\text{ J} / 1 \\text{ kg} = 21525 \\text{ J/kg}$. (This is the result for the linked Q.59).",
          "**Step 6: Relate Specific Internal Energy Change to Temperature Change (for Q.60).** For an ideal gas (air is treated as an ideal gas), the change in specific internal energy is directly proportional to the change in temperature ($\\Delta T$) through the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$):\n    *   $\\Delta u = c_v \\Delta T$.",
          "**Step 7: Solve for the Change in Temperature ($\\Delta T$).** Rearrange the formula from Step 6 and substitute the known values:\n    *   $\\Delta T = \\Delta u / c_v = 21525 \\text{ J/kg} / 717.5 \\text{ J/kg-K} = 30 \\text{ K}$.",
