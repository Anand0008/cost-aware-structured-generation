        "reasoning": "The question asks for the purposes of dividing feed air into primary and secondary streams in an aircraft gas-turbine combustor. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n*   **P. a flammable mixture can be formed:** The retrieved knowledge (Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6) clearly states that the primary zone receives only a fraction of the total air, creating an air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio close to stoichiometric (typically 15:1). This near-stoichiometric mixture is highly flammable and ensures stable, efficient, and rapid combustion. Without this division, the overall A/F ratio (60:1 to 120:1) would be too lean to sustain a stable flame. Therefore, statement P is a direct and critical purpose.\n\n*   **Q. cooling of combustor liner and flame tube can be accomplished:** While the primary function of the secondary and dilution air is to complete combustion and cool the hot gases to the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), a significant portion of this air also flows along the inner surface of the combustor liner (flame tube) before mixing with the combustion products. This creates a cooling film, protecting the liner walls from the extremely high temperatures within the combustion zone. Chunk 5 mentions 'air is admitted into the liner through a series of carefully designed holes or slots' and discusses 'structural considerations' related to temperature, implying liner cooling is a vital aspect. This is a well-established secondary purpose of the air division.\n\n*   **R. specific fuel consumption can be reduced:** Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) is a performance metric that depends on the overall efficiency of the engine cycle, including component efficiencies (compressor, turbine, combustor). While efficient combustion (enabled by the zonal air division) contributes to better overall engine efficiency and thus lower SFC, the *division of air streams itself* is not a direct mechanism for reducing SFC. Its direct purposes are to enable stable combustion and control temperature. SFC reduction is an *indirect consequence* of the overall efficient operation that the zonal design facilitates, rather than a direct purpose of the air division strategy.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements P and Q are direct purposes of dividing the feed air. Hence, option C is the correct answer."

          "Step 1: Understand the context of the question, which pertains to the design and function of a gas turbine combustor, specifically the division of incoming air.",
          "Step 2: Recall the 'three-zone combustor design' principle, which involves primary, secondary (intermediate), and dilution zones, each receiving a specific portion of the total airflow (as described in Chunks 1, 3, 4, 6).",
          "Step 3: Analyze the purpose of the primary air stream. The primary air is mixed with fuel to create a near-stoichiometric mixture (A/F ratio around 15:1). This is essential because the overall engine A/F ratio (60:1 to 120:1) is too lean for stable combustion. This directly addresses statement P, 'a flammable mixture can be formed'.",
          "Step 4: Analyze the purpose of the secondary and dilution air streams. The secondary air completes combustion and begins cooling the gases. The dilution air primarily cools the combustion products to the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT). However, a crucial secondary function of these air streams, particularly the air introduced through the liner walls, is to cool the combustor liner (flame tube) itself, protecting it from the high flame temperatures. This directly addresses statement Q, 'cooling of combustor liner and flame tube can be accomplished'.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate statement R, 'specific fuel consumption can be reduced'. While efficient combustion (facilitated by the zonal design) contributes to better engine performance and thus lower SFC, the division of air streams is not a direct mechanism for SFC reduction. It's an enabling factor for efficient combustion, which then indirectly impacts SFC. Therefore, R is not a direct purpose.",
