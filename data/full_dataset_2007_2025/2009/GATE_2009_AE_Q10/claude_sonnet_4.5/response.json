Based on the information provided in the retrieved knowledge, the key purposes are:\n\n1. To form a flammable mixture in the primary zone by maintaining a near-stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (around 15:1). This ensures stable, efficient, and rapid combustion (from Chunk 1 and Chunk 3).\n\n2. To provide additional air in the secondary zone to complete the combustion of any unburnt fuel or intermediate species like CO, and to begin the process of lowering the gas temperature (from Chunk 1 and Chunk 3).\n\nThe third option, 'specific fuel consumption can be reduced', is not a direct purpose of this air staging. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 'P and Q'."
