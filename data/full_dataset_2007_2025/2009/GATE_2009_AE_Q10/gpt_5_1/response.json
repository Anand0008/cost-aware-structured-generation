        "reasoning": "In aircraft gas-turbine combustors, the total compressor air is introduced in stages: primary, secondary (intermediate), and dilution. From the RAG (Ganesan, Gas Turbines, Ch. 10), the primary zone uses only about 15–20% of the air to keep the local air–fuel ratio near stoichiometric (~15:1) so that a stable, flammable mixture is formed and combustion can be sustained. This directly supports statement P. The remaining air is introduced downstream as secondary and dilution air. A significant part of this secondary/dilution air is used for cooling the combustor liner and flame tube by film cooling and mixing, as well as for reducing gas temperature to the turbine inlet limit. This supports statement Q. Specific fuel consumption (SFC) is mainly governed by overall cycle parameters (pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, component efficiencies). While good combustor design avoids losses, the basic division into primary and secondary streams is not done with the primary aim of reducing SFC; it is done to ensure flame stability, complete combustion, and temperature/liner control. Therefore R is not a primary purpose in the sense intended by the question. Hence only P and Q are correct, corresponding to option C."

          "Step 3: The remaining air is introduced downstream as secondary and dilution air. This extra air completes combustion and, importantly, cools the hot gases and the combustor liner/flame tube via mixing and film cooling. This validates statement Q.",

While proper combustion avoids extra losses, the division into primary and secondary streams is not fundamentally for reducing SFC; it is for flame stability, complete combustion, and temperature/liner protection.",
