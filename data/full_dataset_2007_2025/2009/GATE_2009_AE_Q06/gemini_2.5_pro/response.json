        "reasoning": "A homogeneous system of linear equations `[A]{x} = {0}` always possesses the trivial solution `x = 0`. A non-trivial solution (where `x \\neq 0`) exists if and only if the coefficient matrix `A` is singular. For a square `n \\times n` matrix `A`, the following statements are equivalent:\n1.  The matrix `A` is singular.\n2.  The determinant of `A` is zero (`det(A) = 0`).\n3.  The rank of `A` is less than `n` (`rank(A) < n`).\n4.  The nullity of `A` is greater than zero (`nullity(A) > 0`).\n5.  The homogeneous system `[A]{x} = {0}` has non-trivial solutions.\n6.  At least one eigenvalue of `A` is equal to zero.\n\nSpecifically, if `\\lambda = 0` is an eigenvalue of `A`, then by the definition of an eigenvalue and eigenvector, there exists a non-zero vector `x` (the eigenvector) such that `A x = \\lambda x`. Substituting `\\lambda = 0`, we get `A x = 0 \\cdot x = 0`. Since `x` is a non-zero eigenvector, this `x` is a non-trivial solution to `A x = 0`. Conversely, if `A x = 0` has a non-trivial solution `x \\neq 0`, then `x` is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `\\lambda = 0`.\n\nTherefore, a non-trivial solution to `[A]{x} = {0}` exists if and only if `[A]` has at least one eigenvalue equal to zero. This directly matches option D.\n\nLet's analyze other options:\n*   **A. can never be found:** Incorrect. Non-trivial solutions can be found under the conditions mentioned above.\n*   **B. may be found only if [A] is not singular:** Incorrect. If `[A]` is *not* singular (i.e., invertible), then `det(A) \\neq 0`. In this case, `A^{-1}` exists, and multiplying `A x = 0` by `A^{-1}` yields `x = A^{-1} 0 = 0`. Thus, only the trivial solution exists if `A` is non-singular.\n*   **C. may be found only if [A] is an orthogonal matrix:** Incorrect. An orthogonal matrix `[A]` by definition has `A^T A = I`, which implies `det(A^T A) = det(I) = 1`. Since `det(A^T) = det(A)`, we have `(det(A))^2 = 1`, so `det(A) = \\pm 1`. As `det(A) \\neq 0`, an orthogonal matrix is always non-singular, and therefore, `[A]{x} = {0}` will only have the trivial solution."
