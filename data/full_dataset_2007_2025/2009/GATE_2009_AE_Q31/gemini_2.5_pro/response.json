First, calculate the weight of the aircraft: $W = m \\times g$. Given mass $m = 2500 \\text{ kg}$ and using standard acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$, the weight is $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 24500 \\text{ N}$. Then, apply the rate of climb formula: $V_c = P_{excess} / W = (1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}) / (24500 \\text{ N}) \\approx 40.816 \\text{ m/s}$. This value is closest to 40 m/s, which corresponds to option C. If $g=10 \\text{ m/s}^2$ is assumed for simplicity (common in some GATE problems for clean integer answers), then $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 25000 \\text{ N}$, leading to $V_c = (1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}) / (25000 \\text{ N}) = 40 \\text{ m/s}$ exactly."

The constant speed ($V = 100 \\text{ m/s}$) is given but not directly used in the calculation of rate of climb from excess power.",

For this problem, using $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$ yields $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 24500 \\text{ N}$.",
