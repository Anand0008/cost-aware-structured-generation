Based on gas turbine combustor design, for a turbine inlet temperature of 1550 K, a balanced distribution between primary and secondary air streams is often used to ensure stable combustion and proper temperature dilution. Standard references suggest that primary and secondary air flows can be comparable in such scenarios, leading to a 1:1 ratio.
