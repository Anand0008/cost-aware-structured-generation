        "reasoning": "Gas turbine combustors are designed with distinct zones for primary, secondary, and dilution air. The primary zone receives air for stable, near-stoichiometric combustion. The secondary zone receives air to complete combustion and begin cooling. The dilution zone receives the majority of the air to cool the gases to the desired Turbine Inlet Temperature (TET). While specific percentages vary by design and manufacturer, a common approximate distribution for the primary and secondary air streams is that they handle roughly equal proportions of the total airflow, each constituting about 25-30% of the total air. The remaining 40-50% is dilution air. Therefore, the ratio of primary to secondary air mass flow rates can be approximated as 1:1. The high TET of 1550 K indicates a modern, high-performance engine, where balanced primary and secondary zones are crucial for efficient mixing and controlled temperature profiles."

          "Step 3: Recall the purpose of the secondary air stream. This air is introduced downstream of the primary zone to complete the combustion of any unburnt fuel and intermediate products, and to begin the process of cooling the hot gases. Typically, this also constitutes about 25-35% of the total airflow.",
          "Step 4: Determine the approximate mass flow rate percentages. While exact figures vary, a common approximation in many combustor designs is that the primary and secondary air mass flow rates are roughly equal, each accounting for approximately 25-30% of the total air.",
          "Step 5: Calculate the ratio. If the mass flow rate of primary air ($\\dot{m}_{primary}$) is approximately equal to the mass flow rate of secondary air ($\\dot{m}_{secondary}$), then their ratio is $\\frac{\\dot{m}_{primary}}{\\dot{m}_{secondary}} \\approx 1:1$."
