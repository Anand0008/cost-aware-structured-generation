The ideal change in velocity ($\\Delta V$) is given by $\\Delta V = g I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_i}{M_f}\\right)$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $I_{sp}$ is the specific impulse, $M_i$ is the initial mass, and $M_f$ is the final (burnout) mass.",
          "Step 3: Define the initial mass ($M_i$) based on the given parameters. The initial mass of the rocket is its total mass, $M_0$. So, $M_i = M_0$.",

This includes the structural mass ($M_S$) and the payload mass ($M_L$). Therefore, $M_f = M_S + M_L$.",
          "Step 5: Relate the final mass to the initial mass and propellant mass. The total initial mass $M_0$ is the sum of the propellant mass ($M_P$), structural mass ($M_S$), and payload mass ($M_L$). Thus, $M_0 = M_P + M_S + M_L$. From this, we can deduce that $M_S + M_L = M_0 - M_P$. Therefore, $M_f = M_0 - M_P$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the expressions for $M_i$ and $M_f$ into the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. This yields the maximum velocity as $g I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_0 - M_P}\\right)$."
