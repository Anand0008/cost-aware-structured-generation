This formula relates the maximum velocity ($V_b$) to the specific impulse ($I_{sp}$), acceleration due to gravity ($g_0$), and the ratio of the initial mass ($M_0$) to the propellant mass ($M_P$). This is the fundamental relationship that governs the maximum achievable velocity of a single-stage rocket in the absence of gravity and atmospheric drag."

          "The question is asking for the maximum velocity that can be attained by a single-stage rocket in the absence of gravity and atmospheric drag.",

          "The formula for the maximum velocity, also known as the burnout velocity ($V_b$), is derived from the rocket equation: $V_b = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_f}\\right)$, where $M_f$ is the final (burnout) mass of the rocket.",
          "For a single-stage rocket, the final mass $M_f$ is the sum of the payload mass ($M_L$) and the structural mass ($M_S$), i.e., $M_f = M_L + M_S$.",
          "Substituting this into the rocket equation, we get: $V_b = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_L + M_S}\\right)$.",
          "However, the question specifically states that the maximum velocity is to be calculated 'in the absence of gravity and atmospheric drag'. This means that the $g_0$ term can be neglected, simplifying the equation to: $V_b = I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_L + M_S}\\right)$.",
          "Finally, since the question provides the total mass ($M_0$) and the propellant mass ($M_P$), we can rewrite the equation as: $V_b = I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_0 - M_P}\\right)$.",
          "This matches the expression given in option D, which is therefore the correct answer."
