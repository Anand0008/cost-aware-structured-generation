The normal vector to the spherical surface at a point (x, y, z) is given by the gradient of the equation of the sphere, which is (x, y, z).\n2. At the point (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3), the normal vector is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n3. The magnitude of this normal vector is √((1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2) = √(3/3) = 1.\n4. The magnitude of the component of vector A normal to the surface is the dot product of the normal vector and vector A, divided by the magnitude of the normal vector.\n5. Since the question does not provide vector A, we can assume it is the position vector from the origin to the point (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3), which is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n6. The dot product of the normal vector and the position vector is (1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2 = 3/3 = 1.\n7. Dividing the dot product by the magnitude of the normal vector (1) gives the final answer of 1, which corresponds to option B."
