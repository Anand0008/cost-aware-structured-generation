        "reasoning": "The Phugoid mode is one of the two primary longitudinal dynamic modes of an aircraft, characterized by a lightly damped, low-frequency oscillation involving significant exchanges between forward speed and altitude/pitch angle, with a nearly constant angle of attack. In aircraft dynamics, the characteristic equation of the linearized equations of motion yields eigenvalues (roots) that represent these modes. These eigenvalues typically appear as complex conjugate pairs for oscillatory modes.\n\nStandard convention in many textbooks (and consistently in the provided RAG context, e.g., Chunks 1, 2, 4) often assigns `$\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$` to the Short Period mode (higher frequency, higher damping) and `$\\lambda_3, \\lambda_4$` to the Phugoid mode (lower frequency, lighter damping). However, the specific labeling of eigenvalues can vary between different problems, textbooks, or instructors.\n\nGiven that the provided answer key states `D. \\lambda_1 \\text{{ and }} \\lambda_2` as the correct option, it implies that in the context of this specific question, `$\\lambda_1$` and `$\\lambda_2$` are designated to represent the Phugoid mode. The critical understanding for students is to identify the *characteristics* of the Phugoid mode (low frequency, low damping) and associate them with the appropriate pair of eigenvalues, regardless of their numerical subscript. If `$\\lambda_1$` and `$\\lambda_2$` are the roots with the smallest magnitude of the imaginary part (lowest frequency) and smallest magnitude of the real part (lightest damping) among the given options, they would represent the Phugoid mode. Without the actual numerical values of the eigenvalues, we adhere to the provided answer key's designation."

          "Step 3: Recall the characteristics of the Short Period mode. It is a highly damped, high-frequency oscillation primarily involving pitching motion (`$\\Theta$`) and angle of attack (`$\\alpha$`), with little change in speed (`$U$`).",
          "Step 4: Relate dynamic modes to eigenvalues. Each oscillatory mode is represented by a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues (roots of the characteristic equation of the aircraft's linearized equations of motion). The magnitude of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue corresponds to the damped natural frequency, and the real part corresponds to the damping.",
          "Step 5: Identify the Phugoid mode based on eigenvalue characteristics. The Phugoid mode corresponds to the pair of eigenvalues with the *lowest frequency* (smallest imaginary part) and *lightest damping* (real part closest to zero) among the oscillatory modes.",
          "Step 6: Address the eigenvalue notation. While standard notation often labels the Short Period mode as `$\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$` and the Phugoid mode as `$\\lambda_3, \\lambda_4$`, the specific indexing can vary. For this question, accepting the provided answer `D. \\lambda_1 \\text{{ and }} \\lambda_2` implies that these specific eigenvalues are designated as the Phugoid pair in this context."
