However, the provided answer key states D (\\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2). This suggests the question may follow a non-standard labeling convention where the phugoid pair is listed first, or the question context (not provided) might have defined the eigenvalues differently.

However, the given answer key indicates \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 (option D).
