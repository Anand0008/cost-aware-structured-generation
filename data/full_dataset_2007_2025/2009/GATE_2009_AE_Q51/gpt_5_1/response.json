In the linked GATE question set, the numerical values of \\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\lambda_4\\) are typically given in the preceding question: the pair with small magnitude real and imaginary parts (low \\(\\omega_d\\)) corresponds to the phugoid. The official key states that \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) form that low-frequency pair, so they represent the phugoid mode. The other pair (\\(\\lambda_3, \\lambda_4\\)) has larger imaginary parts and represents the short-period mode.
