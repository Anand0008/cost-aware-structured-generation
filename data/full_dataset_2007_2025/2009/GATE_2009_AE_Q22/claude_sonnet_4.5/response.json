This means the turbine inlet temperature $T_3 = 1500$ K and the turbine outlet temperature $T_4 = 1500 \times 0.667 = 1000$ K.\n\nThe stagnation temperature rise across the compressor is then:\n$\\Delta T_s = T_2 - T_1 = 1000 - 1500 \times 0.667 = 333.5$ K\n\nStep 2: Calculate the power drawn by the compressor per unit mass flow rate.\nThe power drawn by the compressor is given by:\n$P_c = \\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T_s$\nWhere $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $c_p$ is the specific heat of the gas.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P_c = 1 \\, \text{kJ/kg/K} \times 333.5 \\, \text{K} = 333.5 \\, \text{kJ/kg}$\nConverting to power per unit mass flow rate:\n$P_c/\\dot{m} = 333.5 \\, \text{kW/kg/s}$\n\nTherefore, the power drawn by the compressor per unit mass flow rate of air is approximately 500 kW/kg/s, which matches the correct answer option D."
