        "reasoning": "The given ordinary differential equation is $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + ky = 0$, where $k$ is a real and positive constant.\\n\\n1.  **Form the Characteristic Equation:** For a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, we assume a solution of the form $y = e^{mx}$. Substituting this into the ODE, we replace $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ with $m^2$ and $y$ with $1$. This yields the characteristic equation: $m^2 + k = 0$.\\n\\n2.  **Find the Roots:** Solving for $m$: $m^2 = -k$. Since $k$ is real and positive, $-k$ is a negative real number. Therefore, the roots are $m = \\pm\\sqrt{-k} = \\pm i\\sqrt{k}$.\\n\\n3.  **Analyze the Nature of Roots:** The roots are purely imaginary and distinct complex conjugates, of the form $\\alpha \\pm i\\beta$, where $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\beta = \\sqrt{k}$.\\n\\n4.  **Construct the Complementary Function (General Solution):** For complex conjugate roots $\\alpha \\pm i\\beta$, the general solution (complementary function) is given by $y_c = e^{\\alpha x} (C_1 \\cos(\\beta x) + C_2 \\sin(\\beta x))$.\\n    Substituting $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\beta = \\sqrt{k}$: $y_c = e^{0 \\cdot x} (C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{k} x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{k} x)) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{k} x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{k} x)$.\\n\\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\\n    *   **A. is non-linear:** The ODE is linear because $y$ and its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together. So, A is incorrect.\\n    *   **B. has a characteristic equation with one real and one complex root:** The characteristic equation has two complex conjugate roots ($\\pm i\\sqrt{k}$), not one real and one complex. So, B is incorrect.\\n    *   **C. has a characteristic equation with two real roots:** The roots are complex, not real. Real roots would lead to exponential solutions (as discussed in RAG Chunk 1 & 2). So, C is incorrect.\\n    *   **D. has a complementary function that is simple harmonic:** The complementary function $y_c = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{k} x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{k} x)$ represents a simple harmonic motion (or oscillation) with angular frequency $\\sqrt{k}$. This is consistent with the RAG Chunk 3, which states that for $m^2 + \\mu^2 = 0$, the solution is oscillatory ($C \\cos(\\mu y) + D \\sin(\\mu y)$). So, D is correct."

Specifically, Chunk 3 directly addressed the case of $m^2 + \\mu^2 = 0$ leading to oscillatory solutions, which is the core concept for this question. Chunks 1, 2, 4, and 6 provided general context on solving ODEs and the nature of roots, helping to eliminate incorrect options and reinforce the overall method."
