The interval is $[0, \\pi]$, so $a = 0$ and $b = \\pi$.\n2. We divide the interval into two equal subintervals, so $N = 2$ and $h = \\frac{\\pi - 0}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n3. Applying the composite trapezoidal rule:\n$I_h = \\frac{h}{2} \\left[f(x_0) + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f(x_i) + f(x_N)\\right]$\nwhere $x_0 = 0$, $x_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $x_2 = \\pi$.\n4. Evaluating the function at these points:\n$f(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + 0 + \\sin 0} = 1$\n$f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 1} \\approx 0.4142$\n$f(\\pi) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\pi + 0} \\approx 0.3183$\n5.
