This mode shape is characteristic of a shaft fixed at both ends (or free at both ends). However, the provided answer key is B, which is `$\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}$`. This frequency expression, and its corresponding mode shape `$\\sin(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L})$`, is typically associated with a fixed-free (or free-fixed) torsional shaft. There is a clear inconsistency between the mode shape given in the question and the frequency provided in Option B. For the purpose of this analysis, we acknowledge the answer key as B, but highlight the discrepancy with the question's premise.

          "Step 2: Recall the general solution for the spatial part of the torsional vibration, `$\\phi(x) = A \\cos(\\lambda x) + B \\sin(\\lambda x)$`, where `$\\lambda = \\omega / C$` is the wave number, `$\\omega$` is the natural frequency, and `C` is the torsional wave speed.",
          "Step 3: Compare the given `n`-th mode shape `$\\phi_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x / L)$` with the general spatial solution. For this to be true, the constant `A` must be zero, and the wave number `$\\lambda_n$` must be equal to `$\\frac{n\\pi}{L}$`.",
          "Step 4: Equate `$\\lambda_n$` with `$\\omega_n / C$` to find the natural frequency `$\\omega_n$`: `$\\frac{\\omega_n}{C} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$`, which implies `$\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi C}{L}$`.",
          "Step 5: Substitute the expression for the torsional wave speed `C` for a shaft. The torsional wave speed is given by `C = \\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}`, where `G` is the shear modulus, `J` is the polar moment of inertia of the cross-section, and `I` is the mass moment of inertia per unit length (often `$\\rho J$`, where `$\\rho$` is mass density).",
          "Step 6: Combine the results to get the natural frequency: `$\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}$`. This corresponds to Option A. As noted in the answer validation, the provided correct answer is B, which would correspond to a fixed-free shaft with a different mode shape."
