        "reasoning": "Thin airfoil theory is a fundamental concept in aerodynamics that simplifies the analysis of airfoils by assuming they are infinitesimally thin and operate at small angles of attack in an inviscid, incompressible flow. A key, universal result of this theory is that the lift curve slope, $\\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha}$, is $2\\pi$ per radian. This applies to both symmetric airfoils (where the mean camber line is straight) and cambered airfoils (where the mean camber line is curved). The presence of camber shifts the entire lift curve (introducing a non-zero lift at zero angle of attack, or a negative zero-lift angle of attack), but it does not change the slope of the linear portion of the lift curve. Multiple RAG chunks (Chunk 2, 3, 5) explicitly confirm this universal result. For example, Chunk 5 states: \"According to thin airfoil theory, the theoretical lift slope ($dc_l/d\\alpha$) for any thin airfoil, whether symmetric or cambered, is $2\\pi$ per radian.\""
