        "reasoning": "The operational life of a geostationary (GEO) communications satellite is fundamentally limited by the propellant mass available for station-keeping maneuvers. These maneuvers are essential to counteract orbital perturbations (e.g., gravitational pulls from Sun/Moon, solar radiation pressure, Earth's J2 oblateness effect) that would otherwise cause the satellite to drift from its designated orbital slot. Once this fuel is exhausted, the satellite can no longer perform these corrections and becomes a drifting, uncontrolled object, marking the end of its useful life. While other factors (electronics, meteorites) can cause failure, they are not the primary lifetime determinant for modern GEO satellites. Atmospheric drag is negligible at GEO altitudes (~35,786 km). This is a well-established concept in space mission design, strongly supported by the retrieved knowledge (RAG)."
