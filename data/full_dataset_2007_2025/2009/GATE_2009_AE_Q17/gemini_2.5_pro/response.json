        "reasoning": "Geostationary satellites orbit at a very high altitude (approximately 35,786 km above the Earth's equator). At this altitude, the atmospheric density is extremely low, making atmospheric drag practically negligible (as highlighted in RAG chunks 2, 4, 5). However, these satellites are continuously subjected to various orbital perturbations, such as gravitational forces from the Moon and Sun, solar radiation pressure, and the non-spherical gravitational field of the Earth (specifically the J2 effect). To maintain their precise position within their designated geostationary slot, satellites must perform regular corrective maneuvers known as 'station-keeping' (RAG chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). These maneuvers involve firing on-board thrusters, which consume propellant. The amount of fuel carried for these station-keeping operations is finite and is typically the primary factor that dictates the operational lifespan of the satellite. Once this fuel is depleted, the satellite can no longer maintain its precise position and will begin to drift, effectively ending its useful mission life. While the working life of electronic circuitry (A) and the risk of meteorite impacts (D) are considerations, they are generally secondary to fuel depletion for station-keeping in determining the primary operational limit."

          "Step 2: Identify the forces acting on a satellite in geostationary orbit. Besides Earth's primary gravitational pull, satellites experience 'perturbations' from the Moon's and Sun's gravity, solar radiation pressure, and the Earth's non-uniform gravitational field (J2 effect).",
          "Step 3: Recognize the necessity of 'station-keeping'. To counteract these continuous perturbations and maintain its precise geostationary slot, the satellite must periodically fire its on-board thrusters, a process called station-keeping (RAG chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).",
          "Step 4: Link station-keeping to fuel consumption. These thruster firings require and consume on-board propellant, which is a finite resource.",
          "Step 5: Evaluate the given options in the context of a geostationary satellite's environment and operational needs. Option A (electronic circuitry) is a factor but typically designed for long life. Option B (atmospheric drag) is negligible at geostationary altitude (RAG chunk 5). Option D (meteorite impacts) is a risk but less frequent as a primary life-limiting factor compared to fuel.",
          "Step 6: Conclude that the finite quantity of on-board fuel for station-keeping is the primary factor limiting the operational life of a geostationary communications satellite."
