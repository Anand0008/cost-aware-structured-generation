        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. The life of a geostationary communications satellite is primarily limited by the quantity of on-board fuel available for station-keeping maneuvers. This is because satellites in orbit are constantly affected by various perturbations, such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational effects from the Moon and Sun, which cause the satellite to drift from its desired position. To counteract these perturbations and maintain the satellite's station, periodic thruster firings are required, consuming the limited on-board fuel. Once the fuel is depleted, the satellite can no longer be controlled and its operational life ends. The other options are not the primary limiting factors for satellite lifetime. The working life of electronic circuitry (A) and the number of meteorite impacts (D) are secondary considerations, while orbital decay due to atmospheric drag (B) is not a significant issue for geostationary satellites."

          "The key concept in this question is the primary factor limiting the operational lifetime of a geostationary communications satellite.",
          "Geostationary satellites are placed in an orbit around the Earth's equator at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km, where their orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period.",
          "At this altitude, the satellite experiences minimal atmospheric drag, so orbital decay due to atmospheric effects is not a significant issue (eliminating option B).",
          "The on-board electronic systems are designed to have a long working life, typically exceeding the satellite's operational lifetime (eliminating option A).",
          "While meteorite impacts can potentially damage the satellite structure, modern satellite designs are engineered to withstand a reasonable number of such impacts without compromising the mission (eliminating option D).",
          "The primary limiting factor is the finite amount of on-board fuel available for station-keeping maneuvers (option C).",
          "Station keeping involves periodic thruster firings to counteract natural orbital perturbations, such as gravitational effects from the Sun, Moon, and Earth's oblateness, as well as solar radiation pressure. These perturbations cause the satellite to drift from its desired geostationary position over time.",
          "Without sufficient fuel to perform these station-keeping maneuvers, the satellite will eventually drift out of its assigned orbital slot, rendering it uncontrollable and ending its operational life."
