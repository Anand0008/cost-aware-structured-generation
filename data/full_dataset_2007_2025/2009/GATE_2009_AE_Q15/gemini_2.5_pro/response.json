        "reasoning": "The thrust available from a turbojet engine is directly dependent on the mass flow rate of air ingested by the engine. As altitude increases, the atmospheric air density ($\\rho$) decreases significantly. Since the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_a$) is proportional to air density ($\\dot{m}_a = \\rho A_{inlet} V_{\\infty}$), a decrease in density leads to a decrease in the mass of air processed by the engine per unit time. Consequently, the momentum change imparted to the air by the engine, and thus the thrust produced, decreases. This fundamental principle is consistently supported by the provided retrieved knowledge (Chunks 3, 4, and 5)."

          "Step 1: Understand the primary mechanism of thrust generation in a turbojet engine. A turbojet engine generates thrust by taking in ambient air, compressing it, mixing it with fuel and burning it, and then expelling the hot exhaust gases at a higher velocity than the inlet air. The thrust is primarily due to the change in momentum of the air.",
          "Step 2: Recall the properties of the standard atmosphere. As altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure and temperature decrease, leading to a significant reduction in air density ($\\rho$).",
          "Step 3: Relate air density to the engine's mass flow rate. The mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) entering the engine is proportional to the ambient air density, the engine's inlet area, and the flight velocity ($\\dot{m}_a = \\rho A_{inlet} V_{\\infty}$).",
          "Step 4: Connect the mass flow rate to the thrust produced. The thrust ($F$) generated by a turbojet engine is approximately proportional to the mass flow rate of air and the difference between the exhaust velocity and the inlet velocity ($F \\approx \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$).",
          "Step 5: Conclude the effect of altitude on thrust. Since air density decreases with increasing altitude, the mass flow rate of air through the engine ($\\dot{m}_a$) decreases. This reduction in mass flow rate directly leads to a decrease in the thrust available from the turbojet engine."
