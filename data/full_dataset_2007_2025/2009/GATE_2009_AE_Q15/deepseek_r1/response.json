The thrust equation $F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0) + A_e (p_e - p_0)$ shows that thrust is proportional to mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_a$. Since $\\dot{m}_a = \\rho A V$ and density $\\rho$ decreases with altitude in the standard atmosphere, thrust available decreases. This is supported by RAG chunks 3, 4, and 5, which indicate that absolute thrust decreases with altitude for turbojets."
