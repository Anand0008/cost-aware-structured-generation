Chunk 1 gave a worked example for a similar vector field (F = yz i + zx j + xy k) but over a first octant only. However, the exact vector field A was not explicitly stated in the question text provided. I inferred the likely vector field from the context of Chunk 1 and the answer 0. RAG was helpful but not perfectly complete for the exact question phrasing."
