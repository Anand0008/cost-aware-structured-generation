        "reasoning": "The question asks for the surface integral (flux) of the component of a vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ normal to the surface, taken over a unit sphere. This is represented by the integral $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS$. The surface $S$ is a closed unit sphere, enclosing a volume $V$. According to Gauss's Divergence Theorem, this surface integral can be converted into a volume integral of the divergence of $\\mathbf{A}$ over the enclosed volume $V$: $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS = \\iiint_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) dV$. The vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ is not explicitly provided in the question. In such ambiguous cases, especially when '0' is one of the options, it is a common practice in competitive exams to assume that the vector field possesses a property that leads to one of the given answers. If we assume that $\\mathbf{A}$ is a solenoidal vector field, meaning its divergence is zero (i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$), then the volume integral becomes $\\iiint_V (0) dV = 0$. Therefore, the surface integral evaluates to 0, which matches option C. This interpretation is the most plausible given the options and the nature of GATE questions with incomplete information."

        "step_by_step": [
          "Step 1: Understand the integral type. The phrase \"surface integral (taken over the unit sphere) of the component of A normal to the surface\" refers to the flux of a vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ through a closed surface $S$. This is mathematically expressed as $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector to the surface.",
          "Step 2: Identify the surface. The surface $S$ is a unit sphere, which is a closed surface enclosing a volume $V$.",
          "Step 3: Apply Gauss's Divergence Theorem. For a closed surface $S$ enclosing a volume $V$, Gauss's Divergence Theorem states that the flux of a vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ through $S$ is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of $\\mathbf{A}$ over $V$: $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS = \\iiint_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) dV$.",
          "Step 4: Address the missing vector field. The question does not specify the vector field $\\mathbf{A}$. This is a critical omission. However, in multiple-choice questions where '0' is an option for a flux integral over a closed surface, it often implies a vector field with a specific property.",
          "Step 5: Infer the property of $\\mathbf{A}$. Given that '0' is the correct answer, the most logical inference is that the intended vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ is solenoidal, meaning its divergence is zero ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$). Solenoidal fields represent flows where there are no sources or sinks within the volume.",
          "Step 6: Evaluate the integral. Substituting $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$ into Gauss's Divergence Theorem, we get: $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) dS = \\iiint_V (0) dV = 0$. Thus, the surface integral is 0."
