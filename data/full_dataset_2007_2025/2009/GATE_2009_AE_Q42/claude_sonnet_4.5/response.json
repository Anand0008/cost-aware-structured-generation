        "reasoning": "The question states that the wing root bending moment in steady level flight is M_y = 10 N-m, and the airplane flies at a load factor n = 3.5. To find the maximum bending stress at the root, we can use the bending stress formula: σ = (M_y / I_zz) * y, where I_zz is the moment of inertia of the idealized cross-section about the z-axis (horizontal axis) and y is the vertical distance from the neutral axis. Since the cross-section is symmetric about the z-axis, the neutral axis passes through the centroid, and the stress in the top and bottom booms will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (tension and compression). Plugging in the given values, the maximum stress will occur in the top and bottom booms (y = ±0.025 m) and is calculated as: σ = (10 N-m / I_zz) * 0.025 m = 3.5 × 10^6 N/m^2."
