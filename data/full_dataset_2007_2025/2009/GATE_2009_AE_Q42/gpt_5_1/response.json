When the airplane flies at load factor n = 3.5, the bending moment scales linearly with n: M_y' = n M_y = 3.5 \\times 10 = 35 N-m. For bending about the y-axis, the section behaves like two equal and opposite booms above and below the neutral axis. The second moment of area about the y-axis is I_{yy} = \\sum A_i y_i^2 = 4 \\times (1\\times10^{-4}) \\times (0.025)^2 = 2.5\\times10^{-7} m^4.
