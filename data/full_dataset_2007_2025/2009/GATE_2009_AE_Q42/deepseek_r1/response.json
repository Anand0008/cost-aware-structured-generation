Possibly, some solvers forget to square the distance in moment of inertia or misinterpret the neutral axis location, leading to B.

Horizontal distance between booms is 0.5 m, suggesting y-coordinates ±0.25 m. Vertical offsets from the chord line (neutral axis) are ±0.025 m, so z-coordinates relative to centroid are z₁ = +0.025 m, z₂ = -0.025 m.",
          "Step 2: Compute moment of inertia about y-axis (I_yy). For point areas, I_yy = Σ A_i z_i² = (1e-4)×(0.025²) + (1e-4)×(0.025²) = 1.25 × 10⁻⁷ m⁴.",
          "Step 3: Determine bending moment. In steady level flight, M_y = 10 N·m. At load factor n = 3.5, the design bending moment is M = n × M_y = 3.5 × 10 = 35 N·m.",
          "Step 4: Apply simple bending formula for symmetric bending about y-axis (since booms are collinear, neutral axis is y-axis). Bending stress σ = (M / I_yy) × z. Maximum stress occurs at boom with largest |z| = 0.025 m.",
