        "reasoning": "The problem asks for the maximum bending stress at the wing root. The wing root cross-section is idealized into four booms, each with an area of $1 \\text{ cm}^2$. The booms are located at vertical distances of $\\pm 0.025 \\text{ m}$ from the chord line (which serves as the neutral axis for bending about the horizontal axis). The steady level flight bending moment is $M_{y,SLF} = 10 \\text{ N-m}$, and the airplane flies at a load factor $n = 3.5$. \\n\\n**Step 1: Convert units.**\\nBoom area $A_b = 1 \\text{ cm}^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2$.\\nVertical distance from neutral axis $x = 0.025 \\text{ m}$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Calculate the actual bending moment.**\\nThe bending moment increases with the load factor. \\n$M_{actual} = n \\times M_{y,SLF} = 3.5 \\times 10 \\text{ N-m} = 35 \\text{ N-m}$.\\n\\n**Step 3: Calculate the moment of inertia ($I_{yy}$) about the neutral axis.**\\nSince the bending moment is given as $M_y$ and the booms are vertically displaced from the 'y' axis (chord line in the diagram), we assume bending about the horizontal y-axis (the chord line). The moment of inertia for an idealized section with discrete booms is given by $I_{yy} = \\sum A_i x_i^2$, where $x_i$ is the vertical distance of each boom from the neutral axis.\\nThere are two booms at $x = +0.025 \\text{ m}$ and two booms at $x = -0.025 \\text{ m}$.\\n$I_{yy} = 2 \\times (A_b \\times (0.025)^2) + 2 \\times (A_b \\times (-0.025)^2)$ \\n$I_{yy} = 4 \\times A_b \\times (0.025)^2$ \\n$I_{yy} = 4 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2) \\times (0.025 \\text{ m})^2$ \\n$I_{yy} = 4 \\times 10^{-4} \\times (6.25 \\times 10^{-4}) \\text{ m}^4$ \\n$I_{yy} = 25 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}^4 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}^4$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Calculate the maximum bending stress.**\\nThe bending stress formula for a symmetric section subjected to bending about one principal axis is $\\sigma = \\frac{M}{I} x$, where $x$ is the distance from the neutral axis. The maximum stress occurs at the points furthest from the neutral axis, which are the booms at $x_{max} = 0.025 \\text{ m}$.\\n$\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M_{actual}}{I_{yy}} x_{max}$ \\n$\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{35 \\text{ N-m}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}^4} \\times 0.025 \\text{ m}$ \\n$\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{0.875}{2.5 \\times 10^{-7}} \\text{ N/m}^2$ \\n$\\sigma_{max} = 0.35 \\times 10^7 \\text{ N/m}^2 = 3.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2$.\\n\\nThis result matches option B."

This significantly aided in confirming the correct approach and formulas."
