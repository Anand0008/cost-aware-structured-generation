This means an increase in angle of attack ($\\alpha$) generates a nose-up (diverging) pitching moment, which tends to further increase the angle of attack, amplifying the disturbance.\n*   If `$\\frac{dC_m}{d\\alpha} = 0$`, the component/aircraft is neutrally stable.\n\nThe question provides the pitching moment coefficient contribution from the horizontal tail as: `Cmtail = 0.2 – 0.0215 \\alpha`.\n\nTo determine its stability contribution, we need to find the derivative of `Cmtail` with respect to `$\\alpha$`:\n`$\\frac{dC_{m_{tail}}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} (0.2 - 0.0215 \\alpha)$`\n`$\\frac{dC_{m_{tail}}}{d\\alpha} = -0.0215$`\n\nSince `$\\frac{dC_{m_{tail}}}{d\\alpha} = -0.0215$`, which is a negative value, the contribution of the horizontal tail to the aircraft's longitudinal stability is **stabilizing**.
