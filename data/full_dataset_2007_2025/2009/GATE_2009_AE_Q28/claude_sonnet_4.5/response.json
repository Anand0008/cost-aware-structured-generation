        "reasoning": "The given equation for the contribution of the horizontal tail to the pitching moment coefficient about the center of gravity (CmCG) is Cmtail = 0.2 - 0.0215α. The negative sign on the second term indicates that the tail contribution is stabilizing, as the pitching moment decreases with increasing angle of attack (α). This is because the tail is located behind the aircraft's center of gravity, creating a stabilizing nose-down moment as the angle of attack increases. Therefore, the correct answer is A, the contribution of the horizontal tail to the aircraft's longitudinal stability is stabilizing."

          "Analyze the equation: The negative sign on the second term (-0.0215α) indicates that the tail contribution is decreasing as the angle of attack increases. This means that the tail is generating a stabilizing, nose-down moment.",
          "Recall the role of the horizontal tail in aircraft longitudinal stability: The tail is typically located behind the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). As the angle of attack increases, the increased lift on the tail creates a nose-down moment, which counteracts the destabilizing tendency of the wing and fuselage.",
          "Conclude that the tail contribution is stabilizing: Since the tail's contribution to the pitching moment decreases with increasing angle of attack (i.e., dCmtail/dα is negative), the horizontal tail is providing a stabilizing effect to the overall aircraft longitudinal stability."
