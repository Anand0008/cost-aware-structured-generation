        "reasoning": "The problem involves a 2-celled thin-walled tube subjected to a torque, and asks for the torque balance equation using the Bredt-Batho formula. The total torque applied to a multi-cell section is the sum of the torques carried by each individual cell.\n\n1.  **Identify Cell Dimensions and Areas:**\n    From the image, both Cell 1 (top) and Cell 2 (bottom) are square with side dimensions of 50 mm.\n    *   Area of Cell 1, $A_1 = (50 \\text{ mm}) \\times (50 \\text{ mm}) = 2500 \\text{ mm}^2$.\n    *   Area of Cell 2, $A_2 = (50 \\text{ mm}) \\times (50 \\text{ mm}) = 2500 \\text{ mm}^2$.\n\n2.  **Convert Applied Torque to Consistent Units:**\n    The applied torque is given as $T = 10 \\text{ N-m}$. To be consistent with areas in $\\text{mm}^2$, convert the torque to N-mm:\n    *   $T = 10 \\text{ N-m} \\times (1000 \\text{ mm/m}) = 10000 \\text{ N-mm}$.\n\n3.  **Apply Bredt-Batho Formula for each cell:**\n    The Bredt-Batho formula for the torque carried by a single thin-walled closed cell is $T_i = 2 A_i q_i$, where $A_i$ is the enclosed area and $q_i$ is the shear flow in cell $i$.\n    *   Torque carried by Cell 1: $T_1 = 2 A_1 q_1$\n    *   Torque carried by Cell 2: $T_2 = 2 A_2 q_2$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Total Torque Balance Equation:**\n    The image shows both shear flows, $q_1$ and $q_2$, circulating in the clockwise direction. Assuming the applied torque $T$ is also clockwise (or establishing a consistent sign convention where clockwise is positive), the total torque is the sum of the torques from each cell:\n    *   $T = T_1 + T_2$\n    *   $T = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2$\n\n5.  **Substitute Values into the Equation:**\n    *   $10000 \\text{ N-mm} = 2 \\times (2500 \\text{ mm}^2) \\times q_1 + 2 \\times (2500 \\text{ mm}^2) \\times q_2$\n    *   $10000 = 5000 q_1 + 5000 q_2$\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    Divide the entire equation by 5000:\n    *   $2 = q_1 + q_2$\n\n7.  **Convert Units to Match Options:**\n    The options are given in N/m. The current equation implies $q_1$ and $q_2$ are in N/mm (since $T$ is N-mm and $A$ is $\\text{mm}^2$, $q = T/(2A)$ would be N-mm/mm$^2$ = N/mm). To convert N/mm to N/m, multiply by 1000:\n    *   $q_1 + q_2 = 2 \\text{ N/mm} = 2 \\times 1000 \\text{ N/m} = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$.\n\nThis derived equation, $q_1 + q_2 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$, matches Option C."

          "Step 2: Calculate the enclosed area for each cell. Since both cells are identical squares, $A_1 = A_2 = (50 \\text{ mm})^2 = 2500 \\text{ mm}^2$.",
          "Step 3: Convert the applied torque to a consistent unit system, typically N-mm, to match the millimeter dimensions of the cells. $T = 10 \\text{ N-m} = 10 \\times 1000 \\text{ N-mm} = 10000 \\text{ N-mm}$.",
          "Step 4: Recall the Bredt-Batho formula for the torque carried by a single thin-walled closed cell: $T_i = 2 A_i q_i$.",
          "Step 5: Formulate the total torque balance equation for the multi-cell section. Since both shear flows $q_1$ and $q_2$ are shown in the same (clockwise) direction, their contributions to the total torque add up. The total applied torque $T$ is the sum of the torques from Cell 1 and Cell 2: $T = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2$.",
          "Step 6: Substitute the calculated areas and the total applied torque into the torque balance equation: $10000 = 2 \\times (2500) \\times q_1 + 2 \\times (2500) \\times q_2$.",
          "Step 7: Simplify the equation: $10000 = 5000 q_1 + 5000 q_2$. Divide the entire equation by 5000 to get $2 = q_1 + q_2$.",
          "Step 8: Convert the units of the resulting equation to match the options provided (N/m). Since the calculation used N-mm and $\\text{mm}^2$, the shear flow $q$ is in N/mm. To convert $2 \\text{ N/mm}$ to N/m, multiply by 1000: $2 \\times 1000 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$.",
          "Step 9: The final torque balance equation is $q_1 + q_2 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$, which corresponds to Option C."
