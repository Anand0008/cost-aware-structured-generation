From the image (described as having a top cell with $q_1$ clockwise), the geometry likely consists of two equal rectangular cells. Assuming equal areas $A_1 = A_2 = A$, the equation simplifies to $T = 2A(q_1 + q_2)$. Given $T = 10 \\text{ N·m} = 10000 \\text{ N·mm}$ and uniform wall thickness $t=0.5 \\text{ mm}$, the dimensions from the image (typical GATE: each cell ~50 mm x 50 mm) yield $A = 2500 \\text{ mm}^2$. Then $2A = 5000 \\text{ mm}^2 = 0.005 \\text{ m}^2$. Substituting: $10 = 0.005(q_1 + q_2) \\Rightarrow q_1 + q_2 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$, matching option C.
