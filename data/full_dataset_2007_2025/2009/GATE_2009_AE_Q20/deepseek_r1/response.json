For an open thin-walled section composed of two straight legs meeting at a corner (like an L-angle or a cruciform), the shear centre lies at the intersection of the centre-lines of the legs. Based on the image description (points A, B, D forming an L-shape with B as the junction) and the retrieved knowledge (Chunk 2: 'For both, the shear center is located at the intersection of the centerlines of the thin rectangular elements'), the shear centre is at the junction point B.
