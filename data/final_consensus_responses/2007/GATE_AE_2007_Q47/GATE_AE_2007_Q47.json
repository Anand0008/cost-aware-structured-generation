      "reasoning": "For an impulse turbine with identical stages, the rotor blades are typically identical in shape. The 'absolute inlet blade angle' given (37°) refers to the geometric angle of the rotor blade at inlet measured from the turbine axis. Since the stages are identical, the rotor blade's exit geometric angle is the same as its inlet geometric angle. Therefore, the absolute exit blade angle is also 37°. This matches option B. The stator exit angle (70°) is a distractor; the key is recognizing that blade angles, not flow angles, are asked for and that identical stages imply identical blade geometry."

        "Understand the problem context: The turbine is an impulse type with 'identical stages'. Angles are measured 'with the axis of the turbine' (axial direction). Identify the given angles: The absolute gas inlet angle to the rotor (from the stator) is 70° ($\\alpha_{2,axial}$), and the rotor blade inlet angle (relative inlet angle for shockless entry) is 37° ($\\beta_{2,axial}$).",
        "Apply the principle of identical stages and impulse turbine characteristics. For an impulse turbine with identical stages, the rotor blades are typically symmetrical. This implies that the relative inlet blade angle is equal to the relative outlet blade angle for shockless entry and smooth exit.",
        "Therefore, the relative exit angle of the gas from the rotor blades ($\\beta_{3,axial}$) is equal to the relative inlet blade angle ($\\beta_{2,axial}$). So, $\\beta_{3,axial} = 37^\\circ$.",
        "Recognize the implied design condition for impulse turbines in such problems: For an impulse turbine with symmetrical blades and identical stages, it is often assumed that the absolute exit angle of the gas from the rotor ($\\alpha_{3,axial}$) is equal to the relative exit angle of the gas from the rotor ($\\beta_{3,axial}$). This simplifies the problem and is a common convention in GATE-style questions.",
        "Applying this design condition, $\\alpha_{3,axial} = \\beta_{3,axial}$. Since $\\beta_{3,axial} = 37^\\circ$, the absolute exit blade angle with the axis of the turbine at the mean blade height of the rotor blades is $\\alpha_{3,axial} = 37^\\circ$."
