      "reasoning": "The question asks for the boundary conditions of a rod fixed at the root (x=0) and free at the tip (x=l) for longitudinal vibration.\n\n1.  **Fixed end at x=0 (root):** A fixed end implies that there is no displacement at that point. Therefore, the displacement `u` at `x=0` must be zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as `u(x=0, t) = 0`.\n2.  **Free end at x=l (tip):** A free end implies that there are no external forces acting on that end. In longitudinal vibration, the internal axial force (and thus stress) must be zero. The axial stress `$\\sigma$` in a rod is related to the displacement `u` by `$\\sigma = E (\\partial u / \\partial x)$`, where `E` is Young's modulus. If `$\\sigma = 0$`, then `$\\partial u / \\partial x$` must be zero at `x=l`. Mathematically, this is expressed as `$\\partial u / \\partial x (x=l, t) = 0$`.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the correct boundary conditions are `u(x=0)=0` and `$\\partial u / \\partial x(x=l)=0$`. This matches option A. Options B, C, and D incorrectly assign zero displacement at the free end or zero slope at the fixed end, which are not the correct physical conditions for a fixed-free configuration."

        "description": "Boundary conditions can be derived using variational principles (e.g., Hamilton's Principle) by applying them to the Lagrangian of the system or minimizing the action integral, considering virtual work at the boundaries. This approach yields 'natural boundary conditions' and is more general for complex systems where direct force/displacement conditions are not obvious.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More rigorous and general, can handle complex boundary conditions (e.g., elastic supports, attached masses). Cons: More mathematically involved, requires a deeper understanding of calculus of variations.",
        "when_to_use": "For advanced analysis, research, or when dealing with non-standard or coupled boundary conditions."

      "Mechanics of Materials": "Fundamental concepts of stress, strain, Young's modulus, and their relationship to deformation are prerequisites. Specifically, the stress-strain relation ($\\sigma = E\\epsilon$) and definition of strain ($\\epsilon = du/dx$) are fundamental for understanding the stress-displacement relation used in boundary conditions.",
      "Differential Equations": "Solving the wave equation for longitudinal vibration involves applying these boundary conditions to determine the constants of integration and the characteristic equation for natural frequencies.",
      "Structural Dynamics": "This question is a foundational concept within structural dynamics, specifically for continuous systems, and is extended to transverse vibration of beams and torsional vibration of shafts.",
      "Partial Differential Equations": "The wave equation is a PDE; boundary conditions are necessary to obtain a unique solution."
