      "reasoning": "The total pressure (or stagnation pressure) is defined as the pressure a fluid would attain if it were brought to a complete stop through an isentropic process. An isentropic process is a reversible adiabatic process, meaning there is no heat transfer and no losses due to friction or other irreversibilities. This ideal process ensures that the maximum possible pressure is achieved by converting all kinetic energy into internal energy and flow work. This definition distinguishes it from stagnation temperature, which only requires an adiabatic process."

        "Identify the key concept: Total pressure (stagnation pressure). Understand that for incompressible flow, it's the sum of static and dynamic pressure, but for compressible flow, it's defined via an isentropic process.",
        "Recall that total pressure (stagnation pressure) is defined as the pressure achieved when a fluid flow is brought to a complete halt (zero velocity) from its current state.",
        "Differentiate between stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure. Stagnation temperature requires an adiabatic process, while stagnation pressure requires an isentropic process (adiabatic and reversible, meaning no losses).",
        "An adiabatic process involves no heat transfer, which is sufficient for stagnation temperature. However, for total pressure, the process must also be reversible (no losses), making it isentropic. Irreversible processes would lead to a drop in total pressure, so the ideal definition assumes an isentropic process.",
        "An isentropic process is a special type of adiabatic process that is also reversible, meaning there are no frictional losses or other irreversibilities. Therefore, adiabatic alone is insufficient, and isothermal or isobaric processes are not relevant for defining total pressure.",
        "For total pressure to represent the maximum possible pressure potential of the flow, the process of bringing the fluid to rest must be ideal, i.e., without any losses. This ideal, lossless process is an isentropic one.",
        "Therefore, total pressure is correctly defined as the pressure when the flow is brought to rest isentropically."
