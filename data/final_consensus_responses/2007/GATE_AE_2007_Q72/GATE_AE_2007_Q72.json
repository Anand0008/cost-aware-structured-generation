The problem states that $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = -0.1$. We know that $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = -SM$. Given $\\bar{X}_{CG} = 0.3$ and $\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = -0.1$, we can find the static margin at this specific CG location:\n$SM = -\\left(\\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}\\right) = -(-0.1) = 0.1$.\n\nNow, using the static margin definition, we can determine the neutral point location ($\\bar{X}_{N0}$):\n$0.1 = \\bar{X}_{N0} - 0.3$\n$\\bar{X}_{N0} = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4$\nSo, the neutral point is at $0.4 \\bar{c}$.\n\nThe designer's requirement is that the longitudinal static stability margin (SM) must be within 5% to 15% of the mean aerodynamic chord, which means $0.05 \\le SM \\le 0.15$.\n\nThe 'most aft location of the airplane center of gravity' corresponds to the *minimum* acceptable static margin, as moving the CG further aft reduces the static margin. Therefore, we use $SM_{min} = 0.05$.\n\nUsing the static margin definition again with $SM_{min}$ and the determined $\\bar{X}_{N0}$ to calculate the most aft CG location ($\\bar{X}_{CG,max\\_aft}$):\n$SM_{min} = \\bar{X}_{N0} - \\bar{X}_{CG,max\\_aft}$\n$0.05 = 0.4 - \\bar{X}_{CG,max\\_aft}$\n$\\bar{X}_{CG,max\\_aft} = 0.4 - 0.05 = 0.35$\n\nThus, the most aft CG location permitted is $0.35 \\bar{c}$."
