      "reasoning": "Euler's method (also called explicit Euler or forward Euler) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Given an ODE of the form $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ and a constant step size $\\Delta t$, the Euler iteration formula for updating the solution from time step $k$ to $k+1$ is derived by approximating the derivative with a forward difference. The formula is $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)$. This directly matches option D, which is the correct answer."

        "Understand the problem: The question asks for the Euler iteration formula for a first-order nonlinear differential equation of the form $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ with a constant step size $\\Delta t$. This is a direct recall question about a standard numerical method.",
        "Recall the fundamental principle of Euler's method. It approximates the solution by assuming the slope $f(x)$ is constant over a small time interval $\\Delta t$. The method is used to approximate the solution at the next time step $x_{{k+1}}$ given the current solution $x_k$ and the step size $\\Delta t$.",
        "Derive the formula by approximating the derivative $\\dot{x}$ using a forward difference scheme: $\\dot{x} \\approx \\frac{x_{{k+1}} - x_k}{\\Delta t}$. Equating this approximation with the given differential equation $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, we get $\\frac{x_{{k+1}} - x_k}{\\Delta t} = f(x_k)$.",
        "Rearrange the equation from Step 3 to solve for $x_{k+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $\\Delta t$ and adding $x_k$ to both sides yields the Euler iteration formula: $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)$.",
        "Compare the derived formula with the given options. The formula $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Delta t \\times f(x_k)$ perfectly matches option D."
