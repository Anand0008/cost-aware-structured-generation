        "Step 1: Identify the system as a harmonically forced Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper system. Recall the steady-state amplitude formula: $X = X_{st} \\times M$, where $X_{st} = F_0/k$ is the static deflection and $M$ is the magnification factor. The magnification factor is given by $M = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - r^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta r)^2)}}$, where $r = \\omega / \\omega_n$ is the frequency ratio, $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$ is the natural frequency, and $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio.",
        "Step 2: Apply the condition at resonance. At resonance, the excitation frequency $\\omega$ equals the natural frequency $\\omega_n$, so the frequency ratio $r = 1$. The magnification factor simplifies to $M_r = \\frac{1}{2\\zeta}$. Given that the amplitude at resonance $X_{res} = 1$ cm, we have $1 = X_{st} \\times \\frac{1}{2\\zeta}$, which implies $X_{st} = 2\\zeta$ (Equation 1).",
        "Step 3: Apply the condition at half the resonant frequency. Here, $\\omega = \\omega_n / 2$, so the frequency ratio $r = 0.5$. The magnification factor becomes $M_{0.5r} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - (0.5)^2)^2 + (2 \\zeta \\times 0.5)^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((1 - 0.25)^2 + \\zeta^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{((0.75)^2 + \\zeta^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)}}$. Given that the amplitude $X_{0.5r} = 0.5$ cm, we have $0.5 = X_{st} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)}}$ (Equation 2).",
        "Step 4: Substitute Equation 1 ($X_{st} = 2\\zeta$) into Equation 2: $0.5 = (2\\zeta) \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)}}$.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the equation: $0.5 \\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)} = 2 \\zeta$. Multiply both sides by 2: $\\sqrt{(0.5625 + \\zeta^2)} = 4 \\zeta$.",
        "Step 6: Square both sides of the equation: $(0.5625 + \\zeta^2) = (4 \\zeta)^2 \\implies 0.5625 + \\zeta^2 = 16 \\zeta^2$.",
        "Step 7: Isolate $\\zeta^2$: $0.5625 = 16 \\zeta^2 - \\zeta^2 \\implies 0.5625 = 15 \\zeta^2$. Therefore, $\\zeta^2 = \\frac{0.5625}{15} = 0.0375$.",
        "Step 8: Calculate $\\zeta$: $\\zeta = \\sqrt{0.0375} \\approx 0.193649$. Comparing this value with the given options, the closest value is 0.1936."
