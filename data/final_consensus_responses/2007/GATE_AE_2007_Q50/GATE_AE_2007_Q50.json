      "reasoning": "The problem states that an athlete starts with an initial speed V₀, and subsequently, his speed decreases by an amount proportional to the distance he has already covered. Let V(t) be the speed at time t, and x(t) be the distance covered at time t. The initial condition is x(0) = 0.\n\nThe phrase 'his speed decreases by an amount that is proportional to the distance that he has already covered' implies that the current speed V is equal to the initial speed V₀ minus a term proportional to the distance x. Mathematically, this can be written as:\nV = V₀ - kx\nwhere k is a positive proportionality constant.\n\nWe also know that speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time:\nV = dx/dt\n\nEquating the two expressions for V:\ndx/dt = V₀ - kx\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using the method of separation of variables:\ndx/(V₀ - kx) = dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n∫ dx/(V₀ - kx) = ∫ dt\n\nTo integrate the left side, let u = V₀ - kx. Then du = -k dx, which means dx = -(1/k) du.\n∫ (-1/k du)/u = ∫ dt\n-(1/k) ∫ (1/u) du = ∫ dt\n-(1/k) ln|u| = t + C₁\n\nSubstitute u = V₀ - kx back:\n-(1/k) ln|V₀ - kx| = t + C₁\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: at t=0, x=0.\n-(1/k) ln|V₀ - k(0)| = 0 + C₁\nC₁ = -(1/k) ln(V₀)\n\nSubstitute C₁ back into the equation:\n-(1/k) ln|V₀ - kx| = t - (1/k) ln(V₀)\n\nMultiply by -k:\nln|V₀ - kx| = -kt + ln(V₀)\n\nRearrange the logarithmic terms:\nln|V₀ - kx| - ln(V₀) = -kt\nln((V₀ - kx)/V₀) = -kt\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n(V₀ - kx)/V₀ = e^(-kt)\n\nSince the athlete starts with speed V₀ and the speed decreases, V₀ - kx will remain positive as long as the athlete is moving forward (i.e., V > 0). Thus, we can remove the absolute value sign.\nV₀ - kx = V₀ e^(-kt)\n\nNow, solve for x(t):\nkx = V₀ - V₀ e^(-kt)\nx(t) = (V₀/k) (1 - e^(-kt))\n\nThis equation shows that the distance covered x(t) is an exponential function of time. As t → ∞, e^(-kt) → 0, and x(t) approaches a limiting distance of V₀/k. Therefore, the distance covered will be exponential in time."

        "Step 1: Define variables. Let $x(t)$ be the distance covered at time $t$, and $v(t) = dx/dt$ be the speed. The initial speed is $V_0$, and the initial distance is $x(0)=0$.",
        "Step 2: Translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation. The speed decreases by an amount proportional to the distance covered, so the instantaneous speed is $v(t) = V_0 - \\alpha x(t)$, where $\\alpha > 0$ is a proportionality constant.",
        "Step 3: Substitute $v = dx/dt$ into the speed equation to form the differential equation: $dx/dt = V_0 - \\alpha x$.",
        "Step 4: Rearrange the differential equation into the standard linear first-order ODE form: $dx/dt + \\alpha x = V_0$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the first-order linear ODE using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is $\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\alpha dt} = e^{\\alpha t}$. Multiply the ODE by the integrating factor: $e^{\\alpha t} dx/dt + \\alpha e^{\\alpha t} x = V_0 e^{\\alpha t}$.",
        "Step 6: Recognize the left side of the equation as the derivative of a product: $\\frac{d}{dt} (x e^{\\alpha t}) = V_0 e^{\\alpha t}$.",
        "Step 7: Integrate both sides with respect to $t$: $x e^{\\alpha t} = \\int V_0 e^{\\alpha t} dt = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} e^{\\alpha t} + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.",
        "Step 8: Divide by $e^{\\alpha t}$ to solve for $x(t)$: $x(t) = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} + C e^{-\\alpha t}$.",
        "Step 9: Apply the initial condition $x(0) = 0$ (distance covered at $t=0$ is zero): $0 = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} + C e^{-\\alpha \\cdot 0} \\implies 0 = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{V_0}{\\alpha}$.",
        "Step 10: Substitute the value of $C$ back into the equation for $x(t)$: $x(t) = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} - \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} e^{-\\alpha t} = \\frac{V_0}{\\alpha} (1 - e^{-\\alpha t})$. This shows that the distance covered is an exponential function of time."
