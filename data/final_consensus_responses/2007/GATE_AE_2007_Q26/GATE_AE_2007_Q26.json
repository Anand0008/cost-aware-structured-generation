For two pipes carrying water at the same volume flow rate ($Q$), the fluid properties ($\\rho$ and $\\mu$) are constant (assuming constant temperature). The volume flow rate is also given by $Q = A V$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. For a circular pipe, $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$. \n\nFrom the continuity equation, $V = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $V$ into the Reynolds number formula:\n$\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}\\right) D}{\\mu} = \\frac{4 \\rho Q}{\\pi \\mu D}$.\n\nSince $\\rho$, $Q$, $\\pi$, and $\\mu$ are constant for both pipes, the Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the pipe diameter ($D$).

        "Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal. We have two pipes with different diameters ($D_1 \\neq D_2$) carrying the same fluid (water) at the same volume flow rate ($Q_1 = Q_2$). We need to compare their Reynolds numbers.",
        "Step 2: Recall the definition of Reynolds number for pipe flow: Re = (\\rho * V * D) / \\mu, where \\rho is density, V is average velocity, D is pipe diameter, and \\mu is dynamic viscosity.",
        "Step 3: Relate the flow velocity ($V$) to the given volume flow rate ($Q$) and pipe cross-sectional area ($A$) using the continuity equation: $Q = A V$, so $V = Q/A$.",
        "Step 4: Express the cross-sectional area ($A$) for a circular pipe in terms of its diameter ($D$): $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$. Therefore, $V = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the expression for $V$ into the Reynolds number formula: $\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\frac{4Q}{\\pi D^2}\\right) D}{\\mu}$.",
        "Step 6: Simplify the expression for the Reynolds number: $\\text{Re} = \\frac{4 \\rho Q}{\\pi \\mu D}$.",
        "Step 7: Analyze the relationship. Since the fluid (water), volume flow rate ($Q$), density ($\\rho$), and dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$) are constant for both pipes, the Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the pipe diameter ($D$), i.e., $\\text{Re} \\propto \\frac{1}{D}$. Thus, a narrower pipe (smaller $D$) will have a larger Reynolds number."
