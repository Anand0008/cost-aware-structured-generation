      "reasoning": "The primary purpose of a fuel injection system in a combustor (such as in gas turbines or rocket engines) is atomization. This process involves converting bulk liquid fuel into a fine mist of tiny droplets. Atomization is crucial for efficient and complete combustion because it significantly increases the fuel's surface area, thereby facilitating rapid vaporization and thorough mixing with the oxidizer (air). Options A, B, and C are incorrect: accelerating flow is not its primary role, injectors typically cause pressure drops rather than increasing stagnation pressure, and ignition is performed by a separate igniter system, not the fuel injector itself."
