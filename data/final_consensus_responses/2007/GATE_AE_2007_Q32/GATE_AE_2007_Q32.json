First, calculate the orbital radius $r = R_E + h$. Then, determine the orbital velocity $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{g_0 R_E^2}{r}}$. The magnitude of the required velocity change is given by $\\Delta V = 2V \\sin(\\frac{\\Delta i}{2})$, where $\\Delta i$ is the change in inclination (10.5 degrees). The direction of this $\\Delta V$ relative to the initial velocity vector is $90^{\\circ} + \\frac{\\Delta i}{2}$. Performing these calculations yields $\\Delta V \\approx 561$ m/s and an angle of $95.25^{\\circ}$ to the initial direction, which matches option B."

Calculate the orbital radius ($r$) from the Earth's center as $r = R_E + h$.",
        "Step 1: Compute the orbital radius from the Earth's center: r = R_e + h = 6.37e6 m + 35.9e6 m = 42.27e6 m.",

        "industry_example": "A satellite launched from Cape Canaveral (latitude 28.5°N) initially goes into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) with inclination ~28.5°. To become geostationary, it must perform a plane change to 0° inclination at apogee, often combined with circularization. The required delta-V can be substantial (hundreds of m/s).",
        "why_it_matters": "Minimizing plane change delta-V saves propellant, extending satellite lifetime or allowing more payload. This is why launches for GEO satellites are often from near-equatorial sites like Kourou (French Guiana)."

If you remember the formulas for circular orbital velocity and the delta-V for inclination change, it's a straightforward plug-and-chug. If not, it might be time-consuming and should be skipped.

      "guessing_heuristic": "The magnitude 561 m/s is plausible as a few percent of orbital speed. For the angle, recall that delta-V is usually applied somewhat opposite to velocity to reduce inclination, so the angle should be >90°. Specifically, 90° + Δi/2 is a common result for plane changes. Eliminate options with wrong order of magnitude or inconsistent angles.",
      "time_management": "Budget 3-4 minutes. Perform quick calculations: r = 6.37e6+35.9e6=42.27e6, V ≈ √(9.81*6.37e6^2/42.27e6) ≈ 3070 m/s. Then ΔV=2*3070*sin(5.25°) ≈ 562 m/s. Angle=90+5.25=95.25. Double-check calculator inputs and unit consistency."
