      "reasoning": "The von Mises yield criterion, also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion, for a general 3D stress state in terms of principal stresses (σ₁, σ₂, σ₃) is given by the equivalent stress: σ_v = √(½ [ (σ₁ - σ₂)² + (σ₂ - σ₃)² + (σ₃ - σ₁)² ]). Yielding occurs when σ_v = σ_Y, where σ_Y is the uniaxial tensile yield strength. For a plane stress problem, the third principal stress is zero, i.e., σ₃ = 0. Substituting σ₃ = 0 into the equation for σ_v²:\nσ_v² = ½ [ (σ₁ - σ₂)² + (σ₂ - 0)² + (0 - σ₁)² ]\nσ_v² = ½ [ (σ₁² - 2σ₁σ₂ + σ₂²) + σ₂² + σ₁² ]\nσ_v² = ½ [ 2σ₁² - 2σ₁σ₂ + 2σ₂² ]\nσ_v² = σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂²\nTherefore, the yield condition (when σ_v = σ_Y) is σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂² = σ_Y². For the material to remain elastic or be at the point of yielding, the equivalent stress must be less than or equal to the yield stress. Hence, the criterion is: σ₁² - σ₁σ₂ + σ₂² ≤ σ_Y². This matches option A. Options B, C, and D do not correctly represent the von Mises yield criterion for a plane stress state; for instance, option B resembles the Tresca criterion in some forms, and C and D are incomplete."

        "Step 3: Apply the plane stress condition. In plane stress, the stress components perpendicular to the plane are zero. This means the third principal stress, $\\sigma_3$, is zero.",

        "Step 6: State the yield condition. Yielding occurs when $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_Y$.

        "name": "Tresca (Maximum Shear Stress) Yield Criterion",
        "description": "The Tresca criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches half the uniaxial yield strength of the material. This is an alternative to the Von Mises criterion, which is based on the distortion energy theory.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Simpler to apply, more conservative (predicts yielding earlier). Cons: Less accurate for ductile materials than Von Mises, especially for complex stress states, and does not account for combined effects of normal and shear stresses as comprehensively.",
        "when_to_use": "Often used for preliminary design, when a more conservative estimate of yielding is desired (e.g., in safety-critical applications), or for brittle materials in some contexts."
