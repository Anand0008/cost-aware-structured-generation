The derivative of this function is $f'(x) = 3x^2$. The Newton-Raphson iteration formula is given by $x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$. Substituting $f(x_k)$ and $f'(x_k)$ into the formula: $x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{x_k^3 - c}{3x_k^2}$. To simplify, find a common denominator: $x_{k+1} = \\frac{x_k \\cdot (3x_k^2) - (x_k^3 - c)}{3x_k^2} = \\frac{3x_k^3 - x_k^3 + c}{3x_k^2} = \\frac{2x_k^3 + c}{3x_k^2}$. This matches option C. Options A and B incorrectly include $\\sqrt[3]{c}$ (the very root we seek). Option D has an incorrect numerator coefficient (1 instead of 2)."
