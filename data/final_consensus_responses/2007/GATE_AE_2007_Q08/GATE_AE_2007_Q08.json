A larger wing does not automatically mean more or less stability; its effect depends on where its AC lies relative to the CG and on the tail contribution. If the larger wing's aerodynamic center is behind the CG, then an increase in wing lift with angle of attack produces a nose-down restoring moment (stabilizing). Increasing wing area in that configuration increases the magnitude of the stabilizing contribution of the wing, thus enhancing overall longitudinal static stability. Options A, B, and C claim a necessary (always true) effect independent of AC-CG geometry, which is incorrect. Only option D correctly states a conditional situation under which the larger wing necessarily increases stability.",

        "Recall the criterion for longitudinal static stability: $C_{m_\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0$. This stability is determined by the relative positions of the aerodynamic centers (AC) of the wing and tail, and the aircraft's center of gravity (CG).",
        "The wing's contribution to longitudinal stability depends on the relative position of its aerodynamic center ($x_{AC_{wing}}$) and the aircraft's center of gravity ($x_{CG}$). If $x_{AC_{wing}} > x_{CG}$ (AC behind CG), the wing provides a nose-down (stabilizing) moment. If $x_{AC_{wing}} < x_{CG}$ (AC ahead of CG), it provides a nose-up (destabilizing) moment. The wing's contribution to the pitching moment derivative is given by $C_{m_\\alpha_{wing}} = -a_w \\left( \\frac{x_{AC_{wing}} - x_{CG}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$.",
        "A 'larger wing' implies an increased wing area ($S_w$) and potentially mean aerodynamic chord ($\\bar{c}$). If the wing's aerodynamic center is behind the aircraft's center of gravity ($x_{AC_{wing}} > x_{CG}$), then the wing's contribution to stability is stabilizing. A larger wing, in this configuration, will increase the magnitude of this stabilizing moment, thus increasing the overall longitudinal static stability of the airplane. This is because the moment contribution scales with wing area and lift. Therefore, an airplane with a larger wing will necessarily have more longitudinal static stability *if* the aerodynamic center of the larger wing is behind the center of gravity of the airplane (Option D). Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the effect of wing size on stability is conditional and not universally true without considering the AC-CG relationship.",
        "For an aft-tail airplane, the horizontal tail provides a stabilizing contribution. The tail volume ratio $V_h = \\frac{S_t l_t}{S_w \\bar{c}}$ decreases if $S_w$ and $\\bar{c}$ increase while tail parameters are fixed, potentially reducing the tail's relative effectiveness. However, the overall stability depends on the wing's contribution, where the sign (stabilizing or destabilizing) is determined by the relative position of the wing's aerodynamic center ($x_{AC_w}$) and the center of gravity ($x_{CG}$).",
        "If the larger wing’s aerodynamic center ($x_{AC_w}$) is behind the CG ($x_{CG}$), then the term $(x_{AC_w} - x_{CG})$ is positive, making the wing's pitching moment derivative ($C_{m_\\alpha,wing}$) negative and thus stabilizing. In this scenario, increasing $S_w$ makes $C_{m_\\alpha,wing}$ more negative, leading to increased stability. This highlights why a larger wing does not *always* increase stability; it depends on the wing's AC position relative to the CG.",
        "In an aft-tail airplane, the horizontal tail is typically located behind the CG and provides a stabilizing contribution. Therefore, if both the wing's aerodynamic center and the tail are stabilizing (i.e., wing AC behind CG, and tail providing positive stability), increasing wing size further enhances overall longitudinal static stability. This aligns with the specific condition described in option D.",
        "Consequently, there is no unconditional rule stating that a larger wing always increases or decreases stability. The effect is conditional, and only the specific scenario where the wing's aerodynamic center is behind the center of gravity in an aft-tail airplane configuration necessarily leads to enhanced longitudinal static stability."
