      "reasoning": "The problem describes a composite circular shaft made of two materials, A (inner core) and B (outer sleeve), rigidly connected and of the same length `L`. When subjected to a pure torsional moment `T`, the following conditions apply:\n\n1.  **Compatibility Condition**: Since the inner core and outer sleeve are rigidly connected and have the same length, they must undergo the same angle of twist `$\\phi$`. Therefore, `$\\phi_A = \\phi_B = \\phi$`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Condition**: The total applied torque `T` is shared between the inner core and the outer sleeve. Thus, `T = T_A + T_B`.\n\n3.  **Angle of Twist Formula**: For a single circular shaft, the angle of twist is given by `$\\phi = \\frac{T L}{G J}$`. Rearranging this, the torque `T` for a given angle of twist `$\\phi$` is `T = \\frac{G J \\phi}{L}$`.\n\nApplying this to each component:\n*   For material A: `T_A = \\frac{G_A J_A \\phi}{L}$`\n*   For material B: `T_B = \\frac{G_B J_B \\phi}{L}$`\n\nSubstitute these expressions for `T_A` and `T_B` into the equilibrium equation:\n`T = \\frac{G_A J_A \\phi}{L} + \\frac{G_B J_B \\phi}{L}$`\n\nFactor out `$\\frac{\\phi}{L}$`:\n`T = \\frac{\\phi}{L} (G_A J_A + G_B J_B)$`\n\nThe torsional stiffness is defined as `$\\frac{T}{\\phi}$`.\n`$\\frac{T}{\\phi} = \\frac{G_A J_A + G_B J_B}{L}$`\n\nThis matches option B."

        "description": "This method models each component of the composite shaft as a torsional spring. For co-axial components experiencing the same angle of twist (a parallel connection), their individual torsional stiffnesses ($k = GJ/L$) are added directly, similar to linear springs in parallel. Thus, the total stiffness is $k_{total} = k_A + k_B = \\frac{G_A J_A}{L} + \\frac{G_B J_B}{L}$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Simplifies conceptual understanding, intuitive, quick for students familiar with spring analogies, and involves minimal algebra. Cons: Can be confusing if the analogy isn't clearly understood or if the problem setup deviates from a simple parallel connection, requiring prior understanding of when elements are in parallel vs. series.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for quick conceptual checks, rapid reasoning in exams, or when the problem structure clearly fits the parallel connection model (co-axial components with common length and angle of twist) and the student is comfortable with torsional spring analogies."
