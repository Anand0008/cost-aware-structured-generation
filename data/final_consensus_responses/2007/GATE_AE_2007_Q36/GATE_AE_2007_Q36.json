      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the stagnation pressure measured by a Pitot tube. This involves several steps:\n1.  Calculate the static pressure (p) at the given altitude using the Ideal Gas Law ($p = \\rho R T$) with the provided temperature and density at 10km.\n2.  Convert the Indicated Airspeed (IAS) to True Airspeed (TAS) using the relationship $V_{TAS} = V_{IAS} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{SL}}{\\rho}}$, where $\\rho_{SL}$ is the sea-level density and $\\rho$ is the density at altitude. The airspeed indicator is calibrated for sea-level density.\n3.  Calculate the dynamic pressure (q) at the altitude using the True Airspeed: $q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_{TAS}^2$.\n4.  Finally, determine the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) by adding the static pressure and dynamic pressure: $P_0 = p + q$.\nFollowing these steps with the given values leads to a stagnation pressure of approximately $2.87 \\times 10^4$ N/m², which matches option C."
