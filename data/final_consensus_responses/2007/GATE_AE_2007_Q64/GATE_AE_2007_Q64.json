      "reasoning": "For inviscid, incompressible, irrotational flow of a uniform stream of speed $U_{\\infty}$ past a circular cylinder (without circulation), the tangential velocity on the surface ($r=R$) is given by $V_{\\theta} = -2 U_{\\infty} \\sin\\theta$. The speed along the surface is the magnitude of this velocity, $V_s = |V_{\\theta}| = 2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin\\theta|$. The question asks for the angular positions where the speed along the surface is equal to the free stream speed, i.e., $V_s = U_{\\infty}$.\n\nSetting the two equal: $2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin\\theta| = U_{\\infty}$.\nAssuming $U_{\\infty} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $U_{\\infty}$: $2 |\\sin\\theta| = 1$.\nThis simplifies to $|\\sin\\theta| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis condition is satisfied when $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nRelative to the forward stagnation point (where $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$), the angles in the range $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}$ are:\n- For $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$: $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta = 150^{\\circ}$ ($180^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}$).\n- For $\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\theta = 210^{\\circ}$ ($180^{\\circ} + 30^{\\circ}$) and $\\theta = 330^{\\circ}$ ($360^{\\circ} - 30^{\\circ}$).\n\nThus, the angular positions are $30^{\\circ}, 150^{\\circ}, 210^{\\circ}$, and $330^{\\circ}$. This matches option A. This is also consistent with the condition for $C_p=0$, as $C_p = 1 - (V_s/U_{\\infty})^2$, so $C_p=0$ implies $V_s = U_{\\infty}$."

        "Step 1: Understand the problem statement. The question asks for angular positions on the surface of a circular cylinder in an ideal uniform flow where the fluid speed on the surface is equal to the freestream speed.",
        "Step 2: Recall the velocity field for potential flow past a non-lifting circular cylinder. On the cylinder surface ($r=R$), the radial velocity is zero and the tangential velocity is $V_{\\theta} = -2 U_{\\infty} \\sin\\theta$. The speed on the surface, $V_s$, is the magnitude of this tangential velocity: $V_s = |V_{\\theta}| = |-2 U_{\\infty} \\sin\\theta| = 2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin\\theta|$.",
        "Step 3: Set up the condition given in the problem. We need to find $\\theta$ such that the surface speed $V_s$ is equal to the freestream speed $U_{\\infty}$. So, $2 U_{\\infty} |\\sin\\theta| = U_{\\infty}$.",
        "Step 4: Solve the equation for $|\\sin\\theta|$. Divide both sides by $U_{\\infty}$ (assuming $U_{\\infty} \\neq 0$): $2 |\\sin\\theta| = 1$, which gives $|\\sin\\theta| = \\frac{1}{2}$.",
        "Step 5: Determine the angles $\\theta$ that satisfy $|\\sin\\theta| = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}$.",
        "Step 6: Find the specific angular positions in the range $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}$.

Therefore, we can set $C_p = 0$ and solve for $\\theta$: $0 = 1 - 4\\sin^2(\\theta) \\implies 4\\sin^2(\\theta) = 1 \\implies \\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies \\sin(\\theta) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.
