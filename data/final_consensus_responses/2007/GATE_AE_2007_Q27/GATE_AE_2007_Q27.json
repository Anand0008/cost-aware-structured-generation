The problem states two airfoils are from the same family (geometrically similar), at the same angle of attack, and implicitly in the same flow conditions (same freestream velocity and fluid, hence same Mach and Reynolds numbers). The absolute size difference (one being twice the other) does not affect nondimensional coefficients.",
