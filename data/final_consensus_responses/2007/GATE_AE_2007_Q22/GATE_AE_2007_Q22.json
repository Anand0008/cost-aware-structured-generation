      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the correct statement among four given properties of square matrices P and Q. Each statement needs to be evaluated based on fundamental rules of matrix algebra.\n\n**Statement (i): PQ = 0 implies P = 0 or Q = 0 or both**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. Unlike scalar multiplication, in matrix algebra, the product of two non-zero matrices can be a zero matrix (zero divisors exist). For example, let $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. Neither P nor Q is a zero matrix, but $PQ = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$.\n\n**Statement (ii): PQ = I² implies P = Q⁻¹**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. Since $I^2 = I$, the condition simplifies to $PQ = I$. For square matrices P and Q of the same size, if their product $PQ = I$ (where I is the identity matrix), it means that Q is the right inverse of P. A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that for square matrices, if a right inverse exists, it is also the unique two-sided inverse. Therefore, $Q = P^{-1}$ and consequently $P = Q^{-1}$.\n\n**Statement (iii): (P + Q)² = P² + 2PQ + Q²**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The expansion of $(P + Q)^2$ is $(P + Q)(P + Q) = P(P + Q) + Q(P + Q) = P^2 + PQ + QP + Q^2$. For the given statement to be true, it would require $PQ + QP = 2PQ$, which implies $QP = PQ$. However, matrix multiplication is generally **not commutative** ($PQ \\neq QP$). Therefore, this identity does not hold true for arbitrary square matrices.\n\n**Statement (iv): (P - Q)² = P² - 2PQ + Q²**\nThis statement is also **FALSE**. The expansion of $(P - Q)^2$ is $(P - Q)(P - Q) = P(P - Q) - Q(P - Q) = P^2 - PQ - QP + Q^2$. Similar to statement (iii), for this identity to hold, it would require $-PQ - QP = -2PQ$, which implies $QP = PQ$. Since matrix multiplication is generally not commutative, this identity is not true for arbitrary square matrices.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement (ii) is correct. Thus, option D is the correct choice."

        "Step 1: Analyze statement (i) `PQ = 0` implies `P = 0` or `Q = 0` or both. This statement is false for matrices. Unlike scalars, the product of two non-zero matrices can be the zero matrix. For example, let P = [[1,0],[0,0]] and Q = [[0,0],[0,1]]. Then PQ = [[0,0],[0,0]] = 0, but neither P nor Q is the zero matrix.",
        "Step 2: Analyze statement (ii) `PQ = I²` implies `P = Q⁻¹`. First, note that `I² = I` for the identity matrix. So the statement simplifies to `PQ = I` implies `P = Q⁻¹`. For square matrices, if `PQ = I`, then P is the right inverse of Q. For square matrices, a right inverse is also a left inverse, meaning `QP = I`, and thus P is the unique inverse of Q, i.e., `P = Q⁻¹`. Therefore, statement (ii) is true.",
        "Step 3: Analyze statement (iii) `(P + Q)² = P² + 2PQ + Q²`. Expand the left side: `(P + Q)(P + Q) = P² + PQ + QP + Q²`. For this to equal `P² + 2PQ + Q²`, it requires `PQ = QP`, which means matrix multiplication must be commutative. However, matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. For example, let P = [[0,1],[0,0]] and Q = [[1,0],[0,0]]. Then PQ = [[0,0],[0,0]] and QP = [[0,1],[0,0]], so PQ ≠ QP. Thus, statement (iii) is false.",
        "Step 4: Analyze statement (iv) `(P - Q)² = P² - 2PQ + Q²`. Expand the left side: `(P - Q)(P - Q) = P² - PQ - QP + Q²`. Similar to statement (iii), this equality holds only if `PQ = QP`. Since matrix multiplication is generally not commutative, statement (iv) is also false. The same counterexample used for statement (iii) applies here.",
        "Step 5: Conclude that only statement (ii) is always true for arbitrary square matrices P and Q. Statements (i), (iii), and (iv) are generally false due to the non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication and the zero product property for matrices.",
        "Step 6: Based on the analysis, only statement (ii) is correct. Therefore, the option corresponding to statement (ii) being true is the answer."
