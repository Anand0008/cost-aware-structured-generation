The gradient of a scalar function is defined as the vector of these partial derivatives. Therefore, if all partial derivatives are zero, the gradient vector vanishes (becomes the zero vector) at a stationary point. Options involving curl and divergence are incorrect because these operators are applied to vector fields, not scalar functions. Furthermore, the gradient represents the direction of the maximum rate of change; at a stationary point, the rate of change is zero, not maximum."
