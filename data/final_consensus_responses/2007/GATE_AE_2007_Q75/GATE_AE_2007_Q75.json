      "reasoning": "To find the natural frequencies of a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, we need to derive its equations of motion, form the mass ([M]) and stiffness ([K]) matrices, and then solve the characteristic equation `det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0`.\n\n**1. Equations of Motion (EOMs):**\nLet $x_1$ be the displacement of mass $m$ and $x_2$ be the displacement of mass $3m$. We assume positive displacement to the right.\n\n*   **For mass $m$:**\n    Forces acting on $m$: \n    - From left spring $k$: $-k x_1$ (restoring force)\n    - From middle spring $k$: $k (x_2 - x_1)$ (relative displacement)\n    Using Newton's second law: $m \\ddot{x}_1 = -k x_1 + k (x_2 - x_1)$ \n    $m \\ddot{x}_1 + 2k x_1 - k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 1)\n\n*   **For mass $3m$:**\n    Forces acting on $3m$: \n    - From middle spring $k$: $-k (x_2 - x_1)$ (relative displacement, opposite to $m$)\n    - From right spring $k$: $-k x_2$ (restoring force)\n    Using Newton's second law: $3m \\ddot{x}_2 = -k (x_2 - x_1) - k x_2$ \n    $3m \\ddot{x}_2 - k x_1 + 2k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 2)\n\n**2. Matrix Formulation:**\nAssume a harmonic solution of the form $x_1 = A_1 \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $x_2 = A_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$. \nThen $\\ddot{x}_1 = -\\omega^2 A_1 \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $\\ddot{x}_2 = -\\omega^2 A_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\nSubstitute these into the EOMs and cancel $\\sin(\\omega t)$:\n$(2k - m\\omega^2) A_1 - k A_2 = 0$\n$-k A_1 + (2k - 3m\\omega^2) A_2 = 0$\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as $([K] - \\omega^2[M])\\{A\\} = \\{0\\}$, where:\n$[K] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2k & -k \\\\ -k & 2k \\end{bmatrix}$ (Stiffness Matrix)\n$[M] = \\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3m \\end{bmatrix}$ (Mass Matrix)\n\n**3. Characteristic Equation:**\nFor non-trivial solutions (i.e., amplitudes $A_1, A_2$ are not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$\\det\\begin{bmatrix} 2k - m\\omega^2 & -k \\\\ -k & 2k - 3m\\omega^2 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\n\n**4. Solving the Determinant:**\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)(2k - 3m\\omega^2) - (-k)(-k) = 0$\n$4k^2 - 6mk\\omega^2 - 2mk\\omega^2 + 3m^2\\omega^4 - k^2 = 0$\n$3m^2\\omega^4 - 8mk\\omega^2 + 3k^2 = 0$\n\n**5. Solving for $\\omega^2$ (Eigenvalues):**\nLet $\\lambda = \\omega^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $\\lambda$:\n$3m^2\\lambda^2 - 8mk\\lambda + 3k^2 = 0$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{(-8mk)^2 - 4(3m^2)(3k^2)}}{2(3m^2)}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{64m^2k^2 - 36m^2k^2}}{6m^2}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm \\sqrt{28m^2k^2}}{6m^2}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm mk\\sqrt{28}}{6m^2}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{8mk \\pm mk(2\\sqrt{7})}{6m^2}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2mk(4 \\pm \\sqrt{7})}{6m^2}$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{(4 \\pm \\sqrt{7})k}{3m}$\n\n**6. Natural Frequencies:**\nSince $\\lambda = \\omega^2$, the natural frequencies are $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$:\n$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{(4 \\pm \\sqrt{7})k}{3m}}$\n\nThis result matches option C."
