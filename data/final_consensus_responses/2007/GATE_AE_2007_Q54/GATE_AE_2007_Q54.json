      "reasoning": "The question asks for the shear stress distribution $\\tau_{xz}$ across a rectangular cross-section of an Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to a transverse shear force $V_z$. The vertical coordinate is denoted by $z$, and the total height of the beam is $h$. The general formula for transverse shear stress in a beam is given by the flexure shear formula:\n\n$\\tau = \\frac{VQ}{Ib}$\n\nWhere:\n- $V$ is the transverse shear force, which is $V_z$ in this case.\n- $Q$ is the first moment of area of the section above (or below) the point where shear stress is calculated, about the neutral axis.\n- $I$ is the moment of inertia of the entire cross-section about the neutral axis, which is $I_y$ in this case.\n- $b$ is the width of the cross-section at the point where $\\tau$ is calculated.\n\nFor a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and height $h$:\n1.  **Moment of Inertia ($I_y$):** About the neutral axis (y-axis in the given coordinate system), $I_y = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$.\n2.  **First Moment of Area ($Q(z)$):** Consider the area $A'$ above a distance $z$ from the neutral axis. The area is $A' = b \\left( \\frac{h}{2} - z \\right)$. The centroid of this area $A'$ from the neutral axis is $\\bar{z}' = z + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} - z \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} + z \\right)$.\n    Therefore, $Q(z) = A' \\bar{z}' = b \\left( \\frac{h}{2} - z \\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} + z \\right) = \\frac{b}{2} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right)$.\n3.  **Width ($b$):** For a rectangular section, the width $b$ is constant across the depth.\n\nSubstitute these into the flexure shear formula:\n\n$\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z \\left[ \\frac{b}{2} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right) \\right]}{I_y b}$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z}{2I_y} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right)$\n\nTo match the options, factor out $\\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2$ from the term in parentheses:\n\n$\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z}{2I_y} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{z^2}{\\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2} \\right)$\n\nThis derived expression exactly matches Option B. This formula correctly shows a parabolic distribution of shear stress, which is zero at the top and bottom surfaces ($z = \\pm h/2$) and maximum at the neutral axis ($z=0$).\n\nTo further confirm, the term $\\frac{V_z (h/2)^2}{2I_y}$ represents the maximum shear stress, $\\tau_{max}$, at the neutral axis. Substituting $I_y = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$:\n$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{V_z (h^2/4)}{2 (bh^3/12)} = \\frac{V_z h^2/4}{bh^3/6} = \\frac{6 V_z}{4bh} = \\frac{3 V_z}{2bh}$.\nSince $bh$ is the cross-sectional area $A$, $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V_z}{A} = 1.5 \\tau_{avg}$, which is a well-known result for rectangular sections."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the problem and given information. The question asks for the shear stress distribution $\\tau_{xz}$ in a rectangular beam under a transverse shear force $V_z$. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with width $b$ and height $h$, and $z$ is the vertical distance from the neutral axis. This problem involves Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.",
        "Step 2: Recall the general shear formula for beams. The transverse shear stress $\\tau$ in a beam is given by $\\tau = \\frac{VQ}{Ib}$, where $V$ is the internal shear force ($V_z$ in this case), $Q$ is the first moment of area of the portion of the cross-section above (or below) the level where $\\tau$ is evaluated, $I$ is the second moment of area (moment of inertia) about the neutral axis, and $b$ is the width of the cross-section at that level.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the moment of inertia for the rectangular cross-section. For a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and height $h$, the moment of inertia about the neutral axis (y-axis) is $I_y = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the first moment of area, $Q(z)$. For the area above a distance $z$ from the neutral axis, the area $A'$ is $b \\left( \\frac{h}{2} - z \\right)$. The centroid of this area from the neutral axis is $\\bar{z}' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} + z \\right)$. Thus, $Q(z) = A' \\bar{z}' = \\frac{b}{2} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right)$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the parameters into the shear formula. Substitute $V_z$, $Q(z)$, $I_y$, and $b$ into the flexure shear formula: $\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z \\left[ \\frac{b}{2} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right) \\right]}{I_y b}$.",
        "Step 6: Simplify the expression. Simplify the equation to $\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z}{2I_y} \\left( \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 - z^2 \\right)$. To match the common parabolic form, factor out $\\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2$: $\\tau_{xz}(z) = \\frac{V_z}{2I_y} \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{z^2}{\\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right)^2} \\right)$.",
        "Step 7: Verify boundary conditions and confirm the result. The derived expression shows a parabolic distribution. At $z = \\pm h/2$ (top and bottom surfaces), $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, which is correct. At $z=0$ (neutral axis), $\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{V_z (h/2)^2}{2 I_y} = \\frac{V_z h^2}{8 I_y}$. Substituting $I_y = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$, we get $\\tau_{xz}(0) = \\frac{V_z h^2}{8 (bh^3/12)} = \\frac{12 V_z h^2}{8 bh^3} = \\frac{3 V_z}{2 bh}$. This is the known maximum shear stress for a rectangular section (1.5 times the average shear stress $V_z/(bh)$). This confirms the correctness of the derived distribution."
