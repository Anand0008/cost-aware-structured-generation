      "reasoning": "The problem specifies a one-dimensional, incompressible, frictionless flow in a constant area duct combustor. Heat addition occurs, as indicated by the change in stagnation temperature.\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation for Incompressible Flow**: For steady, one-dimensional, incompressible flow ($\\rho = \\text{constant}$) in a constant area duct ($A = \\text{constant}$), the mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V$ implies that the velocity $V$ must be constant throughout the combustor ($V_1 = V_2 = V$).\n\n2.  **Momentum Equation for Frictionless Flow**: For a constant area, frictionless flow, the momentum equation simplifies to $P_1 + \\rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \\rho V_2^2$. Since $V_1 = V_2$, this further simplifies to $P_1 = P_2$, meaning the static pressure remains constant across the combustor.\n\n3.  **Stagnation Pressure Definition**: For incompressible flow, stagnation pressure is defined as $P_0 = P + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$. Since both static pressure ($P$) and velocity ($V$) are constant across the combustor ($P_1 = P_2$ and $V_1 = V_2$), it follows that the stagnation pressure also remains constant ($P_{01} = P_{02}$). Therefore, the stagnation pressure loss, $\\Delta P_0 = P_{01} - P_{02}$, is zero.\n\n4.  **Pressure Loss Factor**: The pressure loss factor is defined as the stagnation pressure loss non-dimensionalized by the inlet dynamic pressure: $\\frac{\\Delta P_0}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2}$. Since $\\Delta P_0 = 0$, the pressure loss factor is $\\frac{0}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2} = 0$.\n\nThe given stagnation temperatures (540 K and 1104 K) indicate heat addition, which would typically cause stagnation pressure loss in a real, compressible flow. However, under the strict idealized assumptions of incompressible and frictionless flow, the stagnation pressure remains constant. The temperature values serve as distractors if the fundamental assumptions are not correctly applied."

        "Step 2: Apply the continuity equation for incompressible flow in a constant area duct. Since mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V$ and density $\\rho$ and area $A$ are constant, the velocity $V$ must be constant throughout the combustor ($V_1 = V_2$).",

        "Step 4: Define stagnation pressure for incompressible flow. Stagnation pressure is given by $P_0 = p + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2$. Since both static pressure $p$ and velocity $V$ (and thus dynamic pressure $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2$) are constant throughout the combustor, the stagnation pressure $P_0$ must also be constant. Therefore, $P_{01} = P_{02}$.",
