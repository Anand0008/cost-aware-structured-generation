        "Identify the given data and calculate the wing's geometric properties. The wing has a rectangular planform with chord ($c$) = 0.2 m and span ($b$) = 1.2 m. The wing area is $S = b \\times c = 1.2 \\times 0.2 = 0.24 \\text{ m}^2$. The aspect ratio is $AR = b/c = 1.2/0.2 = 6$. The airfoil lift curve slope ($a_{0,deg}$) is 0.1 per degree, angle of attack ($\\alpha_{deg}$) is 8 degrees, freestream velocity ($V$) is 20 m/s, lift ($L$) is 35.3 N, and air density ($\\rho$) is 1.225 kg/m³.",
        "Calculate the wing's lift coefficient ($C_L$). Use the lift equation: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. Rearranging for $C_L$: $C_L = \\frac{L}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S}$. Substituting the values: $C_L = \\frac{35.3 \\text{ N}}{0.5 \\times 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (20 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\times 0.24 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{35.3}{58.8} \\approx 0.60034$.",
        "Determine the wing's actual lift curve slope ($a_{wing,deg}$). For a symmetric airfoil, the zero-lift angle of attack is 0 degrees. Therefore, $C_L = a_{wing,deg} \\times \\alpha_{deg}$. Rearranging for $a_{wing,deg}$: $a_{wing,deg} = \\frac{C_L}{\\alpha_{deg}} = \\frac{0.60034}{8 \\text{ deg}} \\approx 0.07504 \\text{ per degree}$.",
        "Apply the formula relating the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_{0,deg}$) to the 3D wing lift curve slope ($a_{wing,deg}$), incorporating the span efficiency factor ($e$). The formula, with slopes in per degree, is: $a_{wing,deg} = \\frac{a_{0,deg}}{1 + \\frac{a_{0,deg} \\times 180}{\\pi^2 AR e}}$.",
        "Solve the equation for the span efficiency factor ($e$). Substitute the known values: $0.07504 = \\frac{0.1}{1 + \\frac{0.1 \\times 180}{\\pi^2 \\times 6 \\times e}}$. Simplify: $1 + \\frac{18}{6 \\pi^2 e} = \\frac{0.1}{0.07504} \\approx 1.3326$. This simplifies to $1 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} \\approx 1.3326$. Further simplification yields $\\frac{3}{\\pi^2 e} \\approx 0.3326$. Solving for $e$: $e = \\frac{3}{\\pi^2 \\times 0.3326} \\approx \\frac{9.0207}{\\pi^2} \\approx \\frac{9.0207}{9.8696} \\approx 0.9139$. Rounding to two decimal places, $e \\approx 0.91$.",

        "name": "Direct Calculation of Span Efficiency Factor",
        "description": "Instead of using the formula $e = 1 / (1 + \\delta)$, one can directly calculate the span efficiency factor from the Fourier coefficients of the lift distribution using the formula $e = 1 / \\sqrt{1 + \\delta}$, where $\\delta = \\sum_{n=2}^{N} n (A_n/A_1)^2$.",
        "pros_cons": "This direct calculation method is more mathematically rigorous but requires more detailed knowledge of the lift distribution Fourier coefficients, which may not always be available.",
        "when_to_use": "In conceptual/theoretical questions or when the circulation distribution is explicitly given."

    "connections_to_other_subjects": {
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The concept of span efficiency factor is closely related to the study of flow around finite wings and the formation of the wake, which is a fundamental topic in fluid mechanics.",
      "Aircraft Design": "The span efficiency factor is a crucial parameter in the aerodynamic design of aircraft wings, as it directly impacts the induced drag and overall performance.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "The span efficiency factor 'e' is a direct input to the aircraft drag polar, which is used in performance equations for climb, cruise, and endurance."
