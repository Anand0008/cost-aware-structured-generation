The governing wave equation for longitudinal vibration in a uniform rod is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}$\n\nAssuming a harmonic solution of the form $u(x,t) = \\phi(x) \\sin(\\omega t + \\alpha)$ (or using separation of variables $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$), the spatial part $\\phi(x)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation:\n\n$\\phi''(x) + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\phi(x) = 0$\n\nLet $\\beta = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ be the wave number. The general solution for $\\phi(x)$ is:\n\n$\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\beta x) + C_2 \\cos(\\beta x)$\n\nFor a rod fixed at $x=0$ and free at $x=L$, the boundary conditions are:\n\n1.  **Fixed end at $x=0$**: The displacement is zero. So, $u(0,t) = 0 \\implies \\phi(0) = 0$.\n    Applying this to the general solution: $C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n    Thus, the simplified mode shape is: $\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\beta x)$.\n\n2.  **Free end at $x=L$**: The internal axial force is zero. For longitudinal vibration, axial force is proportional to axial strain ($EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$). Therefore, the strain must be zero at the free end: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} |_{x=L} = 0 \\implies \\phi'(L) = 0$.\n    First, find the derivative of $\\phi(x)$: $\\phi'(x) = C_1 \\beta \\cos(\\beta x)$.\n    Applying the boundary condition at $x=L$: $C_1 \\beta \\cos(\\beta L) = 0$.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution (i.e., $C_1 \\neq 0$ and $\\beta \\neq 0$), we must have: $\\cos(\\beta L) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ back into the characteristic equation, we get:\n\n$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{c}\\right) = 0$\n\nThis equation gives the natural frequencies of the fixed-free rod and matches option A."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the 1D wave equation for longitudinal vibration of a rod: $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}$. Assume a separable solution of the form $u(x,t) = \\phi(x)T(t)$, where $T(t)$ is a harmonic function of time.",
        "Step 2: Substitute $u(x,t) = \\phi(x)T(t)$ into the wave equation and perform separation of variables. This leads to the spatial ordinary differential equation: $\\phi''(x) + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 \\phi(x) = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the natural frequency and $c$ is the wave speed.",
        "Step 3: The general solution for the spatial mode shape $\\phi(x)$ is $\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right) + C_2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right)$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the fixed-end boundary condition at $x=0$. A fixed end implies zero displacement, so $u(0,t)=0 \\implies \\phi(0)=0$. Substituting this into the general solution gives $C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$. The simplified mode shape is $\\phi(x) = C_1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right)$.",
        "Step 5: Apply the free-end boundary condition at $x=L$. A free end implies zero axial force, which means zero axial strain. Therefore, the derivative of displacement with respect to $x$ must be zero at $x=L$: $\\phi'(L)=0$. First, differentiate the simplified mode shape: $\\phi'(x) = C_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right)$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute $x=L$ into the derivative and set it to zero: $C_1 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{c}\\right) = 0$.",
        "Step 7: For a non-trivial solution (i.e., $C_1 \\neq 0$ and $\\frac{\\omega}{c} \\neq 0$), the term $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{c}\\right)$ must be zero. Thus, the characteristic equation for the natural frequencies is $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega L}{c}\\right) = 0$.",
