      "reasoning": "For a satellite to remain in a stable orbit, there is a precise balance between the Earth's gravitational attraction pulling it inwards and the centripetal force required for its circular motion. In a non-inertial (rotating) frame of reference moving with the satellite, this centripetal force is conceptualized as an outward 'centrifugal pseudo-force' that balances the inward gravitational pull. This dynamic equilibrium ensures the satellite continuously 'falls around' the Earth, following its curvature, rather than falling directly onto it or flying off into space. Options B and D are incorrect as satellites in stable orbits do not require continuous thrust and do not rely on aerodynamic lift in the vacuum of space. Option C describes the effect of this balance but option A provides the fundamental force balance explanation, which is the more direct physical reason expected in such questions."

        "Describe the inertial effect (centrifugal/centripetal): Due to the satellite's high tangential velocity and circular motion, an apparent outward force, known as centrifugal force, is experienced in the satellite's rotating frame of reference. Alternatively, in an inertial frame, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force.",
        "Explain the balance: For a stable orbit, this outward centrifugal force (or the centripetal force required by gravity) precisely balances the inward gravitational attraction.",
