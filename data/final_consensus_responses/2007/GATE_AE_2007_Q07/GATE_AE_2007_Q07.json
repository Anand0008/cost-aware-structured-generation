      "reasoning": "For a glider, maximum range is achieved when the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is maximized. This is because the range (R) covered during a glide from an altitude (h) is given by R = h / tan(γ) = h * (L/D). To maximize range, the glide angle (γ) must be minimized. From force balance equations for steady gliding flight, D = W sin(γ) and L = W cos(γ). Dividing these yields tan(γ) = D/L = 1/(L/D). Therefore, minimizing tan(γ) implies maximizing the L/D ratio, which results in the shallowest descent angle and the longest glide distance. Option B (minimum rate of descent) corresponds to maximum endurance, not range. Option C (maximum descent angle) is incorrect. Option D (maximum lift-to-weight ratio) is not the primary condition for maximum range."

        "Step 3: Determine the condition for maximum range. To achieve the minimum glide angle (γ_min) and thus maximum range, \\tan(\\gamma) must be minimized. This implies that the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) must be maximized.",
        "Relate the glide angle to the horizontal range. The horizontal range (R) from an initial altitude (h) is given by R = h / tan(γ). This can also be expressed as R = h * (L/D). Therefore, to maximize R for a given h, we must maximize (L/D).",
        "Determine the condition for maximum range. For maximum range, R must be maximized. Since R = h / tan(γ), this means tan(γ) must be minimized. Minimizing tan(γ) is equivalent to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D). This condition also corresponds to the minimum glide angle.",
