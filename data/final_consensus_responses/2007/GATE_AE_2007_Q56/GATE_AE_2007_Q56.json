This critical condition implies that the pressure thrust term $(p_e - p_{\\infty})A_e$ in the general thrust equation becomes zero. Therefore, the thrust produced by the engine simplifies to the momentum thrust, which is the product of the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) and the exhaust exit velocity ($V_e$).\n\nGiven:\nMass flow rate, $\\dot{m} = 719 \\text{ kg/s}$\nExhaust exit velocity, $V_e = 1794 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nUsing the simplified thrust formula for optimum expansion:\n$F = \\dot{m} \\times V_e$\n$F = 719 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 1794 \\text{ m/s}$\n$F = 1290186 \\text{ N}$\n\nTo match the options, convert Newtons to kilonewtons:\n$F = 1290186 \\text{ N} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ kN}}{1000 \\text{ N}} = 1290.186 \\text{ kN}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 1290 kN perfectly matches option B.
