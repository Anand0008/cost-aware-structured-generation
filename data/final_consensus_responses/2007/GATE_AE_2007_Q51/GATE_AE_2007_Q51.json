        "name": "Approximation for Small Delta-V/Exhaust Velocity Ratio",
        "description": "For $\\Delta V / (I_{sp} g_0) \\ll 1$, use the approximation $\\ln(1+x) \\approx x$, leading to $m_p \\approx m_0 \\cdot (\\Delta V / (I_{sp} g_0))$. Here, $0.1820$ is not extremely small, so approximation gives $2000 * 0.1820 = 364$ kg, which is within 10% but not exact.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Quick mental calculation. Cons: Less accurate, especially for larger ratios.",

        "pros_cons": "This approach may be more intuitive for some students, but requires a deeper understanding of momentum conservation principles. It is equivalent to the Tsiolkovsky equation but may be more computation-intensive."
