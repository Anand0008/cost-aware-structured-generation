      "reasoning": "The given system of linear equations is a homogeneous system because all constant terms on the right-hand side are zero. For a homogeneous system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, the trivial solution ($x=y=z=0$) always exists. To determine if non-trivial solutions exist, we can examine the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$ or its rank.\n\nFirst, form the coefficient matrix $A$:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 & -1 \\\\ 2 & -2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nObserve that the third equation ($2x - 2y + 4z = 0$) is exactly twice the first equation ($x - y + 2z = 0$). This indicates that the third row of the matrix is linearly dependent on the first row, implying redundancy and that the rank of $A$ is less than 3.\n\nNext, calculate the determinant of $A$:\n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ -2 & 4 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{vmatrix} + 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & -2 \\end{vmatrix}$\n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot ((3)(4) - (-1)(-2)) + 1 \\cdot ((2)(4) - (-1)(2)) + 2 \\cdot ((2)(-2) - (3)(2))$\n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot (12 - 2) + 1 \\cdot (8 + 2) + 2 \\cdot (-4 - 6)$\n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot (10) + 1 \\cdot (10) + 2 \\cdot (-10)$\n$\\det(A) = 10 + 10 - 20$\n$\\det(A) = 0$\n\nSince $\\det(A) = 0$, the coefficient matrix is singular. For a homogeneous system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, a singular coefficient matrix (i.e., $\\det(A) = 0$ or rank(A) < number of unknowns) implies the existence of infinitely many non-trivial solutions. This is because there will be at least one free variable (number of free variables = n - rank(A) = 3 - 2 = 1), leading to an infinite set of solutions. Therefore, the system has an infinite number of non-trivial solutions."

        "Step 1: Identify the system as homogeneous ($A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$) since all right-hand side constants are zero. This implies the trivial solution ($x=y=z=0$) always exists. The goal is to determine if non-trivial solutions exist.",

        "Step 4: Calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$. \n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot ((3)(4) - (-1)(-2)) - (-1) \\cdot ((2)(4) - (-1)(2)) + 2 \\cdot ((2)(-2) - (3)(2))$\n$\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot (12 - 2) + 1 \\cdot (8 + 2) + 2 \\cdot (-4 - 6)$\n$\\det(A) = 10 + 10 - 20 = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Interpret the result. For a homogeneous system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, if the determinant of the coefficient matrix $\\det(A) = 0$, or equivalently, if the rank of $A$ is less than the number of unknowns (n=3), then the system has infinitely many non-trivial solutions.",
