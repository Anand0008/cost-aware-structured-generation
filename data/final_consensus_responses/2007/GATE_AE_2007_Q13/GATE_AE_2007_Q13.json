      "reasoning": "For a plane strain problem defined in the x-y plane, the fundamental assumptions are that the normal strain perpendicular to the plane ($\\epsilon_{zz}$) is zero, and all shear strains involving the z-direction ($\\gamma_{xz}, \\gamma_{yz}$) are zero.\n\nFrom Hooke's Law for an isotropic material:\n1.  Since $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$, and $\\gamma = \\tau/G$, it implies that the corresponding shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ (or $\\sigma_{xz}$) and $\\tau_{yz}$ (or $\\sigma_{yz}$) must be zero (assuming $G \\neq 0$).\n2.  For the normal strain $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, using the generalized Hooke's Law:\n    $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})] = 0$\n    This implies $\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = 0$, leading to $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$.\n    Since $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$ are generally non-zero due to in-plane loading, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ is generally non-zero, it follows that $\\sigma_{zz}$ is generally **non-zero**. It is an induced stress due to the constraint against out-of-plane deformation.\n3.  The in-plane normal stresses $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$ and the in-plane shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}$ (or $\\tau_{xy}$) are the primary stress components acting within the x-y plane and are generally non-zero, as they describe the applied loading and resulting deformation in that plane.\n\nTherefore, the non-zero stress terms for a plane strain problem in the x-y plane are $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, $\\sigma_{xy}$, and $\\sigma_{zz}$. This corresponds to option D."

        "For an isotropic material, applying Hooke's Law for shear (\\gamma_{ij} = \\frac{\\tau_{ij}}{G}) to the zero shear strains (\\gamma_{xz} = 0 and \\gamma_{yz} = 0) implies that the corresponding shear stresses are also zero: \\tau_{xz} = 0 and \\tau_{yz} = 0.",

        "Since \\sigma_x and \\sigma_y (or \\sigma_{xx} and \\sigma_{yy}) are generally non-zero due to in-plane loading, and Poisson's ratio \\nu is non-zero for most materials, \\sigma_z (or \\sigma_{zz}) will generally be non-zero. It is an induced stress.",

        "name": "Stress Function Approach for Plane Strain",
        "description": "Instead of directly using the stress-strain relations, the plane strain problem can be formulated in terms of a stress function (e.g., Airy Stress Function) that satisfies the equilibrium and compatibility equations. This approach is more general and can handle more complex geometries and loading conditions.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More versatile, can handle complex geometries. Cons: Requires deeper understanding of stress functions and partial differential equations.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for understanding the underlying principles, for derivation-based questions, or when there is uncertainty about the direct recall of conditions."
