We know that $1 \\text{ N} = 1 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2$. Therefore, $1 \\text{ Ns/m} = (1 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2) \\cdot \\text{s/m} = 1 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n\nThus, $2 \\text{ kg/s}$ is dimensionally equivalent to $2 \\text{ Ns/m}$. Comparing this result with the given options, Option A ($2 \\text{ Ns/m}$) is the correct answer."
