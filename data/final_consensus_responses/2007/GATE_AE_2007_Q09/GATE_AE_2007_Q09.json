The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -b/(2a)$. Here $b=-7$, $a=1$, so $x = -(-7)/(2*1) = 7/2$. This matches option A."

        "Step 1: Identify the function and its type. The given function is $J(x) = x^2 - 7x + 30$. This is a quadratic function of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ ($a=1$) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, indicating that it has a global minimum.",
        "Step 2: Extract coefficients. From the function $J(x) = x^2 - 7x + 30$, identify the coefficients: $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = 30$.",
        "Step 3: Apply the vertex formula. For a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$, the x-coordinate of the vertex (where the minimum or maximum occurs) is given by the formula $x = -b/(2a)$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the x-coordinate of the minimum. Substitute the extracted coefficients into the vertex formula: $x = -(-7) / (2 * 1) = 7/2$.",
        "Step 5 (Alternative Method: Using Calculus). Alternatively, to find the minimum using calculus, first calculate the derivative of $J(x)$: $J'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 7x + 30) = 2x - 7$.",
        "Step 6 (Alternative Method: Set derivative to zero). Set the first derivative to zero to find the critical point: $2x - 7 = 0 \\implies 2x = 7 \\implies x = 7/2$.",
        "Step 7 (Verification). To confirm this is a minimum, either note that $a=1 > 0$ for the quadratic, or use the second derivative test: $J''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x - 7) = 2$. Since $J''(x) = 2 > 0$, the critical point at $x = 7/2$ corresponds to a local minimum. Both methods confirm that the minimum value of $J(x)$ occurs at $x = 7/2$."
