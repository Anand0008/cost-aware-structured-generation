      "reasoning": "The critical Mach number (M_cr) is the freestream Mach number at which sonic flow (local Mach number = 1) first appears on the airfoil surface. At this point, the drag coefficient remains nearly constant. The drag-divergence Mach number (M_dd) is the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient begins to rise sharply and suddenly. This sharp increase is due to the strengthening of shock waves, leading to significant wave drag and boundary layer separation, and the rapid expansion of the supersonic region on the airfoil. The drag divergence Mach number is always higher than the critical Mach number. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

        "Define the Critical Mach Number (M_cr) as the freestream Mach number at which the local flow velocity at any point on the airfoil surface first reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1). At this point, the drag coefficient has not yet significantly increased.",
        "Define the Drag Divergence Mach Number (M_dd) as the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient of an airfoil begins to increase sharply and rapidly. This sharp increase is caused by the formation of strong shock waves and significant boundary layer separation on the airfoil surface, leading to wave drag.",
        "As the freestream Mach number (M∞) increases beyond M_cr, a small pocket of supersonic flow develops on the airfoil surface, terminated by a weak shock wave. In this initial phase, the drag coefficient does not increase significantly.",
        "As M∞ continues to increase, the supersonic region expands and the terminating shock wave becomes much stronger. At the Drag Divergence Mach Number (M_dd), this shock is strong enough to cause significant boundary layer separation and a sharp increase in pressure (wave) drag.",
        "Therefore, the Drag Divergence Mach Number (M_dd) is always higher than the Critical Mach Number (M_cr) because the significant drag rise, caused by strong shocks and flow separation, occurs only after the supersonic region has expanded sufficiently beyond the initial onset of sonic flow at M_cr.",
        "Based on these definitions and the progression of transonic flow phenomena, M_dd is always greater than M_cr."
