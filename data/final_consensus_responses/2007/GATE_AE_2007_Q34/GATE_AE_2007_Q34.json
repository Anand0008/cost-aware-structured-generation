Given two data points: at $\\delta_e = -5^\\circ$ (5 degrees up, assuming positive $\\delta_e$ is trailing-edge down), $C_{m0} = 0.08$; at $\\delta_e = +5^\\circ$ (5 degrees down), $C_{m0} = 0$. The slope is calculated as $\\Delta C_m / \\Delta \\delta_e = (0 - 0.08) / (5 - (-5)) = -0.08 / 10 = -0.008$ per degree. This matches option C. The sign is negative, consistent with conventional aircraft where positive elevator deflection (down) produces a nose-down pitching moment."

        "Step 3: Recall the definition of elevator control power: $\\partial C_m / \\partial \\delta_e$ is the rate of change of pitching moment coefficient with respect to elevator deflection, holding angle of attack constant. For linear approximation, it is the slope of $C_m$ vs $\\delta_e$. Based on the sign convention, for '5 degrees up' (trailing edge up), $\\delta_{e1} = -5$ degrees, and $C_{m1} = 0.08$. For '5 degrees down' (trailing edge down), $\\delta_{e2} = +5$ degrees, and $C_{m2} = 0$.",
