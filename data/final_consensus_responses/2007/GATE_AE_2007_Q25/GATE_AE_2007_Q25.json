      "reasoning": "The fundamental relationship for pure bending in an Euler-Bernoulli beam is given by the flexure formula: $M = \\frac{EI}{\\rho}$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $E$ is Young's modulus, and $\\rho$ is the radius of curvature. For a composite beam made of two materials (A and B) subjected to a pure bending moment $M$, the key assumption is that the entire cross-section deforms with a single, common radius of curvature $\\rho$. The total bending moment $M$ is resisted by the sum of the moments carried by each material component. Each component contributes to the total flexural rigidity based on its own Young's modulus and moment of inertia about the common neutral axis. Thus, the total bending moment $M$ can be expressed as: $M = M_A + M_B$. Where $M_A$ is the moment resisted by material A, and $M_B$ is the moment resisted by material B. Using the flexure formula for each material: $M_A = \\frac{E_A I_A}{\\rho}$ and $M_B = \\frac{E_B I_B}{\\rho}$. Substituting these into the total moment equation: $M = \\frac{E_A I_A}{\\rho} + \\frac{E_B I_B}{\\rho} = \\frac{(E_A I_A + E_B I_B)}{\\rho}$. Rearranging to solve for the radius of curvature $\\rho$: $\\rho = \\frac{(E_A I_A + E_B I_B)}{M}$. This matches option A."

Specifically, eliminate options that sum E and I separately (e.g., $(E_A+E_B)(I_A+I_B)$) or incorrectly invert the relationship (e.g., $M/(E_A I_A + E_B I_B)$).",

        "description": "The transformed section method involves converting the composite cross-section into an equivalent homogeneous section of a single reference material. This is done by scaling the width of each material by its modular ratio ($n = E_i / E_{ref}$). Once transformed, standard homogeneous beam formulas can be applied to compute an equivalent moment of inertia ($I_{eq}$) about the neutral axis, allowing for the calculation of radius of curvature using $M = E_{ref} I_{eq} / \\rho$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Simplifies stress and deflection calculations by using standard homogeneous beam formulas; generalizes easily to more complex composite sections and is widely taught. Cons: Involves extra steps like calculating the transformed moment of inertia and finding a new neutral axis location; can be more complex for multi-layered composites.",
        "when_to_use": "Primarily used for calculating bending stresses and deflections in composite beams, especially when the neutral axis location needs to be determined for unsymmetrical sections, or when dealing with more than two materials."
