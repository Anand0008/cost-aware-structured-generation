      "reasoning": "For a general linear elastic anisotropic solid, the constitutive stress-strain relationship is described by the generalized Hooke's Law, involving a fourth-order stiffness tensor, $C_{ijkl}$. In its most general form, this tensor has $3^4 = 81$ components. However, due to inherent symmetries: minor symmetries ($C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl}$ and $C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$ due to symmetry of stress and strain tensors) and major symmetry ($C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$ due to the existence of a strain energy density function), the number of independent elastic constants is reduced. For the most general anisotropic material, which exhibits triclinic symmetry, the number of independent elastic constants is 21. This is a standard result in continuum mechanics and elasticity theory."

        "Step 3: Initially, a fourth-order tensor in 3D space has $3^4 = 81$ components.",

These include minor symmetries ($C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl}$ due to stress symmetry, and $C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$ due to strain symmetry) and major symmetry ($C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$ due to the existence of a strain energy density function).",
        "Step 5: After applying all these fundamental symmetries, the number of independent elastic constants for a general anisotropic (triclinic) material is reduced to 21.",
