      "reasoning": "The wing lift curve slope (a_wing) is defined as the change in lift coefficient per degree angle of attack. For a symmetric airfoil in the linear range, the lift curve passes through (0,0). Using the given data: Lift L = 35.3 N, air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m³, velocity V = 20 m/s, wing area S = chord * span = 0.2 m * 1.2 m = 0.24 m², angle of attack α = 8°. First, compute the lift coefficient: C_L = L / (0.5 * ρ * V² * S). Substituting yields C_L ≈ 0.6003. Then a_wing = C_L / α ≈ 0.6003 / 8 = 0.07504 per degree. This matches option C (0.075 per deg). The airfoil lift slope (0.1 per deg) is a distractor; the finite wing's slope is lower due to downwash effects."

Experimental data for the wing: angle of attack α = 8°, lift L = 35.3 N. The airfoil's 2D lift curve slope is given as 0.1 per degree, but for this direct method, we will use the wing's experimental data.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the wing area (S) and dynamic pressure (q). Wing area S = b * c = 1.2 m * 0.2 m = 0.24 m². Dynamic pressure q = 0.5 * ρ * V² = 0.5 * 1.225 kg/m³ * (20 m/s)² = 245 N/m².",
        "Step 3: Compute the lift coefficient (C_L) for the wing using the given lift, dynamic pressure, and wing area. C_L = L / (q * S) = 35.3 N / (245 N/m² * 0.24 m²) = 35.3 / 58.8 ≈ 0.60034.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the wing's lift curve slope (a_wing). For a symmetric airfoil, the lift at zero angle of attack is zero. Assuming a linear lift curve, the wing lift curve slope is a_wing = C_L / α. Convert the angle of attack to degrees for consistency with the desired output unit: a_wing = 0.60034 / 8° ≈ 0.07504 per degree.",

Then use a = a0_rad / [1 + (a0_rad/(π AR)) (1+τ)], convert back to per degree. This yields a ≈ 0.076/deg, close to the experimental 0.075/deg.",
