Therefore, `SM = -(-0.1) = 0.1`.\n\nThe static margin is also defined as `SM = \\bar{X}_{NP} - \\bar{X}_{CG}` (for non-dimensional quantities).\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n`0.1 = \\bar{X}_{NP} - 0.3`\n\nSolving for `\\bar{X}_{NP}`:\n`\\bar{X}_{NP} = 0.3 + 0.1`\n`\\bar{X}_{NP} = 0.4`\n\nThus, the center of gravity location where `d\\delta_e/dC_L = 0` (i.e., the neutral point) is `0.4 \\bar{c}`.

        "industry_example": "The Boeing 737 is designed to have a positive static margin of around 5-10% of the mean aerodynamic chord, ensuring stable and predictable handling characteristics throughout the flight envelope.",
        "why_it_matters": "Incorrect positioning of the aircraft's center of gravity can lead to longitudinal instability, which is unacceptable for passenger and cargo transport. Proper static stability ensures the aircraft naturally returns to a trimmed condition after disturbances."

      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, try to eliminate obviously incorrect options by applying your understanding of the underlying principles. Recall that the neutral point is usually around 0.3-0.5 of the mean aerodynamic chord for conventional aircraft. For stable flight, the CG must be ahead of the neutral point.",

Differentiate with respect to C_L to obtain d\\delta_e/dC_L in terms of dC_m/dC_L and C_{m_{\\delta_e}}. Then set d\\delta_e/dC_L = 0 and find the condition on dC_m/dC_L, which leads to the neutral point condition.",
