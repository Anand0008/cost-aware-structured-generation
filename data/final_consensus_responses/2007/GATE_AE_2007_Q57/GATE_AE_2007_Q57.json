      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the drag on an airfoil using the integral momentum equation for a control volume. Given the conditions of steady, incompressible, two-dimensional flow, and crucially, that 'The pressure is $p_{\\infty}$ over the entire surface of the control volume', the appropriate form of the drag equation (per unit span) is based on the momentum deficit.\n\nFirst, apply the x-component of the steady-state integral momentum equation to the control volume. Since the pressure is uniform ($p_{\\infty}$) over the entire control volume surface, the net pressure force on the control volume is zero. Thus, the drag force D (per unit span) is solely due to the change in momentum flux:\n\n$D = \\int \\rho u (U_{\\infty} - u) dy$\n\nHere, $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity, $u$ is the velocity in the wake, and $\\rho$ is the fluid density. The integration is performed over the height of the control volume, from $-h$ to $h$.\n\nThe velocity profile in the wake, as interpreted from the figure, is:\n$u(y) = U_{\\infty} - \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{h}y = U_{\\infty} (1 - \\frac{y}{h})$ for $0 \\le y \\le h$\n$u(y) = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{h}y = U_{\\infty} (1 + \\frac{y}{h})$ for $-h \\le y \\le 0$\nThis can be compactly written as $u(y) = U_{\\infty} (1 - \\frac{|y|}{h})$.\n\nSubstitute this into the drag equation:\n$D = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} U_{\\infty} (1 - \\frac{|y|}{h}) [U_{\\infty} - U_{\\infty} (1 - \\frac{|y|}{h})] dy$\n$D = \\rho \\int_{-h}^{h} U_{\\infty} (1 - \\frac{|y|}{h}) [U_{\\infty} \\frac{|y|}{h}] dy$\n$D = \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 \\int_{-h}^{h} (\\frac{|y|}{h} - \\frac{y^2}{h^2}) dy$\n\nDue to the symmetry of the velocity profile and the integration limits, we can integrate from $0$ to $h$ and multiply by 2:\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 \\int_{0}^{h} (\\frac{y}{h} - \\frac{y^2}{h^2}) dy$\n\nNow, perform the integration:\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 [\\frac{1}{h} \\frac{y^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{h^2} \\frac{y^3}{3}]_0^h$\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 [(\\frac{h^2}{2h} - \\frac{h^3}{3h^2}) - (0)]$\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 [\\frac{h}{2} - \\frac{h}{3}]$\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 [\\frac{3h - 2h}{6}]$\n$D = 2\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 [\\frac{h}{6}]$\n$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 h$\n\nThis result matches option A."

Quickly sketch the control volume, identify key assumptions (uniform pressure implies zero net pressure force), and check for symmetry to simplify integration.",

Eliminate options with wrong scaling or those that are physically unlikely (e.g., zero drag for a body in flow). If options differ by simple factors, it might indicate a common integration or factor mistake. Consider plugging in options to see which one matches a simplified momentum equation result.",
