      "reasoning": "The question asks why a turbulent boundary layer remains attached longer than a laminar boundary layer on an airfoil's upper surface. This phenomenon is directly related to the ability of the boundary layer to overcome an adverse pressure gradient (where pressure increases in the direction of flow, dp/dx > 0), which typically occurs towards the rear of the airfoil.\n\nTurbulent boundary layers are characterized by chaotic, irregular motion and energetic mixing. This mixing transports high-energy fluid from the outer layers of the boundary layer closer to the surface. As a result, the velocity profile of a turbulent boundary layer is 'fuller,' meaning the fluid particles near the surface have higher kinetic energy and momentum compared to those in a laminar boundary layer. This increased momentum allows the turbulent boundary layer to better resist the increasing pressure (adverse pressure gradient) that tends to slow down the flow and cause separation. Therefore, a turbulent boundary layer is more resistant to separation and can remain attached over a longer distance.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   **A. the turbulent boundary layer is more energetic and hence can overcome the adverse pressure gradient better**: This statement is consistent with boundary layer theory. Turbulent mixing energizes the fluid near the wall, providing it with sufficient momentum to push against the adverse pressure gradient and delay separation.\n*   **B. the laminar boundary layer develops more skin friction and hence slows down more rapidly**: This is incorrect. Laminar boundary layers generally have *less* skin friction than turbulent boundary layers. While they do slow down rapidly in an adverse pressure gradient, it's due to their lower kinetic energy near the wall, not higher skin friction.\n*   **C. turbulence causes the effective coefficient of viscosity to reduce, resulting in less loss of momentum in the boundary layer**: This is incorrect. Turbulence effectively *increases* the momentum transfer (and thus the effective viscosity, often called eddy viscosity) within the fluid, leading to *higher* skin friction, not a reduction in viscosity or less loss of momentum in the sense of resisting separation.\n*   **D. the turbulent boundary layer is thicker, hence the velocity gradients in it are smaller, therefore viscous losses are less**: While turbulent boundary layers are generally thicker, the velocity gradient *at the wall* ($\\partial V / \\partial n$) is actually much steeper in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one, leading to *higher* skin friction drag (viscous losses) at the surface. The resistance to separation is due to the fuller profile and higher momentum, not reduced viscous losses."
