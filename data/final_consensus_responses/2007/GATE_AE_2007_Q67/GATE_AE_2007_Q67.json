      "reasoning": "The problem describes an aerospace system where an expansion fan is generated at corner A and interacts with 'wall B'. The design condition is when the expansion is 'completely absorbed' by wall B for p₁ = p_d. The crucial point is to correctly identify 'wall B' as a solid boundary, not a free boundary.\n\nIn supersonic flow, the rules for wave reflection are:\n1.  **Reflection from a solid wall**: The flow must remain tangent to the wall. An incident expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave (same wave family) to turn the flow back parallel to the wall. An incident compression wave reflects as a compression wave.\n2.  **Reflection from a free boundary (constant pressure)**: The boundary pressure must remain equal to the ambient. An incident expansion (which lowers pressure) reflects as a compression to bring pressure back up. An incident compression reflects as an expansion.\n\nSince B is a **solid wall**, an incident expansion fan will always reflect as an **expansion fan**, regardless of the upstream pressure conditions (p₁ > p_d or p₁ < p_d).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A. For p₁ < p_d, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as a compression wave.** This statement contradicts the solid-wall reflection rule. An expansion wave reflecting from a solid wall must reflect as an expansion wave. Therefore, this statement is **NOT true**.\n*   **B. For p₁ > p_d, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.** This is consistent with the solid-wall reflection rule, so this statement is true.\n*   **C. For p₁ < p_d, the expansion fan from A gets reflected from B as an expansion wave.** This is also consistent with the solid-wall reflection rule, so this statement is true.\n*   **D. For p₁ > p_d, B always sees an expansion.** The wave generated at A is an expansion, and it propagates towards B. Thus, B is always impinged upon by an expansion wave. This statement is true.\n\nSince the question asks for the statement that is NOT true, option A is the correct answer."

        "Step 1: Understand the problem setup. An expansion fan is generated at point A and interacts with 'wall B'. The design condition is p₁ = p_d, where the expansion is 'completely absorbed' by wall B.",

        "Step 4: Apply this rule to the given options. Option A states that for p₁ < p_d, the expansion fan from A reflects from B as a compression wave. This contradicts the solid wall reflection rule. Therefore, statement A is NOT true.",
        "Step 5: Determine the type of reflected wave from the solid wall B. According to the solid-wall reflection rule, an incident expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave to ensure the flow remains parallel to the wall. Evaluate each option based on this principle.",

        "Step 7: Evaluate Options B and C: Both state that the expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave. This is consistent with the solid-wall reflection rule. Thus, these statements are TRUE.",
        "Step 8: Evaluate Option D: It states that wall B always encounters an expansion. Since A generates an expansion, and the reflection is also an expansion, wall B will always be exposed to an expansion wave. Thus, this statement is TRUE.",
        "Step 9: Conclude that since options B, C, and D are true, option A is the only statement that is NOT true, making it the correct answer."
