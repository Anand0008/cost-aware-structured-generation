Therefore, the excess power available at the propeller is related to the excess Brake Power from the engine by $P_{\\text{excess, A}} = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$.",
        "Combine the relationships from the previous steps. Since $P_{\\text{excess, A}} = W \\cdot RC$ and $P_{\\text{excess, A}} = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$, we can equate them: $W \\cdot RC = \\eta_P \\cdot P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$.",
        "Rearrange the combined equation to solve for the desired quantity, the excess Brake Power ($P_{\\text{excess, BP}}$): $P_{\\text{excess, BP}} = \\frac{W \\cdot RC}{\\eta_P}$.",
