This relationship is derived from the Blasius solution, where $\\delta = \\frac{5.0x}{\\sqrt{\\text{Re}_x}}$ and $\\text{Re}_x = \\frac{\\rho V x}{\\mu}$. Substituting $\\text{Re}_x$ into the $\\delta$ formula shows that $\\delta \\propto \\sqrt{x}$.\nGiven:\n$\\delta_1 = 5 \\text{ mm}$ at $x_1 = 0.2 \\text{ m}$\nWe need to find $\\delta_2$ at $x_2 = 0.8 \\text{ m}$.\nUsing the proportionality:\n$\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}}$\n$\\delta_2 = \\delta_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8 \\text{ m}}{0.2 \\text{ m}}} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\sqrt{4} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ mm}$"

        "Recall the governing principle for a laminar, incompressible boundary layer on a flat plate with zero pressure gradient: the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ grows proportionally to the square root of the distance from the leading edge, $x$.",

Substituting $\\text{Re}_x$ shows $\\delta = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty x}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty}}$. Since freestream conditions are constant, the term $5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\rho_\\infty V_\\infty}}$ is a constant, thus $\\delta \\propto \\sqrt{x}$.",
