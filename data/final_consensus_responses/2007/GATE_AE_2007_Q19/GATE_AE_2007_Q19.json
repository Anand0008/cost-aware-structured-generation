      "reasoning": "The Joukowski airfoil is studied in aerodynamics primarily because it can be easily transformed into a circle mathematically. The Joukowski transformation is a conformal mapping that transforms a simple circle in the complex plane into an airfoil shape. This mathematical tractability is crucial because analyzing incompressible, inviscid fluid flow over a circular cylinder is an analytically solvable problem in potential flow theory. By mapping the airfoil to a circle, the complex flow problem around the airfoil can be solved by first solving the simpler flow problem around the circle and then mapping the solution back. Therefore, the ease of mathematically transforming an airfoil into a circle (and vice-versa) is the fundamental reason for studying Joukowski airfoils. Option B accurately reflects this. Option A is incorrect because Joukowski airfoils, characterized by a cusped trailing edge, are generally not used in modern aircraft due to practical manufacturing difficulties and suboptimal aerodynamic performance. Option C is misleading; while the generating circle is simple, the primary reason for study is the mathematical tractability of the transformation, not just the geometry itself. Option D is incorrect; Joukowski airfoils do not inherently possess the highest lift curve slope among all airfoils."
