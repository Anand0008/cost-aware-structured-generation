      "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is the freestream Mach number at which the local Mach number at some point on the airfoil surface first reaches Mach 1. For high-speed subsonic airplanes, a high $M_{cr}$ is desirable to delay the onset of compressibility effects and wave drag. Thinner airfoils cause less acceleration of the airflow over their surfaces compared to thicker airfoils. This results in a less negative pressure coefficient and a lower local Mach number for a given freestream Mach number. Consequently, a higher freestream Mach number is required for the local flow on a thin airfoil to reach sonic speed, leading to a higher critical Mach number. Therefore, high-speed subsonic airplanes are designed with thin airfoils to maximize their critical Mach number and allow for efficient flight at higher speeds before significant drag rise occurs."

        "Analyze the effect of airfoil thickness on local flow acceleration. A thicker airfoil creates a larger disturbance and greater acceleration of the airflow over its curved surfaces. This leads to a more negative pressure coefficient ($C_p$) at the point of maximum velocity.",
        "Relate local flow acceleration to $M_{cr}$. Due to greater flow acceleration, a thicker airfoil will reach $M_{local}=1$ at a lower freestream Mach number compared to a thinner airfoil. Conversely, a thinner airfoil causes less flow acceleration, meaning it requires a higher freestream Mach number for the local flow to become sonic.",
        "Conclude the optimal design choice. To achieve a high critical Mach number, which is desired for high-speed subsonic flight, airfoils should be designed to be thin. This delays the formation of local supersonic regions and the associated drag rise.",

A thicker airfoil creates a larger disturbance in the flow, causing greater acceleration over the top surface, resulting in a lower (more negative) incompressible pressure coefficient, Cp,0, and thus a lower Mcr. Conversely, a thinner airfoil causes less flow perturbation, its Cp,0 is less negative, leading to a higher Mcr.
