      "reasoning": "Across a normal shock wave, the flow process is adiabatic and involves no shaft work. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics (energy conservation), the total enthalpy (h₀) remains constant. For a calorically perfect gas, total temperature (T₀) is directly proportional to h₀, thus T₀ remains constant (T₀,₁ = T₀,₂). However, a normal shock is an irreversible process due to viscous dissipation and thermal conduction within its very thin structure. This irreversibility leads to an increase in entropy (Δs > 0) across the shock, as dictated by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. An increase in entropy across a shock is directly linked to a decrease in the total pressure (p₀), which represents a loss in the useful work potential of the flow (p₀,₂ < p₀,₁). Therefore, total temperature remains constant, but total pressure decreases, which corresponds to option D."
