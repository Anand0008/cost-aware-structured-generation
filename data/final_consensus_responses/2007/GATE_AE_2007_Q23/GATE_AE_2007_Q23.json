The solution involves calculating the spring stiffness (k) from the static deflection, then determining the natural frequency (ωn), and finally applying the given initial conditions (initial displacement and zero initial velocity) to the general solution of undamped free vibration.\n\n1.  **Calculate spring stiffness (k):**\n    Given: mass $m = 1 \\text{ kg}$, static elongation $\\Delta x_{st} = 16 \\text{ mm} = 0.016 \\text{ m}$, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n    At static equilibrium, the spring force balances the gravitational force:\n    $k \\Delta x_{st} = m g$\n    $k = \\frac{m g}{\\Delta x_{st}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}{0.016 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{9.81}{0.016} = 613.125 \\text{ N/m}$\n\n2.  **Calculate natural circular frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    For an undamped spring-mass system, the natural frequency is:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{613.125 \\text{ N/m}}{1 \\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{613.125} \\approx 24.7614 \\text{ rad/s}$\n\n3.  **Determine initial conditions:**\n    The mass is pulled from its equilibrium position by $10 \\text{ mm}$ and released from rest.\n    Initial displacement: $x(0) = 10 \\text{ mm}$\n    Initial velocity: $\\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\text{ mm/s}$\n\n4.  **General solution for undamped free vibration:**\n    The general solution for $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$ is $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega_n t) + B \\sin(\\omega_n t)$.\n\n5.  **Apply initial conditions to find A and B:**\n    *   At $t=0$, $x(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A$. Since $x(0) = 10 \\text{ mm}$, we get $A = 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n    *   Differentiate $x(t)$ to find velocity: $\\dot{x}(t) = -A\\omega_n \\sin(\\omega_n t) + B\\omega_n \\cos(\\omega_n t)$.\n    *   At $t=0$, $\\dot{x}(0) = -A\\omega_n \\sin(0) + B\\omega_n \\cos(0) = B\\omega_n$. Since $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$, we have $B\\omega_n = 0$. As $\\omega_n \\neq 0$, it implies $B = 0$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final response:**\n    Substitute $A = 10 \\text{ mm}$, $B = 0$, and $\\omega_n \\approx 24.76 \\text{ rad/s}$ into the general solution:\n    $x(t) = 10 \\cos(24.76 t) \\text{ mm}$\n\nThis matches option B."
