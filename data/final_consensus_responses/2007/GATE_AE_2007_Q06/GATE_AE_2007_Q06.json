      "reasoning": "The number of natural frequencies of an elastic beam with cantilever boundary conditions is infinite. This is because an elastic beam, modeled as a continuous system (e.g., using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory), has an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The vibration analysis leads to a transcendental frequency equation (e.g., $1 + \\cos(\\beta L) \\cosh(\\beta L) = 0$), which has an infinite number of roots (solutions). Each root corresponds to a distinct natural frequency and mode shape. This is a fundamental concept in the vibration of continuous systems."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "An elastic beam is a continuous, distributed parameter system, meaning its mass and stiffness are distributed along its length, unlike a lumped-mass (discrete) system.",
        "The transverse vibration of a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam is described by a fourth-order partial differential equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left(EI\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}\\right) + \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} = 0$.",
        "Applying separation of variables with a harmonic solution $w(x,t) = \\phi(x) e^{i\\omega t}$ leads to an ordinary differential equation for the mode shape $\\phi(x)$: $\\frac{d^4 \\phi}{dx^4} - \\beta^4 \\phi = 0$, where $\\beta^4 = \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{EI}$.",
        "Applying appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., fixed at x=0, free at x=L for a cantilever beam) to the general solution of the mode shape equation leads to a homogeneous system of equations.",
        "For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero, which results in a transcendental characteristic equation (frequency equation) for the cantilever beam: $1 + \\cos(\\beta L)\\cosh(\\beta L) = 0$. This equation involves trigonometric and hyperbolic functions of the eigenvalue parameter $\\beta L$.",
        "A transcendental equation like this possesses an infinite, countably infinite, number of solutions (roots) for $\\beta L$. Each root $\\beta_n L$ corresponds to a unique eigenvalue $\\beta_n$, which in turn determines a distinct natural frequency $\\omega_n = (\\beta_n)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$.",
        "Therefore, because there are infinitely many roots to the transcendental frequency equation, a continuous elastic beam (regardless of its boundary conditions) possesses an infinite number of natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes."
