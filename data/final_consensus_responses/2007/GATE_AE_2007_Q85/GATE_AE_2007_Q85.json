      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the overall compressor isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) from its polytropic efficiency ($\\eta_{pc}$) and pressure ratio ($r_c$). First, calculate the compressor pressure ratio: $r_c = P_{t3} / P_{t2} = 3.15 \\text{ MPa} / 0.9 \\text{ MPa} = 3.5$. The standard formula relating isentropic efficiency to polytropic efficiency for a compressor is: $\\eta_c = \\frac{{r_c^{{\\frac{{\\gamma-1}}{{\\gamma}}}} - 1}}{{r_c^{{\\frac{{\\gamma-1}}{{\\gamma \\eta_{{pc}}}}}} - 1}}$. Using the given values: $r_c = 3.5$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, and $\\eta_{pc} = 0.89$. Plugging these values into the formula: $\\eta_c = \\left[(3.5)^{(1.4-1)/1.4} - 1\\right] / \\left[(3.5)^{(1.4-1)/(1.4\\times0.89)} - 1\\right] \\approx 0.869$. This value matches option B. It is also physically consistent, as for compressors, the overall isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) should be less than the polytropic efficiency ($\\eta_{pc}$), and $0.869 < 0.89$."
