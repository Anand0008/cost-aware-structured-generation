      "reasoning": "Stall occurs when the local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) at any point on the wing exceeds its maximum possible value ($c_{l,max}$) for that specific airfoil section. For a designer who prefers stall to begin at the wing root ($y/s = 0$), the root section must be the first to reach its $c_{l,max}$ as the wing's angle of attack (and consequently, the overall wing lift coefficient $C_L$) increases. This implies that, for a given $C_L$, the local $c_l$ at the root must be proportionally higher compared to other sections along the span.\n\nThe provided figure plots the ratio $c_l / C_L$ against the normalized spanwise coordinate $y/s$. A higher value of $c_l / C_L$ at a particular spanwise location indicates that this section is operating at a relatively higher local lift coefficient compared to the overall wing lift. Therefore, the section with the highest $c_l / C_L$ ratio at the root ($y/s = 0$) will be the first to reach its $c_{l,max}$ and initiate stall.\n\nLet's analyze the values at $y/s = 0$ from the graph:\n*   For curve P: $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.8$\n*   For curve Q: $c_l / C_L \\approx 0.9$\n*   For curve R: $c_l / C_L \\approx 1.1$\n\nCurve R exhibits the highest value of $c_l / C_L$ at the wing root ($y/s = 0$). This means that for wing R, the root section is generating a proportionally higher lift compared to the overall wing lift. Consequently, as the angle of attack increases, the root section of wing R will reach its critical lift coefficient ($c_{l,max}$) before any other section, causing stall to begin at the root. This is a desirable characteristic in aircraft design for maintaining control and stability during stall."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the design objective and the condition for stall. The designer prefers stall to begin at the wing root ($y/s = 0$). Stall at any wing section occurs when its local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) reaches the maximum lift coefficient ($c_{l,max}$ or $c_{l,stall}$) for that airfoil section.",
        "Analyze the given span-wise lift distributions (P, Q, and R). The graph plots the ratio of local section lift coefficient ($c_l$) to the total wing lift coefficient ($C_L$) against the normalized span coordinate ($y/s$). This ratio indicates how heavily each spanwise station is loaded relative to the wing average.",
        "For stall to begin at the root, the root section must be the first part of the wing to reach its maximum local section lift coefficient ($c_{l,max}$) as the overall wing lift coefficient ($C_L$) increases. This means the root section must have the highest $c_l/C_L$ ratio compared to other sections along the span.",
        "To ensure stall begins at the root and progresses outwards, preserving aileron effectiveness, the wing's lift distribution must have the largest $c_l/C_L$ ratio at the root ($y/s = 0$) and decrease towards the tips.",
        "Inspect the provided curves:\n*   For curve P, the maximum $c_l/C_L$ occurs away from the root (mid-span). At $y/s = 0$, $c_l/C_L \\approx 0.8$.\n*   For curve Q, the $c_l/C_L$ is relatively uniform or peaks slightly inboard. At $y/s = 0$, $c_l/C_L \\approx 0.9$.\n*   For curve R, the $c_l/C_L$ is maximum at the root ($y/s = 0$) with a value of approximately $1.1$ and decreases towards the tip.",
        "Based on the analysis, Wing R has the highest $c_l/C_L$ value at the root ($y/s = 0$). This indicates that its root section will reach $c_{l,max}$ first as the angle of attack increases, causing stall to initiate at the root. This matches the designer's objective, making Wing R the preferred choice."

      "Aerospace Design": "Wing design involves balancing aerodynamic efficiency (e.g., minimizing induced drag with elliptical-like distributions) with safety considerations like desirable stall characteristics.",
      "Aircraft Design": "Wing planform and twist are chosen to achieve desired lift distribution and stall behavior.",
      "Control Systems": "Loss of aileron effectiveness due to tip stall can be mitigated by control system design and envelope protection logic.",
