      "reasoning": "The question asks about the changes across an oblique shock wave in a calorically perfect gas. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. the stagnation enthalpy changes:**\nFor an adiabatic flow across a shock wave (both normal and oblique), the total enthalpy (or stagnation enthalpy, $h_0$) remains constant. For a calorically perfect gas, this implies that the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) also remains constant. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B. the stagnation entropy changes:**\nShock waves are inherently irreversible processes due to viscous dissipation and thermal conduction. According to the second law of thermodynamics, any irreversible adiabatic process leads to an increase in entropy. This increase in entropy is directly linked to a loss of stagnation pressure. Therefore, stagnation entropy changes (increases) across an oblique shock. This option is correct.\n\n**C. the stagnation temperature changes:**\nAs explained for option A, for an adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas, the total enthalpy and thus the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remain constant across a shock wave. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**D. the speed of sound changes:**\nThe speed of sound ($a$) for a calorically perfect gas is given by $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, where $T$ is the static temperature. Across a shock wave, the flow is compressed and heated, meaning the static temperature ($T$) increases from upstream to downstream. Since the speed of sound is directly dependent on the static temperature, an increase in static temperature will lead to an increase in the speed of sound. Therefore, the speed of sound changes across an oblique shock. This option is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, options B and D are correct."
