      "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the maximum bending moment at the fixed support P for two different beam configurations and then calculating the ratio of the corresponding maximum bending stresses.\n\n**1. Bending Stress Formula:**\nThe maximum bending stress $\\sigma_{max}$ at a point is given by $\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M y_{max}}{I}$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $y_{max}$ is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the cross-section. Since the beam has a rectangular cross-section and is constant, $y_{max}$ and $I$ are the same for both cases. Therefore, the ratio of maximum bending stresses will be equal to the ratio of the magnitudes of the maximum bending moments at P.\n\n**2. Case I: Cantilever with mid-point load F**\n*   The beam is fixed at P and free at Q. A load $F$ is applied at R, which is at a distance $l$ from P. The total length of the beam is $2l$.\n*   The maximum bending moment occurs at the fixed support P.\n*   $M_{P,I} = F \\times l$ (magnitude).\n\n**3. Case II: Propped Cantilever with mid-point load F**\n*   The beam is fixed at P and simply supported at Q. A load $F$ is applied at R, at a distance $l$ from P. The total length of the beam is $2l$. This is a statically indeterminate beam.\n*   To solve for the reactions, we use the superposition method:\n    *   **Step 3.1: Deflection at Q due to load F (treating as a simple cantilever fixed at P, free at Q).**\n        The deflection at Q (distance $2l$ from P) due to load $F$ at R (distance $l$ from P) is calculated using the cantilever deflection formula for a load not at the tip. For a cantilever with a point load $P$ at distance $a$ from the fixed end, the deflection at a distance $x > a$ is given by $\\delta_x = \\frac{P a^2}{6EI} (3x - a)$.\n        Here, $P=F$, $a=l$, and $x=2l$.\n        $\\delta_{Q,F} = \\frac{F l^2}{6EI} (3(2l) - l) = \\frac{F l^2}{6EI} (5l) = \\frac{5F l^3}{6EI}$.\n    *   **Step 3.2: Upward deflection at Q due to reaction $R_Q$ (treating as a simple cantilever fixed at P, with an upward tip load $R_Q$ at Q).**\n        The upward deflection at Q due to $R_Q$ is given by the standard tip-loaded cantilever formula, where the load is $R_Q$ and the length is $2l$.\n        $\\delta_{Q,R_Q} = \\frac{R_Q (2l)^3}{3EI} = \\frac{8 R_Q l^3}{3EI}$.\n    *   **Step 3.3: Compatibility Condition.**\n        Since Q is simply supported, the net deflection at Q must be zero.\n        $\\delta_{Q,F} - \\delta_{Q,R_Q} = 0$\n        $\\frac{5F l^3}{6EI} - \\frac{8 R_Q l^3}{3EI} = 0$\n        $\\frac{5F}{6} = \\frac{8 R_Q}{3}$\n        $R_Q = \\frac{5F}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{15F}{48} = \\frac{5F}{16}$.\n    *   **Step 3.4: Maximum Bending Moment at P for Case II.**\n        Sum moments about P (fixed end) considering the external load $F$ and the reaction $R_Q$.\n        $M_{P,II} + F \\times l - R_Q \\times (2l) = 0$\n        $M_{P,II} = R_Q \\times (2l) - F \\times l$\n        $M_{P,II} = \\frac{5F}{16} \\times (2l) - F \\times l = \\frac{10F l}{16} - F l = \\frac{5F l}{8} - F l = \\frac{5F l - 8F l}{8} = -\\frac{3F l}{8}$.\n        The magnitude of the maximum bending moment at P is $\\frac{3F l}{8}$.\n\n**4. Ratio of Maximum Bending Stresses**\n$\\frac{\\sigma_{P,I}}{\\sigma_{P,II}} = \\frac{M_{P,I} (y_{max}/I)}{M_{P,II} (y_{max}/I)} = \\frac{M_{P,I}}{M_{P,II}}$\n$\\frac{\\sigma_{P,I}}{\\sigma_{P,II}} = \\frac{F l}{3F l / 8} = \\frac{1}{3/8} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n$\\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666...$\nRounded off to one decimal place, the ratio is $2.7$."

        "Understand the problem: We need the ratio of maximum bending stress at the fixed support P in two beam configurations (Case I: cantilever, Case II: propped cantilever) under the same mid-point load F. Since the cross-section is the same for both cases, the maximum bending stress at P is proportional to the bending moment at P ($\\sigma_{max} = M_{max} / Z$). Thus, the required stress ratio equals the bending moment ratio $M_{P,I} / M_{P,II}$. The total beam length is $2l$, and the load F is at mid-span, which is a distance $l$ from P.",
        "Analyze Case I (Cantilever): The beam PQ is fixed at P and free at Q, with a point load F at R (mid-span, distance $l$ from P). The maximum bending moment occurs at the fixed end P. Calculate $M_{P,I} = F \\times l$.",
        "Analyze Case II (Propped Cantilever): The beam PQ is fixed at P and simply supported at Q, with a point load F at R (mid-span, distance $l$ from P). This is a statically indeterminate beam. Use the principle of superposition and the compatibility condition that the vertical deflection at Q is zero.",
        "To find the reaction $R_Q$ at Q, consider an equivalent cantilever beam fixed at P and free at Q (total length $2l$). Calculate the downward deflection at Q ($\\delta_{Q,F}$) due to the load F at distance $l$ from P. Then, calculate the upward deflection at Q ($\\delta_{Q,R_Q}$) due to the unknown reaction $R_Q$ acting as a tip load at Q. The compatibility condition is $\\delta_{Q,F} - \\delta_{Q,R_Q} = 0$.",
        "Using standard cantilever deflection formulas: 1. Deflection at Q (at $x=2l$) due to load F at $x=l$: $\\delta_{Q,F} = \\frac{F l^2}{6EI}(3(2l) - l) = \\frac{5Fl^3}{6EI}$. 2. Deflection at Q (at $x=2l$) due to reaction $R_Q$ at Q: $\\delta_{Q,R_Q} = \\frac{R_Q (2l)^3}{3EI} = \\frac{8 R_Q l^3}{3EI}$. Apply compatibility: $\\frac{5Fl^3}{6EI} - \\frac{8 R_Q l^3}{3EI} = 0 \\Rightarrow R_Q = \\frac{5F}{16}$.",
        "Calculate the fixed-end moment $M_{P,II}$ at P for Case II. Taking moments about P (with $M_{P,II}$ assumed positive counter-clockwise): $M_{P,II} + R_Q (2l) - F l = 0$. Substitute $R_Q = \\frac{5F}{16}$: $M_{P,II} = F l - R_Q (2l) = F l - \\frac{5F}{16} (2l) = F l - \\frac{10Fl}{16} = F l - \\frac{5Fl}{8} = \\frac{3Fl}{8}$.",
