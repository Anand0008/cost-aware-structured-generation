      "reasoning": "The problem states that Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves appear at the nozzle exit, indicating that the nozzle is currently underexpanded (exit static pressure, p_e, is greater than the ambient pressure, p_a). To eliminate these waves, the nozzle must achieve perfect expansion, meaning the static pressure at the nozzle exit must equal the ambient pressure (p_e = p_a = 1 bar). The nozzle is designed for an exit Mach number of 2.3, which is fixed by its geometry for isentropic flow.\n\nWe use the isentropic pressure relation:\np_0 / p_e = (1 + (γ - 1)/2 * M_e^2)^(γ / (γ - 1))\n\nGiven:\nM_e = 2.3\nγ = 1.4\np_a = 1 bar (which will be p_e for perfect expansion)\n\nCalculate the required reservoir pressure (p_0,new) for perfect expansion:\np_0,new / 1 = (1 + (1.4 - 1)/2 * 2.3^2)^(1.4 / (1.4 - 1))\np_0,new = (1 + 0.2 * 2.3^2)^3.5\np_0,new = (1 + 0.2 * 5.29)^3.5\np_0,new = (1 + 1.058)^3.5\np_0,new = (2.058)^3.5\np_0,new ≈ 12.10 bar\n\nThe initial reservoir pressure (p_0,initial) is given as 25 bar.\nThe percentage change in reservoir pressure is:\n% change = ((p_0,new - p_0,initial) / p_0,initial) * 100\n% change = ((12.10 - 25) / 25) * 100\n% change = (-12.90 / 25) * 100\n% change = -51.6%\n\nThe minimum percentage change required to eliminate the wave system is approximately 51.6%. The question asks for the magnitude or allows for a range, so 49-51% or -51 to -49% is acceptable. The negative sign indicates a reduction in reservoir pressure."

The objective is to eliminate Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves, which requires the nozzle to be perfectly expanded, meaning the static pressure at the nozzle exit (pe) must equal the ambient pressure (p_ambient). From the problem context, we infer p_ambient = 1 bar, so the required exit static pressure (pe_req) = 1 bar.",
        "Recognize that for a fixed nozzle geometry, if the flow is choked and supersonic at the exit, the exit Mach number (Me) is determined by the area ratio and remains constant as long as the flow remains isentropic and choked. Therefore, Me = 2.3 will be maintained for the perfectly expanded condition.",
