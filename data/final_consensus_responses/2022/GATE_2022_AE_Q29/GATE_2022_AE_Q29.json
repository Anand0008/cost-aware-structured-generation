      "reasoning": "The question asks about the conditions that an isotropic linear elastic material point under plane strain in the x-y plane always obeys. Let's analyze each option based on the definition of plane strain and generalized Hooke's Law:\n\n1.  **Plane Strain Definition:** A state of plane strain in the x-y plane means that there is no deformation (strain) in the z-direction, and no shear deformation involving the z-direction. Therefore, the defining strain components that are zero are:\n    *   Normal strain: `$\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$`\n    *   Shear strains: `$\\gamma_{xz} = 0$` and `$\\gamma_{yz} = 0$`\n\n2.  **Evaluating Options based on Strain Definitions:**\n    *   **A. out-of-plane normal strain, `$\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$`**: This is a direct definition of plane strain. Thus, Option A is **correct**.\n    *   **D. out-of-plane shear strain, `$\\gamma_{xz} = 0$`**: This is also a direct definition of plane strain (along with `$\\gamma_{yz} = 0$`). Thus, Option D is **correct**.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Options based on Stress-Strain Relationships (Generalized Hooke's Law):** For an isotropic linear elastic material, stress and strain are related by Hooke's Law.\n    *   **For Shear Stresses:** `$\\tau_{ij} = G \\gamma_{ij}$`, where `G` is the shear modulus.\n        *   Since `$\\gamma_{xz} = 0$` (from plane strain definition), then `$\\tau_{xz} = G \\times 0 = 0$`.\n        *   Similarly, since `$\\gamma_{yz} = 0$`, then `$\\tau_{yz} = G \\times 0 = 0$`.\n    *   **C. out-of-plane shear stress, `$\\tau_{xz} = 0$`**: Based on Hooke's Law for shear and the plane strain condition `$\\gamma_{xz} = 0$`, this is **correct**.\n\n    *   **For Normal Stresses:** The generalized Hooke's Law for normal strain in the z-direction is `$\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})]$`, where `E` is Young's Modulus and `$\\nu$` is Poisson's ratio.\n        *   Since `$\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$` in plane strain, the equation becomes `$\\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})] = 0$`.\n        *   This implies `$\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = 0$`, or `$\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$`.\n    *   **B. out-of-plane normal stress, `$\\sigma_{zz} = 0$`**: As derived, `$\\sigma_{zz}$` is generally non-zero and depends on the in-plane normal stresses `$\\sigma_{xx}$`, `$\\sigma_{yy}$`, and Poisson's ratio `$\\nu$`. It is only zero if `$\\nu = 0$` or `$(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = 0$`, which are not universally true for all plane strain conditions. Thus, Option B is **incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A, C, and D."

        "Apply the Generalized Hooke's Law for normal strain in the z-direction: `$\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})]$`.",

This expression for `$\\sigma_{zz}$` is generally non-zero unless Poisson's ratio `$\\nu$` is zero or the sum of in-plane normal stresses `$(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$` is zero. Thus, `$\\sigma_{zz}$` is not always zero in plane strain. Therefore, Option B is incorrect."
