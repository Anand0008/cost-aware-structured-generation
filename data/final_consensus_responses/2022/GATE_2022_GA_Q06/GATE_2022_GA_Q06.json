      "reasoning": "The passage explicitly states two advantages of ultra-black skin for species S: 'helps them not only to avoid predators but also sneakily attack their prey.' It also explicitly states a disadvantage: 'However, having this extra layer of black pigment results in lower collagen on their skin, making their skin more fragile.' Therefore, having ultra-black skin has both advantages and disadvantages to species S. Option C accurately and comprehensively reflects all the information provided in the passage. Options A and D are incorrect as they claim 'only' advantageous or disadvantageous, which contradicts the passage. Option B is incorrect because it incorrectly links lower collagen (a disadvantage) as the reason for avoiding predators; the advantage comes from the black pigment, not the lower collagen."

        "Based on the identified advantages and disadvantages, evaluate each given option.",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'Having ultra-black skin is only advantageous to species S.' This is incorrect, as the passage explicitly mentions a disadvantage (fragile skin).",
        "Evaluate Option B: 'Species S with lower collagen in their skin are at an advantage because it helps them avoid predators.' This is incorrect. Lower collagen leads to fragile skin (a disadvantage), and predator avoidance is an advantage of the ultra-black skin, not the lower collagen.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'Having ultra-black skin has both advantages and disadvantages to species S.' This statement accurately reflects the information in the passage, which describes benefits (predator avoidance, attacking prey) and a drawback (fragile skin due to lower collagen).",
        "Evaluate Option D: 'Having ultra-black skin is only disadvantageous to species S but advantageous only to their predators.' This is incorrect, as the passage clearly states advantages for species S. Conclude that Option C is the correct logical inference based on the complete information provided."
