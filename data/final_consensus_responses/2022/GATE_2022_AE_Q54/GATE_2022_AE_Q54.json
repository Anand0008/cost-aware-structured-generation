The problem involves a thin, symmetric airfoil at a small angle of attack (2 degrees) in a uniform incompressible flow, so thin airfoil theory applies.

      "Flight Mechanics": "Pitching moment coefficients are fundamental for understanding aircraft longitudinal stability and control. The location of the aerodynamic center relative to the center of gravity determines static margin. The calculated pitching moment coefficient about the LE can be transferred to any other point (e.g., the aircraft's CG) using the formula $c_{m,x} = c_{m,le} + c_l (x_{cg}/c)$, which is crucial for longitudinal static stability analysis.",
      "Mathematics": "The derivation involves solving an integral equation (fundamental equation of thin airfoil theory) using Glauert's method, connecting to Fourier series analysis.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The underlying principles of thin airfoil theory are rooted in potential flow theory and vortex dynamics, which are core concepts in fluid mechanics.",
      "Structural Mechanics": "The pitching moment creates bending stresses on the wing structure, which must be accounted for in structural design."
