      "reasoning": "The horizontal tail is the primary contributor to the aircraft's longitudinal static stability. This is characterized by a negative pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack, `C_m_alpha < 0`. When the aircraft's angle of attack increases (nose pitches up), the tail generates a restoring nose-down pitching moment, helping to bring the aircraft back to its equilibrium. Conversely, a decrease in angle of attack generates a nose-up moment. The contribution of the horizontal tail to `C_m_alpha` is given by the formula `Cm_alpha_tail = - eta * V_H * CL_alpha_tail * (1 - d_epsilon/d_alpha)`. Since `eta` (dynamic pressure ratio), `V_H` (tail volume ratio), `CL_alpha_tail` (tail lift curve slope), and `(1 - d_epsilon/d_alpha)` are all typically positive for a conventional aircraft, the `Cm_alpha_tail` will be negative, indicating a stabilizing effect. This confirms that option A is the correct statement."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the concept of longitudinal static stability. An aircraft is longitudinally statically stable if, upon a disturbance that changes its angle of attack, a restoring pitching moment is generated to bring it back to its original trimmed angle of attack.",
        "Identify the parameter for longitudinal static stability: C_m_alpha (dC_m/d\\alpha), the pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack. For positive static stability, C_m_alpha must be negative, meaning an increase in angle of attack generates a nose-down pitching moment, and vice-versa.",
        "Recall the component contributions to the total aircraft C_m_alpha: $C_{m_{\\alpha}} = (C_{m_{\\alpha}})_{wing} + (C_{m_{\\alpha}})_{fuselage} + (C_{m_{\\alpha}})_{tail}$. The wing and fuselage contributions can be destabilizing or weakly stabilizing, but the horizontal tail is specifically designed to provide a significant negative (stabilizing) contribution.",
        "Analyze the horizontal tail's contribution formula: $C_{m_{\\alpha_{tail}}} = -\\eta V_H C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}}(1 - \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\alpha})$. All terms $\\eta$ (dynamic pressure ratio), $V_H$ (tail volume ratio), $C_{L_{\\alpha_{tail}}}$ (tail lift curve slope), and $(1 - d\\epsilon/d\\alpha)$ (wake effect) are typically positive for a conventional aircraft. Therefore, the product is negative, confirming that the horizontal tail provides a negative (stabilizing) contribution to C_m_alpha.",
        "The horizontal tail generates a nose-down moment when the angle of attack increases (due to its position behind the CG and the effect of downwash). This inherently leads to a negative `C_m_alpha` contribution from the tail because the key parameters determining this contribution (tail volume ratio `V_H`, tail lift curve slope `C_L_alpha_tail`, and downwash gradient `d_epsilon/d_alpha`) are all positive quantities.",
        "Therefore, the horizontal tail's `C_m_alpha` contribution is negative, making option A (`C_m_alpha < 0`) the correct statement, as it describes the stabilizing contribution. Options B and C describe neutral and unstable contributions, which are incorrect. Option D incorrectly states `C_m_alpha > 0`."

For a conventional tail, this generates an increased downward lift. This force, acting at a long moment arm behind the CG, creates a large nose-down moment opposing the initial pitch-up. This directly implies d(Moment)/d(alpha) is negative.",
