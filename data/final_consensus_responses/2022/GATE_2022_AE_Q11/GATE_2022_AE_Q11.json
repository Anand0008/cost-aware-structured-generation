      "reasoning": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 at the point (1,1), follow these steps:\n1.  **Find the derivative**: The derivative `dy/dx` gives the slope of the tangent line. For `y = x^2`, `dy/dx = 2x`.\n2.  **Calculate the slope at the point**: Substitute the x-coordinate of the given point (1,1) into the derivative: `m = 2(1) = 2`.\n3.  **Use the point-slope form**: The equation of a straight line passing through `(x_1, y_1)` with slope `m` is `y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)`. Substitute `x_1=1`, `y_1=1`, and `m=2`: `y - 1 = 2(x - 1)`.\nThis equation directly matches option C. While option B, `y = 2x - 1`, is algebraically equivalent (derived by simplifying `y - 1 = 2x - 2` to `y = 2x - 1`), option C is the direct result of applying the point-slope formula, which is a standard way to express a line's equation when a point and slope are known."

      "Numerical Methods": "Tangent lines are used in numerical methods like Newton-Raphson iteration for finding roots of equations, where successive approximations are found by following the tangent to the function.",
      "Physics": "The concept of a tangent line is directly analogous to instantaneous velocity in kinematics. If `r(t)` is the position vector, `dr/dt` is the instantaneous velocity vector, which is tangent to the path.",
      "Vector Calculus": "For 3D curves, the tangent line equation is expressed in vector form `R = r + \\lambda (dr/dt)` or Cartesian symmetric form `(X - x) / (dx/dt) = (Y - y) / (dy/dt) = (Z - z) / (dz/dt)`, as mentioned in the RAG context. This problem is a 2D simplification of this general concept."
