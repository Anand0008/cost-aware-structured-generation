      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the horizontal displacement of point R in a two-member truss. The Unit Load Method (or Virtual Work Method) is the most appropriate approach for this. Both members PR and QR have cross-sectional area $A_0$ and Young's modulus $E$. The vertical distance from the fixed supports (P and Q) to R is $l$, and both members make a $45^\\circ$ angle with the horizontal.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the actual forces ($F_{A,i}$) in each member due to the applied load $F$.**\nDraw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) of joint R. Let $F_{PR}$ be the force in member PR and $F_{QR}$ be the force in member QR. Assume tensile forces are positive.\n\nEquilibrium equations for joint R:\n$\\Sigma F_y = 0$: $F_{PR} \\sin(45^\\circ) + F_{QR} \\sin(45^\\circ) = 0$\nSince $\\sin(45^\\circ) \\neq 0$, this implies $F_{PR} + F_{QR} = 0 \\implies F_{QR} = -F_{PR}$.\n\n$\\Sigma F_x = 0$: $F + F_{PR} \\cos(45^\\circ) - F_{QR} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\nSubstitute $F_{QR} = -F_{PR}$:\n$F + F_{PR} \\cos(45^\\circ) - (-F_{PR}) \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\n$F + 2 F_{PR} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\n$F + 2 F_{PR} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 0$\n$F + \\sqrt{2} F_{PR} = 0 \\implies F_{PR} = -\\frac{F}{\\sqrt{2}}$ (Compression)\nThen, $F_{QR} = -F_{PR} = \\frac{F}{\\sqrt{2}}$ (Tension)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the virtual forces ($F_{1,i}$) in each member due to a unit horizontal load (1) applied at R in the desired direction.**\nApply a unit horizontal load of 1 (to the right) at joint R. Let $f_{PR}$ and $f_{QR}$ be the virtual forces.\n\nEquilibrium equations for joint R with unit load:\n$\\Sigma F_y = 0$: $f_{PR} \\sin(45^\\circ) + f_{QR} \\sin(45^\\circ) = 0 \\implies f_{QR} = -f_{PR}$.\n\n$\\Sigma F_x = 0$: $1 + f_{PR} \\cos(45^\\circ) - f_{QR} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\nSubstitute $f_{QR} = -f_{PR}$:\n$1 + 2 f_{PR} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 0$\n$1 + 2 f_{PR} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 0$\n$1 + \\sqrt{2} f_{PR} = 0 \\implies f_{PR} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ (Compression)\nThen, $f_{QR} = -f_{PR} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ (Tension)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the lengths of the members ($L_i$).**\nGiven the vertical distance $l$ and the $45^\\circ$ angle with the horizontal:\n$L_{PR} = L_{QR} = \\frac{l}{\\sin(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{l}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}l$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Unit Load Method formula for displacement.**\nThe horizontal displacement $\\delta_R$ at point R is given by:\n$\\delta_R = \\sum_{{i=1}}^{{n}} \\frac{{F_{{A,i}} F_{{1,i}} L_i}}{{A_i E_i}}$\nSince $A_i = A_0$ and $E_i = E$ for both members:\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{1}{A_0 E} \\left( F_{PR} f_{PR} L_{PR} + F_{QR} f_{QR} L_{QR} \\right)$\n\nSubstitute the calculated values:\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{1}{A_0 E} \\left( \\left(-\\frac{F}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) (\\sqrt{2}l) + \\left(\\frac{F}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) (\\sqrt{2}l) \\right)$\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{1}{A_0 E} \\left( \\left(\\frac{F}{2}\\right) (\\sqrt{2}l) + \\left(\\frac{F}{2}\\right) (\\sqrt{2}l) \\right)$\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{1}{A_0 E} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}Fl}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}Fl}{2} \\right)$\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{1}{A_0 E} \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}Fl}{2} \\right)$\n$\\delta_R = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}Fl}{A_0 E}$\n\nThis result matches option C."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the problem objective, which is to find the horizontal displacement of joint R. Identify the truss geometry: a symmetric two-member truss (PR and QR) with pinned supports at P and Q. Both members are inclined at 45° to the horizontal. Given the vertical height 'l' from the support line to R, the length of each member is L = l / sin(45°) = √2 l.",
        "Step 2: Apply the Method of Joints at R to determine the actual axial forces (F_A,i) in members PR and QR due to the applied horizontal load F. Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) of joint R. Due to symmetry, F_PR = F_QR. Summing horizontal forces (Σ F_x = 0): F + 2 F_PR cos 45° = 0. Solving for F_PR gives F_PR = F_QR = -F / (2 cos 45°) = -F / √2 (compression).",
        "Step 3: Apply a virtual unit horizontal load (1 unit) at joint R in the direction of the desired displacement. Using the Method of Joints, determine the virtual axial forces (f_i) in members PR and QR. By similar equilibrium, f_PR = f_QR = -1 / (2 cos 45°) = -1 / √2 (compression).",
        "Step 4: Use the Unit Load Method formula to calculate the displacement: δ = Σ (F_A,i f_i L_i) / (A_i E_i). Here, F_A,i are actual forces, f_i are virtual forces, L_i are member lengths, A_i are cross-sectional areas, and E_i are Young's moduli. Both members have the same A_0 and E.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the calculated values into the formula. For each member (PR and QR): F_A,i = -F/√2, f_i = -1/√2, L_i = √2l, A_i = A_0, E_i = E. The term for one member is: [(-F/√2)(-1/√2)(√2l)] / (A_0 E) = [(F/2)(√2l)] / (A_0 E) = (F√2l) / (2A_0 E).",
        "Step 6: Sum the contributions from both members. Since there are two identical members, the total horizontal displacement is: δ_R = 2 × (F√2l) / (2A_0 E) = (F√2l) / (A_0 E).",
        "Step 7: The final horizontal displacement of joint R is δ_R = √2 Fl / (EA_0)."
