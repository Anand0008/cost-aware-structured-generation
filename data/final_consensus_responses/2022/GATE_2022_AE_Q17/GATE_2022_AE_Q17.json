      "reasoning": "The question asks for the viscous force exerted by fluid layer L1 on L2.\n1.  **Analyze the Velocity Profile:** The image shows a velocity distribution u(y) where u is the horizontal velocity. The velocity in layer L1 (higher y) is greater than the velocity in layer L2 (lower y), i.e., u_L1 > u_L2.\n2.  **Determine the Velocity Gradient:** If we assume the standard coordinate system where y increases upwards, then as y increases, u increases (or rather, as y decreases, u decreases). This means the velocity gradient `du/dy` is positive (`du/dy > 0`).\n3.  **Apply Newton's Law of Viscosity:** For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ is given by $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Since $\\mu > 0$ and `du/dy > 0` (under the standard y-up convention), it follows that $\\tau_{yx} > 0$.\n4.  **Interpret Shear Stress and Force Direction (Crucial Step):**\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (Newton's Third Law):** The shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ (positive in this case) represents the x-component of the force per unit area exerted *by the fluid at a lower y-coordinate (L2) on the fluid at a higher y-coordinate (L1)*. Since $\\tau_{yx} > 0$, L2 exerts a force on L1 in the positive x-direction (to the right). By Newton's Third Law, L1 must exert an equal and opposite force on L2. Therefore, the force exerted by L1 on L2 is to the *left* (negative x-direction).\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (Coordinate System Convention):** If the vertical coordinate y is considered to increase downwards in the diagram, then as y increases, u decreases. In this case, `du/dy` would be negative (`du/dy < 0`). Consequently, $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$ would be negative. A negative shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ (when defined as the force exerted by the fluid above on the fluid below) implies a force in the negative x-direction, i.e., to the *left*.\nBoth interpretations lead to the conclusion that the viscous force exerted by L1 on L2 is to the left. This aligns with the correct answer option B."
