      "reasoning": "The velocity field \\(\\vec{V} = a y \\\\hat{i} + b x \\\\hat{j}\\) is rotational, meaning Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied across streamlines. For steady, incompressible, inviscid flow neglecting gravity, the differential form of Euler's equations applies: \\(\\rho (\\\\vec{V} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla) \\\\vec{V} = - \\\\nabla p\\). First, calculate the convective acceleration components: \\(a_x = u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} + v \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} = (a y)(0) + (b x)(a) = a b x\\) and \\(a_y = u \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} + v \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} = (a y)(b) + (b x)(0) = a b y\\). From Euler's equations, we have \\(\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} = - \\\\rho a_x = - \\\\rho a b x\\) and \\(\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} = - \\\\rho a_y = - \\\\rho a b y\\).

Using the given condition \\(p(0,0) = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa}\\), we find \\(C = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa}\\). Substituting the values \\(\\rho = 1\\\\,\\\\text{kg/m}^3\\), \\(a = 10\\\\,\\\\text{s}^{-1}\\), \\(b = 20\\\\,\\\\text{s}^{-1}\\) and the point \\((x,y) = (6,8)\\\\): \\(p(6,8) = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} - \\\\frac{1}{2} (1\\\\,\\\\text{kg/m}^3) (10\\\\,\\\\text{s}^{-1}) (20\\\\,\\\\text{s}^{-1}) (6^2 + 8^2)\\\\text{m}^2 = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} - \\\\frac{1}{2} (200) (36 + 64)\\\\text{Pa} = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} - \\\\frac{1}{2} (200) (100)\\\\text{Pa} = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} - 10000\\\\,\\\\text{Pa} = 100\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} - 10\\\\,\\\\text{kPa} = 90\\\\,\\\\text{kPa}\\).

        "Step 2: Compute Convective Acceleration. Calculate the partial derivatives of velocity components and then compute the convective acceleration components: $a_x = u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = abx$ and $a_y = u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = aby$.",
        "Step 3: Apply Euler's Equations to find Pressure Gradients. Use Euler's equations (neglecting gravity) $\\rho a_x = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$ and $\\rho a_y = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}$ to determine the pressure gradients: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -\\rho abx$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = -\\rho aby$.",
        "Step 4: Integrate Pressure Gradients and Apply Boundary Condition. Integrate the pressure gradients to find the pressure field $p(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\rho ab(x^2 + y^2) + C$.

        "Step 5: Differentiate this with respect to y and equate to \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}: \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = f'(y) = -\\rho a b y, so integrate f(y) = -\\rho a b \\frac{y^2}{2} + C.",
        "Step 6: Combine: p(x,y) = -\\frac{\\rho a b}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + C. Apply boundary condition at (0,0): p(0,0)=100 kPa = C.",
        "Step 7: Substitute values: \\rho=1 kg/m^3, a b=200 s^{-2}, at (6,8), x^2+y^2=36+64=100. Pressure drop = \\frac{1 \\times 200 \\times 100}{2} = 10000 Pa = 10 kPa.",
