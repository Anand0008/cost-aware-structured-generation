      "reasoning": "The problem is solved by applying the principle of dynamic similarity. For geometric similarity and the same Reynolds number (Re), the drag coefficient (C_D) is identical for both the model and the prototype. The drag force formula D = (1/2) * ρ * V^2 * S * C_D is used, where S is the reference area (frontal area for axial flow, S = πD^2/4). By equating C_D for model and prototype and using the Re equality condition (ρ_m * V_m * D_m / μ_m = ρ_p * V_p * D_p / μ_p), a direct relationship for the drag ratio can be derived: D_p / D_m = (ρ_m / ρ_p) * (μ_p / μ_m)^2. Plugging in the given values (prototype diameter D_p = 0.9 m, model diameter D_m = 0.45 m, densities ρ_air = 1.2 kg/m^3, ρ_water = 1000 kg/m^3, viscosities μ_air = 1.86 x 10^-5 Pa-s, μ_water = 1.01 x 10^-3 Pa-s, and model drag D_m = 2280 N) yields D_p ≈ 644 N. This value matches the expected answer."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle and given data. For dynamic similarity and identical drag coefficients (C_D), the Reynolds numbers (Re) must match between the prototype (full-scale object in air) and the model (half-scaled in water). List all known parameters for both the prototype and the model, ensuring consistent units (e.g., convert mm to m).",
        "Step 2: Write the Reynolds number equality and the drag force equation. The Reynolds number is Re = (ρVD)/μ. The drag force is D = (1/2)ρV^2SC_D, where S is the reference area. For a cylinder moving axially, the frontal area S = (πD^2)/4. Since C_D is identical for dynamically similar flows, we have C_D,m = C_D,p.",
        "Step 1: Express the velocity ratio from Reynolds number matching. From $Re_m = Re_p$, we get: $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m D_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p D_p}{\\mu_p}$. Rearranging: $\\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\frac{D_p}{D_m} \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p}$.",
        "Step 2: Form the drag force ratio. Using the drag formula: $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p^2 S_p}{\\rho_m V_m^2 S_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\left(\\frac{V_p}{V_m}\\right)^2 \\frac{S_p}{S_m}$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the area and velocity ratios. Since the model is geometrically half-scaled, $D_m = D_p / 2$. Thus, $S_p / S_m = (D_p / D_m)^2 = 4$. Substitute $V_p/V_m$ from Step 1 into the drag ratio: $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\frac{D_m}{D_p} \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2 \\times 4 = \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2$ (noting that $(D_m/D_p)^2 = 1/4$ cancels the factor of 4).",
        "Step 4: Insert numerical values. Given: $\\rho_p = 1.2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_p = 1.86 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{Pa·s}$, $\\rho_m = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_m = 1.01 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa·s}$, $D_m = 2280 \\, \\text{N}$. Compute $\\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{1.86 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.01 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.0184158$. Then $\\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)^2 \\approx 3.3914 \\times 10^{-4}$. $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{1000}{1.2} = 833.333$. Therefore, $\\frac{D_p}{D_m} = 833.333 \\times 3.3914 \\times 10^{-4} \\approx 0.28262$. Finally, $D_p = 2280 \\times 0.28262 \\approx 644.37 \\, \\text{N}$, rounding to 644 N.",
