      "reasoning": "For February to have a fifth Monday, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The 1st day of February must be a Monday.\n2.  February must have 29 days (i.e., it must be a leap year), as a 28-day February would only allow for four occurrences of any given day of the week.\n\nGiven that the 1st of February is a Monday, let's evaluate each option:\n*   **A. The 2nd February of that year is a Tuesday:** If February 1st is a Monday, then February 2nd logically follows as a Tuesday. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **B. There will be five Sundays in the month of February in that year:** If February 1st is a Monday, then February 7th is a Sunday. The Sundays in that month would be February 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th. There are only four Sundays. This statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **C. The 1st February of that year is a Sunday:** This contradicts our initial deduction that February 1st must be a Monday for there to be a fifth Monday. This statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **D. All Mondays of February in that year have even dates:** If February 1st is a Monday, the Mondays would fall on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. The dates 1, 15, and 29 are odd. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, only statement A is correct."

If the first Monday was on Feb 2nd or later, the fifth Monday (Feb 2 + 4*7 = Feb 30 or later) would not fit within 29 days. Therefore, February 1st must be a Monday.",
        "Step 3: List the dates of Mondays in that February. Since February 1st is a Monday and it's a leap year (29 days), the Mondays are: Feb 1, Feb 8, Feb 15, Feb 22, and Feb 29.",

        "Step 5: Evaluate Option B: There are five Sundays in February. If February 1st is a Monday, then February 7th is a Sunday. The Sundays in February would be Feb 7, Feb 14, Feb 21, and Feb 28. There are only four Sundays. This statement is incorrect.",
