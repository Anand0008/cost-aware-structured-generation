      "reasoning": "The calculated number of stages is approximately 5.33. Since the number of stages must be an integer and must achieve at least the required compression, it is rounded up to the next higher integer, which is 6. This is derived by first calculating the specific work per stage using the work coefficient and blade speed, then finding the temperature rise per stage. The overall isentropic temperature ratio required for the given pressure ratio is then calculated using the isentropic relation. Finally, the total temperature rise is divided by the temperature rise per stage to find the number of stages."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the given parameters: Inlet P1=1 atm, T1=300 K, exit P2\\ge5 atm, mean blade speed U=245 m/s, work coefficient \\psi = \\Delta C_\\theta/U = 0.55, air properties Cp=1005 J/(kg\\cdot K), R=287 J/(kg\\cdot K), \\gamma=1.4. Compression is isentropic.",
        "Step 2: Relate work coefficient to specific work input per stage. The Euler work equation for a stage gives specific work: w = U\\Delta C_\\theta = \\psi U^2 = 0.55 * (245)^2 = 0.55 * 60025 = 33013.75 J/kg.",
        "Step 3: For an isentropic stage, the specific work equals the isentropic enthalpy rise: w = Cp \\Delta T_s, where \\Delta T_s is the isentropic temperature rise per stage. Thus, \\Delta T_s = w / Cp = 33013.75 / 1005 \\approx 32.8495 K.",
        "Step 4: Determine the overall temperature rise required for an isentropic compression from 1 atm to 5 atm. Using the isentropic relation: T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^(({\\gamma}-1)/{\\gamma}) = 5^(0.4/1.4) = 5^(2/7) \\approx 1.5846. Hence, T2 = 300 * 1.5846 \\approx 475.38 K. The overall temperature rise \\Delta T_total = 475.38 - 300 = 175.38 K.",
        "Step 5: Since each stage provides approximately the same \\Delta T_s (because w and Cp are constant), the number of stages needed is N = \\Delta T_total / \\Delta T_s \\approx 175.38 / 32.8495 \\approx 5.34.",
        "Step 6: The number of stages must be an integer, and the exit pressure must be at least 5 atm, so we round up to the next higher integer. Therefore, N = 6 stages."
