Let the side length of the square be $L = 1$ cm.\n\n**Case M:**\n1.  The square contains 4 equal-sized circular regions arranged in a $2 \\times 2$ grid.\n2.  For these circles to fit perfectly, the diameter of each circle must be $D_M = L/2 = 1/2$ cm.\n3.  The radius of each circle is $r_M = D_M / 2 = (1/2) / 2 = 1/4$ cm.\n4.  The area of one circle is $A_{cM} = \\pi r_M^2 = \\pi (1/4)^2 = \\pi/16$ cm$^2$.\n5.  The total shaded area in Case M is $A_{shaded\\_M} = 4 \\times A_{cM} = 4 \\times (\\pi/16) = \\pi/4$ cm$^2$.\n6.  The area of the square sheet is $A_{square} = L^2 = (1 \\text{ cm})^2 = 1$ cm$^2$.\n7.  The unshaded area in Case M is $A_{unshaded\\_M} = A_{square} - A_{shaded\\_M} = 1 - \\pi/4$ cm$^2$.\n\n**Case N:**\n1.  The square contains 9 equal-sized circular regions arranged in a $3 \\times 3$ grid.\n2.  For these circles to fit perfectly, the diameter of each circle must be $D_N = L/3 = 1/3$ cm.\n3.  The radius of each circle is $r_N = D_N / 2 = (1/3) / 2 = 1/6$ cm.\n4.  The area of one circle is $A_{cN} = \\pi r_N^2 = \\pi (1/6)^2 = \\pi/36$ cm$^2$.\n5.  The total shaded area in Case N is $A_{shaded\\_N} = 9 \\times A_{cN} = 9 \\times (\\pi/36) = \\pi/4$ cm$^2$.\n6.  The unshaded area in Case N is $A_{unshaded\\_N} = A_{square} - A_{shaded\\_N} = 1 - \\pi/4$ cm$^2$.\n\n**Ratio of unshaded areas:**\nThe ratio of the unshaded regions of Case M to that of Case N is:\n$\\frac{A_{unshaded\\_M}}{A_{unshaded\\_N}} = \\frac{1 - \\pi/4}{1 - \\pi/4} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 1:1."
