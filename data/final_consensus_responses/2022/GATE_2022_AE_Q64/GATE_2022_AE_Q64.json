      "reasoning": "For an ideal ramjet with exhaust gases optimally expanded to ambient pressure, the exhaust Mach number ($M_e$) is equal to the flight Mach number ($M_0$). The solution involves calculating the speed of sound at the nozzle exit ($a_e$) using the given exhaust properties ($V_e$, $T_e$, $\\gamma_{exhaust}$, $R_{exhaust}$) to find $M_e = V_e/a_e$. Then, equating $M_0 = M_e$, the speed of sound at ambient conditions ($a_0$) is calculated using ambient air properties ($T_0$, $\\gamma_{air}$, $R_{air}$). Finally, the cruise speed $V_0$ is determined from $V_0 = M_0 a_0$. A key point is to correctly interpret \"Cp = 287 J/(kg-K) for air\" as $R_{air} = 287$ J/(kg-K), as is common in such problems."

        "Step 2: Calculate the speed of sound at the nozzle exit ($a_e$) using $a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{exhaust} R T_e}$. Then, determine the exhaust Mach number ($M_e$) using the definition $M_e = V_e / a_e$.",
        "Step 3: For the isentropic nozzle, compute the total pressure ratio across it using the isentropic relation: $P_{t4}/P_e = (1 + (\\gamma_{exhaust}-1)/2 \\cdot M_e^2)^{\\gamma_{exhaust}/(\\gamma_{exhaust}-1)}$.",
        "Step 4: For an ideal ramjet with optimal expansion ($P_e = P_0$) and isentropic diffuser and nozzle, the total pressure ratio across the diffuser equals that across the nozzle: $P_{t2}/P_0 = P_{t4}/P_e$. Use the diffuser isentropic relation $P_{t2}/P_0 = (1 + (\\gamma_{air}-1)/2 \\cdot M_0^2)^{\\gamma_{air}/(\\gamma_{air}-1)}$ and the calculated $P_{t4}/P_e$ to solve for the flight Mach number ($M_0$).",

However, if one assumes same Cp and constant gamma, then Tt4/Tt2 = (P_t4/P_t2)^((γ-1)/γ) = 1 (since Pt4=Pt2) would imply Tt4=Tt2, which is false. So not applicable directly.",
