      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the height of a right circular cone of maximum volume that can be enclosed within a hollow sphere of radius R. This is a classic optimization problem solved using differential calculus.\n\n1.  **Define variables and set up geometry:**\n    Let the radius of the sphere be `R`. Place the center of the sphere at the origin `(0,0,0)`. The equation of the sphere is `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2`.\n    Let the height of the cone be `h` and its base radius be `r`.\n    For maximum volume, the cone's apex must lie on the sphere's surface, and its base must be a circle inscribed within a cross-section of the sphere.\n    Consider the apex of the cone to be at `(0, 0, R)` (the 'top' of the sphere). The base of the cone will then be a circle in a plane `z = R - h`. A point on the circumference of this base circle will have coordinates `(r, 0, R - h)`.\n\n2.  **Relate cone dimensions to sphere radius:**\n    Since the point `(r, 0, R - h)` lies on the sphere, it must satisfy the sphere's equation:\n    `r^2 + 0^2 + (R - h)^2 = R^2`\n    `r^2 + (R - h)^2 = R^2`\n    `r^2 = R^2 - (R - h)^2`\n    `r^2 = R^2 - (R^2 - 2Rh + h^2)`\n    `r^2 = 2Rh - h^2`\n\n3.  **Formulate the volume of the cone:**\n    The volume of a right circular cone is given by `V = (1/3)πr^2h`.\n    Substitute the expression for `r^2` from step 2 into the volume formula:\n    `V(h) = (1/3)π(2Rh - h^2)h`\n    `V(h) = (1/3)π(2Rh^2 - h^3)`\n\n4.  **Find the domain for h:**\n    The height `h` must be positive, so `h > 0`. Also, the cone's base must be within the sphere, meaning `r^2 >= 0`. From `r^2 = 2Rh - h^2`, we have `h(2R - h) >= 0`. Since `h > 0`, it must be that `2R - h >= 0`, which implies `h <= 2R`. So, the domain for `h` is `0 < h <= 2R`.\n\n5.  **Optimize the volume using differentiation:**\n    To find the maximum volume, differentiate `V(h)` with respect to `h` and set the derivative to zero:\n    `dV/dh = (1/3)π(4Rh - 3h^2)`\n    Set `dV/dh = 0`:\n    `(1/3)π(4Rh - 3h^2) = 0`\n    `4Rh - 3h^2 = 0`\n    `h(4R - 3h) = 0`\n    This gives two possible solutions: `h = 0` or `4R - 3h = 0`.\n    `h = 0` corresponds to a cone with zero height, hence zero volume (a minimum).\n    `4R - 3h = 0 ⇒ 3h = 4R ⇒ h = 4R/3`.\n\n6.  **Verify that it's a maximum:**\n    Calculate the second derivative of `V(h)`:\n    `d^2V/dh^2 = (1/3)π(4R - 6h)`\n    Substitute `h = 4R/3` into the second derivative:\n    `d^2V/dh^2 = (1/3)π(4R - 6(4R/3))`\n    `d^2V/dh^2 = (1/3)π(4R - 8R)`\n    `d^2V/dh^2 = (1/3)π(-4R) = -4πR/3`\n    Since `R` is a radius, `R > 0`. Therefore, `d^2V/dh^2` is negative, confirming that `h = 4R/3` corresponds to a maximum volume.\n\nThus, the height of the right circular cone of maximum volume is `4R/3`."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Derivation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the problem. The goal is to find the height `h` of a right circular cone that has the maximum possible volume when inscribed within a sphere of radius `R`. Define the cone's height as `h` and its base radius as `r`.",
        "Step 2: Establish geometric relationships. Place the sphere's center at the origin. Let the cone's apex be at the top of the sphere. If the cone's base is at a distance `x` from the sphere's center, then the cone's height `h = R + x`. The base radius `r` and distance `x` are related by the Pythagorean theorem: `r^2 + x^2 = R^2`.",
        "Step 3: Express `r^2` in terms of `h` and `R`. From `h = R + x`, we get `x = h - R`. Substitute this into the Pythagorean relation: `r^2 = R^2 - (h - R)^2 = R^2 - (h^2 - 2Rh + R^2) = 2Rh - h^2`.",
        "Step 4: Write the volume of the cone `V` as a function of `h`. The formula for the volume of a cone is `V = (1/3)πr^2h`. Substitute the expression for `r^2` from Step 3: `V(h) = (1/3)π(2Rh - h^2)h = (π/3)(2Rh^2 - h^3)`.",
        "Step 5: Determine the feasible domain for `h`. The height `h` must be greater than `R` (for a non-degenerate cone with apex at the top) and less than `2R` (the diameter of the sphere). So, `R < h < 2R`.",
        "Step 6: Differentiate `V(h)` with respect to `h` and set the derivative to zero to find critical points. `dV/dh = (π/3)(4Rh - 3h^2)`. Setting `dV/dh = 0` gives `(π/3)h(4R - 3h) = 0`.",
        "Step 7: Solve for `h`. The solutions are `h = 0` (which results in zero volume and is trivial) or `4R - 3h = 0`, which yields `h = 4R/3`. This value is within the feasible domain `(R, 2R)`.",
        "Step 8: Verify that `h = 4R/3` corresponds to a maximum using the second derivative test. The second derivative is `d^2V/dh^2 = (π/3)(4R - 6h)`. At `h = 4R/3`, `d^2V/dh^2 = (π/3)(4R - 6(4R/3)) = (π/3)(4R - 8R) = -4πR/3`. Since `R > 0`, `d^2V/dh^2 < 0`, confirming that `h = 4R/3` corresponds to a local maximum volume. Thus, the height of the cone with maximum volume is `4R/3`."
