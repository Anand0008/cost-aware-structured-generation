      "reasoning": "The problem describes a steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow over a non-porous flat plate within a control volume PQRS. The core principle to solve this is the conservation of mass, which for incompressible flow simplifies to the conservation of volume flow rate. This means the total volume flow rate entering the control volume must equal the total volume flow rate leaving it.\n\nLet's analyze the flow through each section of the control volume:\n1.  **Section PQ (Inlet):** The flow enters the control volume. The velocity is uniform, $u_{\\infty}$, over a height $h$. The volume flow rate into the control volume through PQ is:\n    $$Q_{PQ} = u_{\\infty} \\times h$$\n2.  **Section RS (Outlet):** The flow leaves the control volume. The velocity profile is given by $u(y) = A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n$ over the height $h$. To find the total volume flow rate out of the control volume through RS, we must integrate the velocity profile over the height:\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\int_{0}^{h} u(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{h} A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n dy$$\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\int_{0}^{h} y^n dy = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left[\\frac{y^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right]_{0}^{h}$$\n    $$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left(\\frac{h^{n+1}}{n+1} - 0\\right) = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$$\n3.  **Section QR (Bottom - Flat Plate):** The problem states it's a non-porous flat plate. This implies no fluid can pass through this boundary. Therefore, the volume flow rate through QR is:\n    $$Q_{QR} = 0$$\n4.  **Section PS (Top Boundary):** The problem explicitly states that the flow through section PS will vanish. This means the volume flow rate through PS is:\n    $$Q_{PS} = 0$$\n\nNow, applying the principle of conservation of volume flow rate for the control volume PQRS (Total flow in = Total flow out):\n$$Q_{PQ} + Q_{QR} = Q_{RS} + Q_{PS}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given flow rates:\n$$u_{\\infty} h + 0 = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1} + 0$$\n$$u_{\\infty} h = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$$\nSince $h$ is a non-zero height, we can divide both sides by $h$:\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{A_0}{n+1}$$\nFinally, solving for $A_0$:\n$$A_0 = u_{\\infty} (n+1)$$\nThis result matches option B."

        "Step 1: Apply the principle of conservation of mass (continuity equation) for steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow to the control volume PQRS. This implies that the net volume flow rate into the control volume must equal the net volume flow rate out of it, i.e., $\\sum Q_{in} = \\sum Q_{out}$.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the flow through each boundary of the control volume PQRS.\n*   **Section PQ (Inlet):** Flow enters with uniform velocity $u_{\\infty}$ over height $h$. The volume flow rate is $Q_{PQ} = u_{\\infty} h$.\n*   **Section QR (Bottom):** This is a non-porous flat plate, so there is no flow through it: $Q_{QR} = 0$.\n*   **Section PS (Top):** The problem states that the flow through this section vanishes: $Q_{PS} = 0$.\n*   **Section RS (Outlet):** Flow leaves with a velocity profile $u(y) = A_0 (y/h)^n$ over height $h$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the volume flow rate at the outlet (Section RS) by integrating the velocity profile over the height $h$:\n$Q_{RS} = \\int_{0}^{h} u(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{h} A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n dy$\n$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\int_{0}^{h} y^n dy = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left[\\frac{y^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right]_{0}^{h}$\n$Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0}{h^n} \\left(\\frac{h^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right) = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$",
        "Calculate the volume flow rate per unit width at the inlet (section PQ). Since the velocity $u_{\\infty}$ is uniform over the height $h$, the volume flow rate is $Q_{PQ} = u_{\\infty} h$.",
        "Calculate the volume flow rate per unit width at the outlet (section RS). The velocity profile is given as $u(y) = A_0 (y/h)^n$. Integrate this profile over the height $h$: $Q_{RS} = \\int_{0}^{h} u(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{h} A_0 \\left(\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^n dy$. Evaluating this integral yields $Q_{RS} = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$.",
        "Account for flow at other boundaries. Section QR is a non-porous flat plate, so $Q_{QR} = 0$. Section PS has vanishing flow, so $Q_{PS} = 0$. Apply the conservation of volume flow rate (continuity equation) for the control volume: $\\sum Q_{in} = \\sum Q_{out}$. This simplifies to $Q_{PQ} = Q_{RS}$.",
        "Substitute the calculated flow rates into the continuity equation: $u_{\\infty} h = \\frac{A_0 h}{n+1}$. Solve for $A_0$: $A_0 = u_{\\infty} (n+1)$."
