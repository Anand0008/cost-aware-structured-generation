The characteristic equation is $m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0$, which gives $m = 1$ (repeated root). The general solution for repeated roots is $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x) e^{x}$. Applying boundary conditions: $y(0) = 0$ gives $C_1 = 0$. Then $y(x) = C_2 x e^{x}$. Differentiating, $y'(x) = C_2 e^{x} (1 + x)$. Using $y'(0) = 1$, we get $C_2 = 1$. Thus, $y(x) = x e^{x}$. Evaluating at $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, $y(1/2) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{e}}{2}$, which matches option C."
