      "reasoning": "The system consists of a uniform rigid prismatic bar of total mass $m$ and length $l$, suspended by two identical springs of stiffness $k$. This is a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system. The two independent motions are vertical translation of the center of mass ($y$) and rotation about the center of mass ($\theta$).\n\n1.  **Generalized Coordinates:** Let $y$ be the vertical displacement of the center of mass (CM) and $\theta$ be the angular displacement about the CM.\n2.  **Kinetic Energy (T):** The bar has both translational and rotational kinetic energy.\n    $T = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\dot{\\theta}^2$\n    For a uniform rigid bar of mass $m$ and length $l$, the moment of inertia about its center of mass is $I_{CM} = \\frac{1}{12}ml^2$.\n    So, $T = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}ml^2\\right)\\dot{\\theta}^2$\n3.  **Potential Energy (V):** The potential energy is stored in the two springs. The displacement of the left end of the bar is $y_L = y - \\frac{l}{2}\\theta$, and the right end is $y_R = y + \\frac{l}{2}\\theta$.\n    $V = \\frac{1}{2}k(y_L)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(y_R)^2$\n    $V = \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(y - \\frac{l}{2}\\theta\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(y + \\frac{l}{2}\\theta\\right)^2$\n    Expanding this, $V = \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(y^2 - yl\\theta + \\frac{l^2}{4}\\theta^2 + y^2 + yl\\theta + \\frac{l^2}{4}\\theta^2\\right)$\n    $V = \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(2y^2 + \\frac{l^2}{2}\\theta^2\\right) = ky^2 + \\frac{1}{4}kl^2\\theta^2$\n4.  **Mass and Stiffness Matrices:** From the kinetic and potential energy expressions, we can form the mass matrix $[M]$ and stiffness matrix $[K]$ for the generalized coordinates $\\{y, \\theta\\}^T$.\n    $[M] = \\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{12}ml^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $[K] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2k & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2}kl^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The off-diagonal terms are zero, indicating that the translational and rotational motions are uncoupled due to the symmetry of the system.\n5.  **Characteristic Equation:** The natural frequencies are found by solving the eigenvalue problem $det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0$.\n    $det\\begin{bmatrix} 2k - m\\omega^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2}kl^2 - \\frac{1}{12}ml^2\\omega^2 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\n    Since the matrix is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements:\n    $(2k - m\\omega^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}kl^2 - \\frac{1}{12}ml^2\\omega^2\\right) = 0$\n6.  **Natural Frequencies:** This equation yields two solutions for $\\omega^2$.\n    *   **Mode I (Translational Mode, $\\omega_1$):**\n        $2k - m\\omega_1^2 = 0 \\implies \\omega_1^2 = \\frac{2k}{m} \\implies \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{m}}$\n    *   **Mode II (Rotational Mode, $\\omega_2$):**\n        $\\frac{1}{2}kl^2 - \\frac{1}{12}ml^2\\omega_2^2 = 0$\n        Dividing by $l^2$ (assuming $l \\neq 0$):\n        $\\frac{1}{2}k - \\frac{1}{12}m\\omega_2^2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{12}m\\omega_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\implies \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{6k}{m} \\implies \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{6k}{m}}$\n7.  **Ratio $\\omega_2/\\omega_1$:**\n    $\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{6k}{m}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{m}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6k/m}{2k/m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{2}} = \\sqrt{3}$\n    The numerical value of $\\sqrt{3}$ is approximately $1.732$.\n8.  **Rounding:** Rounded off to one decimal place, the value is $1.7$. This falls within the given range of 1.7 to 1.8."
