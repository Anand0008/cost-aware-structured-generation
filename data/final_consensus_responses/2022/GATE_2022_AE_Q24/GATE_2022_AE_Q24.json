      "reasoning": "The expression `a . (b x c)` is known as the scalar triple product. Geometrically, it represents the signed volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nGiven that `a`, `b`, and `c` are three mutually perpendicular unit vectors:\n1.  **Unit Vectors**: This means their magnitudes are 1: `|a| = 1`, `|b| = 1`, `|c| = 1`.\n2.  **Mutually Perpendicular**: This means the angle between any two distinct vectors is `90^\\circ`. So, `a \\perp b`, `b \\perp c`, and `c \\perp a`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate the cross product `b x c`**\nSince `b` and `c` are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, the magnitude of their cross product is:\n`|b x c| = |b||c|sin(90^\\circ) = (1)(1)(1) = 1`.\nThe direction of `b x c` is perpendicular to both `b` and `c`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate `b x c` to `a`**\nSince `a` is also a unit vector that is mutually perpendicular to both `b` and `c`, the vector `a` must be parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of `b x c`. Therefore, `b x c` must be either `a` or `-a`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the dot product `a . (b x c)` for both possibilities**\n*   **Case 1: `b x c = a` (Right-Handed System)**\n    If `a`, `b`, `c` form a right-handed system (like the standard `i, j, k` Cartesian unit vectors where `i . (j x k) = i . i = 1`), then `b x c = a`.\n    Substituting this into the expression: `a . (b x c) = a . a`.\n    Since `a` is a unit vector, `a . a = |a|^2 = 1^2 = 1`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `b x c = -a` (Left-Handed System)**\n    If `a`, `b`, `c` form a left-handed system (e.g., if `a=i, b=k, c=j`, then `i . (k x j) = i . (-i) = -1`), then `b x c = -a`.\n    Substituting this into the expression: `a . (b x c) = a . (-a)`.\n    `a . (-a) = - (a . a) = -|a|^2 = -1^2 = -1`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince both right-handed and left-handed orientations are possible for three mutually perpendicular unit vectors, the scalar triple product `a . (b x c)` can take the values `1` or `-1`. Therefore, options B and C are correct."

        "Step 1: Understand the given conditions. The vectors `a`, `b`, `c` are unit vectors, meaning their magnitudes are 1 (`|a|=|b|=|c|=1`). They are also mutually perpendicular, meaning the angle between any two of them is `90^\\circ` (e.g., `a \\cdot b = 0`).",
        "Step 2: Evaluate the cross product `b x c`. Since `b` and `c` are perpendicular unit vectors, the magnitude of their cross product is `|b x c| = |b||c|sin(90^\\circ) = (1)(1)(1) = 1`. The direction of `b x c` is perpendicular to both `b` and `c`.",
        "Step 3: Determine the direction of `b x c`. The vector `b x c` is perpendicular to both `b` and `c`. Since `a` is also a unit vector mutually perpendicular to `b` and `c`, the vector `b x c` must be parallel or anti-parallel to `a`.",
        "Step 4: Express `b x c` in terms of `a`. Since `b x c` is a unit vector perpendicular to both `b` and `c`, and `a` is also a unit vector mutually perpendicular to `b` and `c`, `b x c` must be parallel or anti-parallel to `a`. Therefore, we can write `b x c = \\pm a`.",

For orthonormal vectors, this matrix is orthogonal, and its determinant will be `\\pm 1`, corresponding to a right-handed or left-handed system, respectively. For example, if `a=(1,0,0)`, `b=(0,1,0)`, `c=(0,0,1)` (right-handed), the determinant is 1. If `a=(1,0,0)`, `b=(0,0,1)`, `c=(0,1,0)` (left-handed), the determinant is -1.",
