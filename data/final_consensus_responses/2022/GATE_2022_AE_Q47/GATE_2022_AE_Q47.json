      "reasoning": "The problem involves analyzing the performance of a rocket nozzle under two different chamber pressure conditions, keeping the nozzle geometry constant. The key is to understand how the thrust coefficient ($C_F$) changes when the chamber pressure ($P_c$) changes, especially when the nozzle is initially optimally expanded but then operates off-design.\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Case 1: $P_{c1} = 20 \\text{ bar}$, $P_{e1} = 1 \\text{ bar}$ (optimally expanded), $(A_e/A_t) = 3.5$, $C_{F,1} = 1.42$.\n*   Case 2: $P_{c2} = 50 \\text{ bar}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Ambient Pressure ($P_a$) and Nozzle Exit Pressure Ratio ($P_e/P_c$) for the fixed nozzle.**\nSince the nozzle is optimally expanded in Case 1, the exit pressure $P_{e1}$ must be equal to the ambient pressure $P_a$. Therefore, $P_a = 1 \\text{ bar}$.\nFor a fixed nozzle geometry (fixed $A_e/A_t$) and a constant specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), the ratio of exit pressure to chamber pressure ($P_e/P_c$) remains constant for choked flow. This is because $A_e/A_t$ uniquely determines the exit Mach number ($M_e$), and $M_e$ uniquely determines $P_e/P_c$ through isentropic relations.\nSo, $(P_e/P_c)_1 = (P_e/P_c)_2 = P_{e1}/P_{c1} = 1 \\text{ bar} / 20 \\text{ bar} = 0.05$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the exit pressure ($P_{e2}$) for Case 2.**\nUsing the constant ratio from Step 1:\n$P_{e2} = (P_e/P_c)_2 \\times P_{c2} = 0.05 \\times 50 \\text{ bar} = 2.5 \\text{ bar}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the thrust coefficient ($C_{F,2}$) for Case 2.**\nThe general formula for the thrust coefficient is:\n$C_F = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma^2}{\\gamma - 1} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma + 1}{\\gamma - 1}} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{P_e}{P_c}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}}\\right]} + \\left(\\frac{P_e - P_a}{P_c}\\right) \\left(\\frac{A_e}{A_t}\\right)$\n\nLet the first term (momentum thrust component) be $C_{F,momentum}$. This term depends only on $\\gamma$ and $P_e/P_c$. Since $P_e/P_c$ is constant (0.05) for both cases, $C_{F,momentum}$ is the same for both cases.\n\nIn Case 1, the nozzle is optimally expanded, so $P_{e1} = P_a$. This means the pressure thrust term is zero:\n$C_{F,1} = C_{F,momentum} + \\left(\\frac{P_{e1} - P_a}{P_{c1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{A_e}{A_t}\\right) = C_{F,momentum} + 0 = C_{F,momentum}$.\nGiven $C_{F,1} = 1.42$, we have $C_{F,momentum} = 1.42$.\n\nNow, for Case 2, the nozzle is operating at $P_{e2} = 2.5 \\text{ bar}$ and $P_a = 1 \\text{ bar}$. Since $P_{e2} > P_a$, the nozzle is under-expanded, and there will be a positive pressure thrust term.\n$C_{F,2} = C_{F,momentum} + \\left(\\frac{P_{e2} - P_a}{P_{c2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{A_e}{A_t}\\right)$\n$C_{F,2} = 1.42 + \\left(\\frac{2.5 \\text{ bar} - 1 \\text{ bar}}{50 \\text{ bar}}\\right) \\times 3.5$\n$C_{F,2} = 1.42 + \\left(\\frac{1.5}{50}\\right) \\times 3.5$\n$C_{F,2} = 1.42 + 0.03 \\times 3.5$\n$C_{F,2} = 1.42 + 0.105 = 1.525$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the options for $C_F$ ratio.**\n$C_{F,2} / C_{F,1} = 1.525 / 1.42 \\approx 1.0732$.\nSince $1.0732 > 1$, statement D ($C_{F,2} / C_{F,1} > 1$) is correct.\nStatement C ($C_{F,2} / C_{F,1} = 1$) is incorrect.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the thrust ratio ($F_2/F_1$).**\nThe thrust ($F$) of a rocket engine is given by $F = C_F \\times P_c \\times A_t$.\nSince the nozzle throat area ($A_t$) is constant for the same rocket:\n$F_1 = C_{F,1} \\times P_{c1} \\times A_t = 1.42 \\times 20 \\times A_t$\n$F_2 = C_{F,2} \\times P_{c2} \\times A_t = 1.525 \\times 50 \\times A_t$\n\n$F_2/F_1 = \\frac{1.525 \\times 50 \\times A_t}{1.42 \\times 20 \\times A_t} = \\frac{1.525 \\times 50}{1.42 \\times 20} = \\frac{76.25}{28.4} \\approx 2.684$.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the options for $F$ ratio.**\nSince $2.684 > 2.5$, statement B ($F_2/F_1 > 2.5$) is correct.\nStatement A ($F_2/F_1 = 2.5$) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B and D."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Recall the thrust equation $F = C_F P_c A_t$, where throat area $A_t$ is constant for the same rocket. Identify the given parameters and initial conditions for both operating cases.",
        "Step 1: Identify the initial conditions. For the first operation, the chamber pressure $P_{c1}=20$ bar and the thrust coefficient $C_{F,1}=1.42$. Since the nozzle is 'optimally expanded', its exit pressure $P_{e1}$ is equal to the ambient pressure $P_a$. Therefore, $P_a = P_{e1} = 1$ bar.",
        "Step 2: Recognize that the nozzle geometry is fixed with an area ratio $A_e/A_t = 3.5$. For a fixed nozzle geometry and assuming a constant specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), the ratio of exit pressure to chamber pressure ($P_e/P_c$) remains constant for choked flow.",
        "Step 3: For the second operating condition with $P_{c2}=50$ bar, calculate the new exit pressure $P_{e2}$ using the constant $P_e/P_c$ ratio: $P_{e2} = (P_{e1}/P_{c1}) \\times P_{c2} = (1/20) \\times 50 = 2.5$ bar. Since $P_{e2} = 2.5$ bar is greater than the ambient pressure $P_a = 1$ bar, the nozzle is now underexpanded.",
        "Step 4: Recall the general thrust coefficient formula, which includes both momentum and pressure thrust terms. The momentum thrust component (the first term in the $C_F$ formula) depends only on $\\gamma$ and $P_e/P_c$. Since $P_e/P_c$ is constant between the two cases, this momentum thrust component is the same for both operations. For Case 1 (optimal expansion), the pressure thrust term $((P_{e1}-P_a)/P_{c1})(A_e/A_t)$ was zero, so $C_{F,1}$ represents only the momentum thrust component.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the pressure thrust term for Case 2: $\\frac{P_{e2} - P_a}{P_{c2}} \\frac{A_e}{A_t} = \\frac{2.5 - 1}{50} \\times 3.5 = \\frac{1.5}{50} \\times 3.5 = 0.03 \\times 3.5 = 0.105$.",
        "Step 6: The thrust coefficient for Case 2 is $C_{F,2} = C_{F,1} + 0.105$. Since $0.105 > 0$, it implies $C_{F,2} > C_{F,1}$, and therefore $C_{F,2}/C_{F,1} > 1$. Step 7: Compute the thrust ratio: $F_2/F_1 = (C_{F,2} P_{c2} A_t)/(C_{F,1} P_{c1} A_t) = (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1}) \\times (P_{c2}/P_{c1}) = (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1}) \\times (50/20) = (C_{F,2}/C_{F,1}) \\times 2.5$. Since $C_{F,2}/C_{F,1} > 1$, it follows that $F_2/F_1 > 2.5$."
