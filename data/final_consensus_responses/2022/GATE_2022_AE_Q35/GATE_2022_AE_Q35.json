      "reasoning": "The problem involves constructing an inlet velocity triangle for a single-stage turbine rotor to determine the rotor blade angle `beta` at the leading edge for shock-free entry.\n\nGiven:\n1.  Absolute gas velocity from stator/nozzle, `c_2 = 500 m/s`.\n2.  Angle of `c_2` with the turbine axis (axial direction), `alpha_axial = 70 degrees`.\n3.  Rotor blade speed, `u = 250 m/s`.\n\nSteps:\n1.  Resolve the absolute velocity `c_2` into its axial (`c_a2`) and tangential (`c_w2`) components using the given angle with the axial direction:\n    *   `c_a2 = c_2 * cos(alpha_axial) = 500 * cos(70°) = 500 * 0.34202 = 171.01 m/s`\n    *   `c_w2 = c_2 * sin(alpha_axial) = 500 * sin(70°) = 500 * 0.93969 = 469.845 m/s`\n2.  Determine the components of the relative velocity `w_2` at the rotor inlet. For shock-free entry, the relative velocity vector must be tangent to the blade leading edge.\n    *   The axial component of relative velocity is equal to the axial component of absolute velocity: `w_a2 = c_a2 = 171.01 m/s`.\n    *   The tangential component of relative velocity is the difference between the absolute tangential velocity and the blade speed: `w_w2 = c_w2 - u = 469.845 - 250 = 219.845 m/s`.\n3.  The rotor blade angle `beta` at the leading edge is the angle of the relative velocity `w_2` with the axial direction:\n    *   `tan(beta) = w_w2 / w_a2`\n    *   `tan(beta) = 219.845 / 171.01 = 1.2855`\n    *   `beta = arctan(1.2855) = 52.11 degrees`\n4.  Rounding to one decimal place, the rotor blade angle `beta = 52.1 degrees`. This value is consistent with the expected answer range."
