This is a power tower, which is conventionally interpreted as right-associative. So, $g(p, 1) = p$, $g(p, 2) = p^p$, $g(p, 3) = p^{(p^p)}$, and so on.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. $f(2, 2) = g(2, 2)$**\n*   Calculate $f(2, 2)$: $f(2, 2) = 2^2 = 4$\n*   Calculate $g(2, 2)$: $g(2, 2) = 2^2 = 4$\n*   Since $4 = 4$, this option is **TRUE**.\n\n**B. $f(g(2, 2), 2) < f(2, g(2, 2))$**\n*   First, find $g(2, 2) = 2^2 = 4$.\n*   Calculate the left side: $f(g(2, 2), 2) = f(4, 2) = 4^2 = 16$\n*   Calculate the right side: $f(2, g(2, 2)) = f(2, 4) = 2^4 = 16$\n*   Since $16 \\not< 16$ (they are equal), this option is **FALSE**.\n\n**C. $g(2, 1) \\neq f(2, 1)$**\n*   Calculate $g(2, 1)$: From the definition, $g(p, 1) = p$, so $g(2, 1) = 2$.\n*   Calculate $f(2, 1)$: $f(2, 1) = 2^1 = 2$.\n*   Since $2 \\not\\neq 2$ (they are equal), this option is **FALSE**.\n\n**D. $f(3, 2) > g(3, 2)$**\n*   Calculate $f(3, 2)$: $f(3, 2) = 3^2 = 9$\n*   Calculate $g(3, 2)$: $g(3, 2) = 3^3 = 27$\n*   Since $9 \\not> 27$, this option is **FALSE**.\n\nOnly option A is correct."
