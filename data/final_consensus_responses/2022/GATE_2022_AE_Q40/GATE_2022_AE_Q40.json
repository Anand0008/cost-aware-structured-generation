This ratio is directly proportional to the power required for flight (P_R \\propto C_D / C_L^(3/2)). To find the minimum, we use the drag polar equation and apply differential calculus.\n\n1.  **Start with the Drag Polar:**\n    C_D = C_{D,o} + \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}\n    Let K = \\frac{1}{\\pi e AR}. Then, C_D = C_{D,o} + K C_L^2.\n\n2.  **Formulate the function to be minimized:**\n    Let f(C_L) = \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}} = \\frac{C_{D,o} + K C_L^2}{C_L^{3/2}} = C_{D,o} C_L^{-3/2} + K C_L^{1/2}\n\n3.  **Differentiate with respect to C_L and set to zero:**\n    \\frac{df}{dC_L} = -\\frac{3}{2} C_{D,o} C_L^{-5/2} + \\frac{1}{2} K C_L^{-1/2} = 0\n\n4.  **Solve for the condition:**\n    Multiply by 2 C_L^{5/2} to clear denominators and negative exponents:\n    -3 C_{D,o} + K C_L^{5/2} C_L^{-1/2} = 0\n    -3 C_{D,o} + K C_L^2 = 0\n    This gives the condition for minimum power required:\n    K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D,o}\n\n5.  **Substitute this condition back into the drag polar to find C_D:**\n    C_D = C_{D,o} + K C_L^2 = C_{D,o} + 3 C_{D,o} = 4 C_{D,o}\n\n6.  **Form the ratio C_D / C_L^2:**\n    From K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D,o}, we have C_L^2 = \\frac{3 C_{D,o}}{K}.\n    Substitute this into the ratio: \\frac{C_D}{C_L^2} = \\frac{4 C_{D,o}}{(3 C_{D,o}/K)} = \\frac{4 K}{3}\n\n7.  **Substitute K = \\frac{1}{\\pi e AR} back:**\n    \\frac{C_D}{C_L^2} = \\frac{4}{3 \\pi e AR}\n\nThis matches option B."

        "Step 1: Identify the governing equation for total drag coefficient, known as the drag polar: $C_D = C_{D,o} + \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}$.",
        "Step 2: For simplification, define the induced drag factor $K = \\frac{1}{\\pi e AR}$. The drag polar then becomes $C_D = C_{D,o} + K C_L^2$.",
        "Step 3: Formulate the expression given in the question that needs to be minimized: $f(C_L) = \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$. Substitute the drag polar into this expression: $f(C_L) = \\frac{C_{D,o} + K C_L^2}{C_L^{3/2}} = C_{D,o} C_L^{-3/2} + K C_L^{1/2}$.",
        "Step 4: To find the minimum value of $f(C_L)$, differentiate $f(C_L)$ with respect to $C_L$ and set the derivative equal to zero: $\\frac{df}{dC_L} = -\\frac{3}{2} C_{D,o} C_L^{-5/2} + \\frac{1}{2} K C_L^{-1/2} = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the equation from Step 4 for the relationship between $C_{D,o}$ and $K C_L^2$. Multiply the entire equation by $2 C_L^{5/2}$ to eliminate fractional and negative exponents: $-3 C_{D,o} + K C_L^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D,o}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute this condition ($K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D,o}$) back into the drag polar equation ($C_D = C_{D,o} + K C_L^2$): $C_D = C_{D,o} + (3 C_{D,o}) = 4 C_{D,o}$.",
        "Step 7: From the condition $K C_L^2 = 3 C_{D,o}$, express $C_L^2$ as $C_L^2 = \\frac{3 C_{D,o}}{K}$.",
        "Step 8: Form the ratio $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^2}$ using the results from Step 6 and Step 7: $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^2} = \\frac{4 C_{D,o}}{\\frac{3 C_{D,o}}{K}} = \\frac{4 K}{3}$.",
        "Step 9: Finally, substitute $K = \\frac{1}{\\pi e AR}$ back into the ratio: $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^2} = \\frac{4}{3 \\pi e AR}$.",
