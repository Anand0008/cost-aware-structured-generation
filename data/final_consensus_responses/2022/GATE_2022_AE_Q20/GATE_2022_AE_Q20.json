      "reasoning": "The normal stress ($\\sigma_x$) in a beam subjected to pure bending is governed by the flexure formula: $\\sigma_x = \\frac{M \\cdot y}{I}$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $y$ is the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis (NA), and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the cross-section about the neutral axis. The magnitude of the normal stress is directly proportional to the distance $y$ from the neutral axis.\n\n1.  **Neutral Axis Location:** The neutral axis always passes through the centroid of the cross-section. For a standard T-shaped cross-section (as shown in the figure, with the flange at the top), it is unsymmetrical about its horizontal axis. Due to the larger area of the flange, the centroid (and thus the neutral axis) lies closer to the flange (top) than to the bottom of the web (stem).\n2.  **Distances to Extreme Fibers:** Consequently, the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme bottom fibers ($y_{bottom}$) will be greater than the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme top fibers ($y_{top}$). This is explicitly mentioned in RAG Chunk 4, which states that for an unsymmetrical T-beam, the neutral axis is not at its geometric mid-height, leading to different maximum bending stresses at the top and bottom extreme fibers.\n3.  **Maximum Stress Magnitude:** Since the magnitude of stress is proportional to $y$, the maximum magnitude of normal stress will occur at the fiber farthest from the neutral axis. Given that $y_{bottom} > y_{top}$ for a T-section, the maximum magnitude of the normal stress is realized at the bottom fibers of the cross-section.\n4.  **Bending Moment Direction:** The figure shows a positive (sagging) bending moment. This causes the top fibers to be in compression and the bottom fibers to be in tension. Therefore, the maximum magnitude of stress will be the maximum tensile stress occurring at the bottom fibers."

        "Step 2: Identify the Neutral Axis (NA). The neutral axis always passes through the centroid of the cross-section. For a T-shaped cross-section, the centroid is not at the geometric mid-height; it is shifted towards the flange (top).",
        "Analyze the T-section geometry. A T-shaped cross-section is unsymmetrical, meaning its centroid (and thus the neutral axis) will not be at the geometric center. For a T-section with the flange at the top, the neutral axis lies closer to the flange than to the bottom of the web. Identify the extreme fibers: the top of the flange and the bottom of the web.",

Since the magnitude of normal stress is directly proportional to the distance $y$ from the neutral axis ($\\sigma \\propto |y|$), the maximum magnitude of stress will occur at the fiber farthest from the neutral axis. As $y_{bottom} > y_{top}$ for a T-section, the maximum magnitude of normal stress is realized at the bottom fibers.",
        "Consider the bending moment direction. If the applied bending moment is positive (sagging), the top fibers are in compression and the bottom fibers are in tension. The maximum magnitude of stress will be the maximum tensile stress at the bottom fibers."

        "description": "For a specific T-section with given dimensions, one would calculate the exact location of the centroid ($y_{NA}$) using the method of composite areas. Then, calculate the moment of inertia ($I$) about the neutral axis using the parallel axis theorem. Finally, determine the exact distances $y_{top}$ and $y_{bottom}$ and apply the flexure formula ($\\sigma_x = \\frac{M \\cdot y}{I}$) to find the numerical stress values at the top and bottom to confirm which has the maximum magnitude.",
