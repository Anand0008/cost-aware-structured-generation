      "reasoning": "The problem requires finding the thickness 't' at which the column's failure load due to yielding is equal to its critical buckling load. We need to set the yielding load equal to the Euler buckling load.\n\n1.  **Yielding Load (P_y):**\n    The load at which the column material yields is given by the product of the yield stress ($\\sigma_y$) and the cross-sectional area (A).\n    $\\sigma_y = 120 \\text{ MPa} = 120 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    Area $A = w \\times t$\n    $P_y = \\sigma_y \\times A = 120 \\times w \\times t \\quad (1)$\n\n2.  **Euler Critical Buckling Load (P_cr):**\n    For a simply supported (pin-pin) column, the effective length factor $K = 1$. The effective length $L_e = K \\times L = 1 \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}$.\n    The Euler buckling formula is $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{L_e^2}$.\n    Young's Modulus $E = 70 \\text{ GPa} = 70 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n    For a rectangular cross-section $w \\times t$ with $t \\le w$, the column will buckle about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia. This occurs about the axis parallel to 'w', for which the moment of inertia is $I_{min} = \\frac{1}{12} w t^3$.\n    Substituting these values into Euler's formula:\n    $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times (70 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2) \\times (\\frac{1}{12} w t^3 \\text{ mm}^4)}{(1000 \\text{ mm})^2}$\n    $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times 10^3 \\times w t^3}{12 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times w t^3}{12000} \\quad (2)$\n\n3.  **Equating P_y and P_cr:**\n    To find the value of 't' where failure by yielding and buckling coincide, we set $P_y = P_{cr}$:\n    $120 \\times w \\times t = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times w t^3}{12000}$\n\n4.  **Solve for t:**\n    Divide both sides by $w \\times t$ (assuming $w, t \\neq 0$):\n    $120 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 70 \\times t^2}{12000}$\n    Rearrange to solve for $t^2$:\n    $t^2 = \\frac{120 \\times 12000}{\\pi^2 \\times 70}$\n    $t^2 = \\frac{1440000}{690.872}$\n    $t^2 \\approx 2084.28 \\text{ mm}^2$\n    $t = \\sqrt{2084.28} \\approx 45.654 \\text{ mm}$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, $t \\approx 45.66 \\text{ mm}$.

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters, material properties, and potential failure modes. Convert all units to a consistent system (e.g., N and mm or Pa and m). Given: $L = 1 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}$, $E = 70 \\text{ GPa} = 70 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $\\sigma_y = 120 \\text{ MPa} = 120 \\text{ N/mm}^2$. The column is simply supported (pin-pin), so the effective length factor $K=1$. The cross-section is rectangular $w \\times t$ with $t \\le w$. The two failure modes are material yielding in compression and Euler elastic buckling.",
        "Step 2: Formulate the failure loads for both modes. The yielding load is $P_y = \\sigma_y A = \\sigma_y (w \\times t)$. The Euler critical buckling load for a simply supported column is $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{L_e^2}$, where $L_e = K L = 1 \\times L = L$.",
        "Step 3: Determine the minimum moment of inertia ($I_{min}$) for the rectangular cross-section. For a rectangular section $w \\times t$ with $t \\le w$, the buckling will occur about the weaker axis, which has $I_{min} = \\frac{w t^3}{12}$. Substitute this into the Euler buckling load formula: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E (w t^3/12)}{L^2}$.",
        "Step 4: Equate the yielding load ($P_y$) and the critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$) to find the condition where both failure modes coincide: $\\sigma_y (w t) = \\frac{\\pi^2 E (w t^3/12)}{L^2}$.",
        "Step 5: Simplify the equation by canceling $w$ (since $w \\ne 0$) and one power of $t$: $\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\pi^2 E t^2}{12 L^2}$. Rearrange to solve for $t^2$: $t^2 = \\frac{12 L^2 \\sigma_y}{\\pi^2 E}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula for $t^2$. Using consistent units (e.g., mm and N/mm$^2$): $L = 1000\\,\\text{mm}$, $\\sigma_y = 120\\,\\text{N/mm}^2$, $E = 70000\\,\\text{N/mm}^2$. $t^2 = \\frac{12 \\times (1000\\,\\text{mm})^2 \\times 120\\,\\text{N/mm}^2}{\\pi^2 \\times 70000\\,\\text{N/mm}^2} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^6 \\times 120}{\\pi^2 \\times 70000} \\approx 2079.9 \\text{ mm}^2$.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the final numerical value of $t$ by taking the square root: $t = \\sqrt{2079.9} \\approx 45.606 \\text{ mm}$. This value is approximately $45.6 \\text{ mm}$."
