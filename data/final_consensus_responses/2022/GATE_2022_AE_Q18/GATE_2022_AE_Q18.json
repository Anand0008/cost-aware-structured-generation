      "reasoning": "The service ceiling of an aircraft is defined as the altitude at which the maximum rate of climb is 100 ft/min. This is confirmed by retrieved knowledge, which states that the service ceiling represents the practical operational limit where the aircraft can still maintain a minimum climb rate, unlike the absolute ceiling where the rate of climb is 0 ft/min. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect due to using meters per minute instead of feet per minute. Option B describes the absolute ceiling, not the service ceiling. Option C is unrelated to the definition of service ceiling."
