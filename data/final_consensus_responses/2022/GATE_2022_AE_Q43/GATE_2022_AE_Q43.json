We need to analyze its continuity and differentiability for all $x$.\n\n1.  **Continuity for all x:**\n    The absolute value function $g(x) = |x|$ is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The sine function $h(u) = \\sin(u)$ is continuous for all $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The squaring function $k(v) = v^2$ is continuous for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Since $f(x)$ is a composition of these three continuous functions ($f(x) = k(h(g(x)))$), it is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Specifically, at $x=0$, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\sin^2(|x|) = \\sin^2(|0|) = \\sin^2(0) = 0$. Also, $f(0) = \\sin^2(|0|) = 0$. Since the limit equals the function value, $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.\n    Thus, the function is continuous for all $x$.\n\n2.  **Differentiability for all x:**\n    We can simplify the function $f(x) = \\sin^2(|x|)$.\n    *   For $x \\ge 0$, $|x| = x$, so $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$.\n    *   For $x < 0$, $|x| = -x$, so $f(x) = \\sin^2(-x)$.\n    Since $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)$ (sine is an odd function), we have $\\sin^2(-x) = (-\\sin(x))^2 = \\sin^2(x)$.\n    Therefore, $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n    Now, we find the derivative of $f(x) = \\sin^2(x)$ using the chain rule:\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin^2(x)) = 2\\sin(x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(x)) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$.\n    Using the trigonometric double angle identity, $2\\sin(x)\\cos(x) = \\sin(2x)$.\n    So, $f'(x) = \\sin(2x)$.\n\n    The derivative $f'(x) = \\sin(2x)$ is defined and continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since the derivative exists for all $x$, the function $f(x)$ is differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the function is both continuous and differentiable for all $x$. Therefore, the correct options are A and B."

Periodic functions like $\\sin^2(|x|)$ are commonly used to model physical phenomena such as waves, vibrations, and electromagnetic fields. For example, a continuous potential energy function implies a conservative force, and a differentiable position function allows for the calculation of instantaneous velocity.",
