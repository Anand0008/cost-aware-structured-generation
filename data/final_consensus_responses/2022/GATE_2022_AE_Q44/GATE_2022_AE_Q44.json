      "reasoning": "The question describes a convergent nozzle initially operating with choked flow at its exit (Q). The reservoir pressure ($P_0$) and temperature ($T_0$), as well as the ambient back pressure ($P_b$), remain constant. The exit area of the nozzle is increased.\n\n**Analysis for Option A (the nozzle will remain choked):**\nFor a convergent nozzle, choking occurs when the ratio of the back pressure ($P_b$) to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) is less than or equal to the critical pressure ratio ($P^*/P_0$). The critical pressure ratio is a constant value for a given gas (dependent only on $\\gamma$). Since both $P_0$ (reservoir pressure) and $P_b$ (ambient pressure) are stated to remain constant, the pressure ratio $P_b/P_0$ does not change. As the nozzle was initially choked, this condition ($P_b/P_0 \\le P^*/P_0$) will continue to be satisfied. Therefore, the flow at the nozzle exit (Q) will remain sonic ($M_Q = 1$), and the nozzle will remain choked. Option A is correct.\n\n**Analysis for Option C (the Mach number at section P will increase):**\nSection P is located upstream of the nozzle exit (Q). In a convergent nozzle, the exit is also the throat, where the flow becomes sonic when choked. Let the initial exit area be $A_{exit,1} = A^*_1$. When the exit area is increased, the new exit area becomes $A_{exit,2} = A^*_2$, where $A^*_2 > A^*_1$. The area at section P, $A_P$, is a fixed physical area.\n\nThe Mach number at section P ($M_P$) is related to the area ratio $A_P/A^*$ by the isentropic area-Mach number relation:\n$\\frac{A_P}{A^*} = \\frac{1}{M_P} \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_P^2 \\right) \\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$\n\nSince $A_P$ is constant and $A^*_2 > A^*_1$, the new area ratio $A_P/A^*_2$ is smaller than the initial area ratio $A_P/A^*_1$. For subsonic flow ($M_P < 1$, which is true for section P in a choked convergent nozzle), the area ratio $A/A^*$ is a decreasing function of Mach number $M$. This means that as $A/A^*$ decreases, $M$ increases. Therefore, since $A_P/A^*$ has decreased, the Mach number at section P ($M_P$) must increase. Option C is correct."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the initial state and nozzle type. The problem describes a convergent nozzle fed from a constant pressure ($P_0$) and temperature ($T_0$) reservoir, discharging to atmosphere ($P_b = 1$ bar). The flow is choked at its exit (Q), meaning the Mach number at the exit, $M_Q$, is 1. For a convergent nozzle, the exit acts as its throat ($A^*$). The flow upstream at section P is subsonic.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the choking condition. Choking in a convergent nozzle depends on the ratio of the back pressure ($P_b$) to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$). If $P_b/P_0$ is less than or equal to the critical pressure ratio ($P^*/P_0$), the nozzle remains choked. The critical pressure ratio is constant for a given gas ($\\gamma$). Since $P_0$ and $P_b$ remain constant, the pressure ratio $P_b/P_0$ remains unchanged. Therefore, the nozzle will continue to operate in a choked state (Option A is correct).",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change in nozzle geometry. The exit area of the convergent nozzle is increased. Since the exit of a convergent nozzle is its throat, this means the throat area ($A^*$) has increased.",
        "Step 4: Determine the effect on mass flow rate. The choked mass flow rate through a nozzle is given by $\\dot{m} \\propto P_0 A^* / \\sqrt{T_0}$. Since $P_0$ and $T_0$ are constant, and the throat area ($A^*$) has increased, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) through the nozzle will increase.",
        "Step 5: Apply the Isentropic Area-Mach Number Relation for section P. Section P is upstream of the throat, so the flow at P is subsonic ($M_P < 1$). The Mach number at P is related to the local area $A_P$ and the sonic throat area $A^*$ by the relation: $\\frac{A_P}{A^*} = \\frac{1}{M_P} \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_P^2 \\right) \\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate the Mach number at P. The area at section P ($A_P$) is fixed. As the throat area ($A^*$) has increased (from Step 3), the ratio $A_P/A^*$ has decreased. For subsonic flow ($M < 1$), the function $A/A^*$ decreases as $M$ increases (i.e., as M approaches 1). Therefore, a decrease in $A_P/A^*$ implies an increase in the Mach number at section P ($M_P$) (Option C is correct).",

Incorrect predictions of flow behavior due to geometry changes can lead to suboptimal engine performance, reduced fuel efficiency, engine instability, or structural issues due to unexpected pressure distributions and loss of thrust."

For Mach number changes, consider the $A/A^*$ vs. $M$ curve for subsonic flow. Remember that for fixed reservoir conditions, choking persists, and for an interior point in a convergent nozzle, an increase in throat area (exit area) will lead to an increase in Mach number at that point.",

For a choked convergent nozzle, the throat is at $M=1$ (where $A/A^*=1$). If the exit area increases, the new $A_{exit}/A^*$ will be greater than 1, and the corresponding subsonic Mach number at the exit can be found on the curve. This visual approach reinforces that choking persists at the throat and helps understand Mach number changes upstream.",
