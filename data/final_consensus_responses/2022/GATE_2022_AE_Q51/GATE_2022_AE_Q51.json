      "reasoning": "The total lift (L) generated by a finite wing is calculated by integrating the lift per unit span (L') over the entire wingspan. According to the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, the lift per unit span is given by: $L'(y) = \\rho U_\\infty \\Gamma(y)$. Therefore, the total lift is $L = \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} L'(y) dy = \\rho U_\\infty \\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy$. The given circulation distribution is piecewise linear and symmetric: $\\Gamma(y) = \\Gamma_0 (1 - 2y/b)$ for $0 \\le y \\le b/2$ and $\\Gamma(y) = \\Gamma_0 (1 + 2y/b)$ for $-b/2 \\le y \\le 0$. This distribution forms a triangle with its peak at $y=0$ (where $\\Gamma(0) = \\Gamma_0$) and zero circulation at the wingtips ($y = \\pm b/2$). The integral $\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy$ represents the area under this triangular circulation distribution. The area of this triangle is $(1/2) \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = (1/2) \\times b \\times \\Gamma_0$. Alternatively, by integrating: Due to symmetry, $\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\Gamma(y) dy = 2 \\int_0^{b/2} \\Gamma_0 (1 - 2y/b) dy = 2\\Gamma_0 [y - y^2/b]_0^{b/2} = 2\\Gamma_0 (b/2 - (b/2)^2/b) = 2\\Gamma_0 (b/2 - b/4) = 2\\Gamma_0 (b/4) = \\Gamma_0 b/2$. Substituting this into the total lift formula: $L = \\rho U_\\infty (\\Gamma_0 b/2)$. Given values are: $\\rho = 1.2 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $U_\\infty = 80 \\text{ m/s}$, $b = 10 \\text{ m}$, and $\\Gamma_0 = 20 \\text{ m}^2/s$. Plugging these values: $L = 1.2 \\times 80 \\times (20 \\times 10 / 2) = 1.2 \\times 80 \\times 100 = 9600 \\text{ N}$. The result is 9600 N, which is an integer and matches the expected answer."
