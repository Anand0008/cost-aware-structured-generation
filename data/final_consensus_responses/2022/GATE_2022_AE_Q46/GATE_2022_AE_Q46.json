      "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n*   **Statement A & B (Trajectory Equation):** The general equation for a conic section (orbit) in polar coordinates, with the central body at the origin, is given by $r = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(\\theta - C)}$, where $r$ is the radial distance, $p$ is the semi-latus rectum (or parameter of the orbit), $e$ is the eccentricity, $\\theta$ is the true anomaly, and $C$ is the phase angle. The question states that the phase angle $C=0$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to $r = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}$.\n    For a two-body problem, the semi-latus rectum $p$ is related to the specific angular momentum $h$ and the gravitational parameter $\\mu = GM$ by the formula $p = \\frac{h^2}{\\mu} = \\frac{h^2}{GM}$.\n    Substituting this expression for $p$ into the trajectory equation, we get $r = \\frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta)}$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   Option A: $r = |h| / (GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta))$ is incorrect because the numerator should be $h^2$.\n    *   Option B: $r = |h|^2 / (GM(1 + e \\cos \\theta))$ is correct, as $|h|^2 = h^2$.\n\n*   **Statement C (h is conserved):** In a two-body system under the influence of a central gravitational force, the specific angular momentum ($h$, angular momentum per unit mass) of the orbiting body is a conserved quantity. This is a direct consequence of the gravitational force being a central force, which means it produces no torque about the center of mass.\n\n*   **Statement D (The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy of the satellite is conserved):** For a satellite orbiting under a central gravitational force, and in the absence of any non-conservative forces (such as atmospheric drag or thrust), the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) of the satellite is conserved. This is a fundamental principle in conservative force fields.\n\nTherefore, statements B, C, and D are true."

        "description": "Instead of directly recalling the formula for $p$, one can derive the trajectory equation from Newton's second law in polar coordinates, combined with the conservation of angular momentum. This involves starting from the equation of motion under gravity in polar coordinates, deriving conservation of angular momentum from the $\\theta$-equation, then using the radial equation and substitution $u = 1/r$ to obtain the differential equation $\\dfrac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2} + u = \\dfrac{\\mu}{h^2}$ and solving it to get $u = \\dfrac{1}{p}(1 + e\\cos\\theta)$, hence $r = p/(1 + e\\cos\\theta)$ with $p = h^2/\\mu$.",
