This is a fundamental characteristic of Fanno flow, which represents the locus of all possible thermodynamic states for one-dimensional, steady, adiabatic flow with friction in a constant-area duct. As the flow progresses along the duct, friction causes the entropy to increase, driving the flow state along the Fanno curve towards the point of maximum entropy, which occurs at the sonic condition (M=1). This is consistent across various sources, including Prof. V. Babu's video lectures and E. Rathakrishnan's 'Gas Dynamics' book."
