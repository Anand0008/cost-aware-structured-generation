An approximation often used for thin-walled sections (neglecting `I_c,flange` and using `d = h_w/2`) would yield `2800` mm$^4$, which also falls within the range."

        "Calculate the second moment of area for the web: The web is a rectangle of width t = 0.6 mm and height H = 20 mm. Its centroid coincides with the overall centroidal axis. Thus, I_web = (t * H^3) / 12.",
        "Calculate the second moment of area for the flanges using the parallel axis theorem and the thin-walled approximation: Each flange is a rectangle of width B = 20 mm and thickness t = 0.6 mm. Its area is A_flange = B * t. For thin-walled sections, the moment of inertia of a flange about its own centroidal axis is negligible. The distance from the centroid of a flange to the overall centroidal axis is approximately d = H / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 mm. Therefore, each flange contributes A_flange * d^2.",
        "Sum the contributions: The total second moment of area I_xx is the sum of the web's contribution and the contributions from the two flanges: I_xx = I_web + 2 * (A_flange * d^2).",

        "industry_example": "The main wing spar of a commercial aircraft (e.g., Boeing 747) is often designed as an I-section, made from aluminum or composite, to maximize bending resistance while minimizing weight. Accurately calculating its second moment of area is crucial for determining its load-carrying capacity and predicting wing bending deflection under lift loads.",
        "why_it_matters": "Underestimating the second moment of area (I_xx) could lead to excessive bending stresses, deflections, potential failure, and unsafe design. Overestimating it results in an unnecessarily heavy, expensive structure and adds unnecessary weight."
