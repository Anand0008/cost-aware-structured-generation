The fundamental relationship between bank angle (\\phi), velocity (V), turn radius (R), and gravity (g) is $\\tan(\\phi) = V^2 / (g R)$. Substituting V = 100 m/s, g = 10 m/s^2, R = 1000 m gives $\\tan(\\phi) = 1$, so $\\phi = 45^\\circ$. This matches the provided answer key range of 44-46 degrees. The aircraft mass is given but not needed for this calculation, as the formula is independent of mass."

        "Step 2: For a level coordinated turn, the forces are balanced. The vertical component of lift ($L \\cos(\\phi)$) balances the aircraft's weight ($W = mg$), and the horizontal component of lift ($L \\sin(\\phi)$) provides the necessary centripetal force ($m V^2 / R$).",
        "Step 3: Write the force balance equations:\nVertical: $L \\cos(\\phi) = W = mg$\nHorizontal: $L \\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{m V^2}{R}$",
        "Step 4: Divide the horizontal force balance equation by the vertical force balance equation to eliminate lift ($L$) and mass ($m$):\n$\\frac{L \\sin(\\phi)}{L \\cos(\\phi)} = \\frac{m V^2 / R}{mg}$\nThis simplifies to $\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{V^2}{gR}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n$\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{(100 \\text{ m/s})^2}{(10 \\text{ m/s}^2)(1000 \\text{ m})}$",
        "Step 6: Perform the calculation:\n$\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{10000}{10000} = 1$.",
