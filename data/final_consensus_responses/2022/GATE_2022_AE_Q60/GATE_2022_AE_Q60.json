      "reasoning": "The problem involves an eccentrically applied axial load, which induces both direct axial stress and bending stress. The total normal stress at any point on the cross-section is the superposition of these two stresses.\n\n1.  **Calculate cross-sectional properties:**\n    *   Side length `b = 1 cm = 10 mm = 0.01 m`.\n    *   Cross-sectional area `A = b^2 = (0.01 \\text{ m})^2 = 100 \\text{ mm}^2 = 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2`.\n    *   Moment of inertia `I = b^4 / 12 = (0.01 \\text{ m})^4 / 12 = 8.333 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4`.\n    *   Distance from neutral axis to outer fiber `y_{max} = b / 2 = 0.01 \\text{ m} / 2 = 5 \\text{ mm} = 0.005 \\text{ m}`.\n\n2.  **Define stress components:**\n    *   Axial load `P = 10 \\text{ kN} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}`.\n    *   Axial stress `$\\sigma_a = P / A = (10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}) / (10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2) = 100 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa} = 100 \\text{ MPa}$` (tensile).\n    *   Bending moment `M = P \\times e`.\n    *   Bending stress `$\\sigma_b = (M \\times y) / I = (P \\times e \\times y) / I$`.\n\n3.  **Superposition of stresses and strains:** The total normal stress `$\\sigma_x = \\sigma_a \\pm \\sigma_b$`. The sign of `$\\sigma_b$` depends on the direction of eccentricity `e` and the position `y`.\n    Given `$\\epsilon_1 = 0.0016$` (top surface) and `$\\epsilon_2 = 0.0004$` (bottom surface), both are positive, indicating tensile strains. Since the axial stress `$\\sigma_a$` is tensile, the bending stress must contribute to tension on the top surface and reduce tension on the bottom surface. This implies the eccentricity `e` is such that it causes tension on the top surface (where `y = +y_{max}`) and compression (or reduced tension) on the bottom surface (where `y = -y_{max}`).\n\n    Therefore, the stress equations are:\n    *   Top surface (`y = +y_{max}`): `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_a + (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$`\n    *   Bottom surface (`y = -y_{max}`): `$\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_a - (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$`\n\n    Using Hooke's Law, `$\\epsilon = \\sigma / E$`:\n    *   `$E \\times \\epsilon_1 = P/A + (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$` (Equation 1)\n    *   `$E \\times \\epsilon_2 = P/A - (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$` (Equation 2)\n\n4.  **Solve for `e`:**\n    Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n    `$E \\times (\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2) = 2 \\times (P/A)$`\n    `$E \\times (0.0016 + 0.0004) = 2 \\times (100 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa})$`\n    `$E \\times 0.0020 = 200 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}$`\n    `$E = (200 \\times 10^6) / 0.0020 = 100 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa} = 100 \\text{ GPa}$`.\n\n    Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n    `$E \\times (\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2) = 2 \\times (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$`\n    `$E \\times (0.0016 - 0.0004) = 2 \\times (P \\times e \\times y_{max}) / I$`\n    `$100 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa} \\times 0.0012 = 2 \\times (10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N} \\times e \\times 0.005 \\text{ m}) / (8.333 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4)$`\n    `$1.2 \\times 10^8 = (100 \\times e) / (8.333 \\times 10^{-10})$`\n    `$e = (1.2 \\times 10^8 \\times 8.333 \\times 10^{-10}) / 100$`\n    `$e = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} = 1.0 \\text{ mm}$`.\n\n    The eccentricity `e` is `1.0 mm`."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify the given information and calculate cross-sectional properties. Axial load P = 10 kN = 10^4 N. Square cross-section 1 cm x 1 cm, so side length b = h = 0.01 m. Cross-sectional area A = b^2 = (0.01 m)^2 = 10^-4 m^2. Moment of inertia I = b h^3 / 12 = (0.01)^4 / 12 = 8.3333 x 10^-10 m^4. Distance from neutral axis to outer fiber y = h/2 = 0.005 m. Measured strains: \\epsilon_1 = 0.0016 (top surface), \\epsilon_2 = 0.0004 (bottom surface). The distance of strain gauges from the tip (0.5 m) is irrelevant for the stress calculation.",
        "Recognize that an eccentric axial load P is equivalent to a concentric axial load P and a bending moment M = P * e, where e is the eccentricity. This combined loading results in both axial and bending stresses.",
        "Write the general formula for normal stress (\\sigma) at a distance y from the neutral axis due to combined axial and bending loads: \\sigma = P/A \\pm (M y)/I. Substituting M = P * e, the formula becomes \\sigma = P/A \\pm (P e y)/I. The sign depends on the location relative to the neutral axis and the direction of eccentricity.",
        "Apply Hooke's Law, \\sigma = E \\epsilon, to relate stress and strain. Thus, the strain at any point is \\epsilon = \\sigma/E = (P/(AE)) \\pm (P e y)/(EI). For the top surface (y = +0.005 m) and bottom surface (y = -0.005 m), the strain equations are: \\epsilon_1 = P/(AE) + (P e y)/(EI) and \\epsilon_2 = P/(AE) - (P e y)/(EI).",
        "Substitute the given strain values into the equations: E * 0.0016 = P/A + (P e y)/I and E * 0.0004 = P/A - (P e y)/I. This forms a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (E and e).",
        "Solve the system of equations. Add the two equations: E * (0.0016 + 0.0004) = 2 * (P/A). This simplifies to E * 0.0020 = 2 * (10^4 N / 10^-4 m^2) = 2 * 10^8 Pa. So, E = (2 * 10^8) / 0.0020 = 10^11 Pa = 100 GPa. Subtract the second equation from the first: E * (0.0016 - 0.0004) = 2 * (P e y)/I. This simplifies to E * 0.0012 = 2 * (P e y)/I.",
        "Substitute the calculated value of E into the difference equation: 10^11 * 0.0012 = 2 * (10^4 * e * 0.005) / (8.3333 x 10^-10). This gives 1.2 x 10^8 = (100 * e) / (8.3333 x 10^-10). Solving for e: e = (1.2 x 10^8 * 8.3333 x 10^-10) / 100 = 1.0 x 10^-3 m.",
