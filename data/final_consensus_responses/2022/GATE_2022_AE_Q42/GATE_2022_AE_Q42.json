      "reasoning": "The question asks which statement is NOT always true for a combustion process in a closed system. According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass and the total number of atoms of each element (and thus the total number of all atoms) are always conserved in any chemical reaction, including combustion, within a closed system. Therefore, statements regarding the conservation of total mass, total number of atoms, and total number of atoms of each element are always true. However, the total number of molecules (or moles) is generally NOT conserved during a chemical reaction because molecules are rearranged, dissociated, or combined to form new molecules. For example, in the reaction $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$, three reactant molecules combine to form two product molecules, demonstrating a change in the total number of molecules. Thus, the statement 'total number of molecules is conserved' is not always true."

This example clearly shows that the total number of molecules is not always conserved. Therefore, option B is the statement that is NOT always true.",
