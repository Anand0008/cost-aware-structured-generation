The tangential velocity component u_\\theta is given by u_\\theta = -2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta). The speed on the surface is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, |u_\\theta| = | -2 U_{\\text{inf}} \\sin(\\theta) | = 2 U_{\\text{inf}} |\\sin(\\theta)|. The maximum value of |\\sin(\\theta)| is 1, which occurs at \\theta = \\pi/2 and \\theta = 3\\pi/2 (the top and bottom points of the cylinder).
