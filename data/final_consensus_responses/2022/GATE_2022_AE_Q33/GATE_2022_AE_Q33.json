      "Finite Element Analysis (FEA)": "Stress transformation is implicitly performed in FEA software when results are presented in different coordinate systems or on element faces. Stress results from FEA are often in global coordinates; transformation is needed to get stresses in material directions. Understanding the underlying theory helps interpret FEA results.",
      "Machine Design": "Used extensively in machine design to ensure components (like shafts, gears, and brackets) can withstand complex stress states without yielding or fracturing.",
      "Aerospace Structures": "Crucial for the design and analysis of aircraft and spacecraft components, where complex loading leads to multi-axial stress states that need to be transformed to critical planes for safety assessment.",
