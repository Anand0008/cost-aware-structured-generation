      "reasoning": "In a composite circular shaft with perfectly bonded materials subjected to pure torsion, the displacement field must be continuous across the interface. This means that the angle of twist per unit length (dθ/dz) is the same for both materials. Consequently, the shear strain (γθz), which is directly proportional to the radial distance (r) and the angle of twist per unit length (γθz = r * (dθ/dz)), will be continuous across the steel-aluminum interface. However, shear stress (τθz) is related to shear strain by Hooke's Law for shear: τθz = G * γθz. Since steel and aluminum are different materials, they possess different shear moduli (G_steel ≠ G_aluminum). Given that shear strain is continuous but the shear modulus changes abruptly at the interface, the shear stress must exhibit a discontinuity (a jump) at the interface. Therefore, only shear strain is continuous across the interface."

        "Recall the fundamental assumptions for torsion in circular shafts: plane sections remain plane and rotate without warping. Due to perfect bonding, the tangential displacement and angle of twist per unit length (dθ/dz or dω/dz) are the same for both materials across the interface.",
        "Based on the kinematics and perfect bonding, the shear strain (γ_θz) at any radius r is given by γ_θz = r (dθ/dz). Since the angle of twist per unit length (dθ/dz) is uniform across the entire composite cross-section, the shear strain must be continuous across the interface.",
        "Next, consider shear stress continuity. Shear stress (τ_θz) is related to shear strain (γ_θz) by Hooke's Law for shear: τ_θz = G γ_θz, where G is the shear modulus. Steel and aluminum are different materials and thus have different shear moduli (G_steel ≠ G_aluminum).",
        "Since γ_θz is continuous at the interface, but G changes abruptly from G_steel to G_aluminum, the shear stress τ_θz must change abruptly (discontinuously) at the interface.",
