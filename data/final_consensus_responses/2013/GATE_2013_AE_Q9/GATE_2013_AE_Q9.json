      "reasoning": "The Phugoid mode is a long-period, lightly damped oscillation involving an exchange between kinetic and potential energy, leading to coupled variations in speed and altitude. The natural frequency of the Phugoid mode, $\\omega_{n_P}$, can be derived using approximations for steady, level flight and neglecting the change in lift coefficient with speed ($C_{L_u} \\approx 0$). The simplified formula for the Phugoid natural frequency is given by: $\\omega_{n_P} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1}$. From this formula, it is clear that the Phugoid natural frequency ($\\omega_{n_P}$) is inversely proportional to the equilibrium flight speed ($U_1$). As flight speed ($U_1$) increases, the Phugoid frequency ($\\omega_{n_P}$) decreases, resulting in a longer Phugoid period. Therefore, option B, 'Frequency is inversely proportional to flight speed', is the correct statement."

        "The Phugoid mode is a slow, long-period oscillation in aircraft longitudinal dynamics, characterized by coupled changes in speed and altitude, with minor changes in angle of attack. It involves an exchange between kinetic and potential energy.",
        "The natural frequency of the Phugoid mode, $\\omega_n_P$, can be derived from the longitudinal equations of motion and is generally given by $\\omega_n_P = \\sqrt{-\\frac{g \\cdot Z_u}{U1}}$.",
        "The vertical force derivative $Z_u$ is given by $Z_u = -\\frac{\\rho \\cdot U1 \\cdot S}{2 \\cdot m} \\cdot (C_{L_u} + 2 \\cdot C_{L_1})$. For simplification, we typically assume incompressible flow and neglect the change in lift coefficient with speed ($C_{L_u} \\approx 0$). Also, for steady level flight, Lift (L) equals Weight (W), i.e., $L = W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_1^2 S C_{L_1}$.",
        "Substituting these simplifications into the general formula, particularly $C_{L_u} \\approx 0$ and using the steady level flight condition to relate $C_{L_1}$ to $U_1$, leads to the simplified natural frequency of the Phugoid mode: $\\omega_{n_P} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1}$.",
        "From the simplified formula $\\omega_{n_P} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1}$, where $g$ is a constant, it is clear that the Phugoid natural frequency ($\\omega_{n_P}$) is inversely proportional to the equilibrium flight speed ($U_1$). As flight speed increases, the frequency decreases, and vice-versa. Therefore, the frequency of the Phugoid mode is inversely proportional to flight speed."

      "Aerodynamics": "The Phugoid mode is closely related to the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics, such as the lift coefficient and its variation with speed.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "The Phugoid mode is a fundamental longitudinal dynamic mode that affects the aircraft's overall stability and control.",
      "Control Systems": "The Phugoid mode, like other aircraft dynamic modes, can be modeled as a second-order system. Concepts like natural frequency and damping ratio are fundamental in control systems theory.",
      "Control Theory - Second Order Systems": "The Phugoid mode is modeled as a second-order transfer function. Its natural frequency and damping ratio are key performance specifications for aircraft handling qualities.",
      "Mathematics - Perturbation Theory": "The derivation of the simplified formula involves linearizing nonlinear equations of motion about an equilibrium point (steady flight), a key application of perturbation methods.",
      "Physics (Mechanics)": "The Phugoid oscillation fundamentally involves an exchange between kinetic energy (speed) and potential energy (altitude) under the influence of gravity.",
      "Physics - Simple Harmonic Motion": "The Phugoid can be approximated as a simple harmonic oscillator where the 'restoring force' arises from the interplay between gravity and lift variation with speed. The natural frequency formula is analogous to $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$."
