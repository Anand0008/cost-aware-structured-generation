The negative sign indicates that dihedral provides positive lateral stability, meaning a positive sideslip angle creates a negative (restoring) rolling moment. This formula is derived from strip theory, assuming a piecewise constant change in angle of attack due to sideslip on the left and right wings."

        "Step 2: Recall the approximate formula for the roll stability derivative $C_{l\\beta}$ due to dihedral for a rectangular wing. From aircraft stability theory, the contribution of dihedral to $C_{l\\beta}$ is given by: $C_{l\\beta} = -\\frac{c_{l\\alpha} \\Gamma}{4}$. It is crucial that the dihedral angle $\\Gamma$ is expressed in radians for consistency with the lift curve slope units.",
        "Step 3: Convert the dihedral angle from degrees to radians. Given $\\Gamma = 10^\\circ$, the conversion is: $\\Gamma_{\\text{rad}} = 10^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{18} \\approx 0.174532925 \\text{ radians}$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula. With $c_{l\\alpha} = 5.4 / \\text{rad}$ and $\\Gamma = 0.174532925 \\text{ rad}$, the formula becomes: $C_{l\\beta} = -\\frac{5.4 \\times 0.174532925}{4}$.",
        "Step 5: Perform the calculation. First, compute the product in the numerator: $5.4 \\times 0.174532925 = 0.942477795$. Then, divide by 4: $0.942477795 / 4 = 0.23561944875$. Therefore, $C_{l\\beta} = -0.23561944875$.",
        "Step 6: Round the result and verify its sign. Rounding to three decimal places, $C_{l\\beta} \\approx -0.236$ per radian. The negative sign indicates a stabilizing dihedral effect, which is expected for positive dihedral, contributing to positive lateral static stability.",

      "Aerodynamics": "The concept of lift curve slope (c_l_alpha) and how lift changes with angle of attack is fundamental. Strip theory, which uses 2D airfoil data, and small-angle aerodynamics are applied to relate angle changes to lift changes and derive the dihedral effect.",
      "Mathematics": "Basic trigonometry is essential for angle conversions. Understanding derivatives is key for stability analysis, and integration of functions (e.g., over symmetric limits for rolling moment) is used in derivations. Unit conversion is also critical.",
      "Aircraft Design": "Dihedral is a critical geometric parameter chosen during the conceptual and preliminary design phases to meet stability requirements.",
      "Control Systems": "C_{l\\beta} is a key parameter in the lateral-directional state-space model used for dynamic stability and control law design.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "The roll stability derivative C_l\\beta is a key parameter in the overall lateral stability analysis of an aircraft.",
      "Space Dynamics": "Analogous stability derivatives exist for spacecraft attitude dynamics when using aerodynamic surfaces in upper atmosphere flight.",
      "Structures": "Wing dihedral angle is implemented structurally through wing geometry and spar design; structural stiffness must support the chosen dihedral without excessive deformation."
