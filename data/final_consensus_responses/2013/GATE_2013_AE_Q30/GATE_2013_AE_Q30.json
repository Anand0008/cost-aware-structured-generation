The maximum L/D ratio can be calculated from the zero-lift drag coefficient ($C_{D0}$), aspect ratio ($AR$), and Oswald efficiency factor ($e$). Once $(L/D)_{max}$ is found, the maximum range ($R_{max}$) is simply the product of the initial altitude ($h$) and $(L/D)_{max}$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the induced drag factor (K):** The drag polar is given by $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, where $K = \\frac{1}{\\pi e AR}$.\n    $K = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\times 0.95 \\times 10} = \\frac{1}{9.5\\pi} \\approx 0.033506$\n\n2.  **Determine the lift coefficient ($C_L$) for maximum L/D:** For maximum L/D, the parasite drag equals the induced drag, i.e., $C_{D0} = K C_L^2$. Therefore, $C_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{D0}}{K}}$.\n    $C_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{0.033506}} = \\sqrt{0.5969} \\approx 0.7726$\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum lift-to-drag ratio ($(L/D)_{max}$):** Using the direct formula $(L/D)_{max} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi e AR C_{D0}}}{2 C_{D0}}$.\n    $(L/D)_{max} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.95 \\times 10 \\times 0.02}}{2 \\times 0.02} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.5969}}{0.04} \\approx \\frac{0.7726}{0.04} \\approx 19.315$\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum range ($R_{max}$):** The maximum range in gliding flight is given by $R_{max} = h \\times (L/D)_{max}$.\n    $R_{max} = 500 \\text{ m} \\times 19.315 = 9657.5 \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Convert the range to kilometers:**\n    $R_{max} = 9657.5 \\text{ m} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{1000 \\text{ m}} = 9.6575 \\text{ km}$\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 9.66 km falls within the specified range of 9 to 10 km."
