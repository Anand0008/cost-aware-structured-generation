      "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency for a jet engine is ideally maximized when the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) is equal to the flight velocity ($V_a$). This minimizes the kinetic energy loss in the wake. The formula for propulsive efficiency, $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_e + V_a}$ (for perfectly expanded flow), clearly shows that $\\eta_p$ approaches 1 as $V_e$ approaches $V_a$. The problem asks for the highest propulsive efficiency among the given options, which means finding the option where $V_e$ is closest to $V_a$.\n\nFirst, calculate the flight velocity $V_a$:\n1.  **Gas constant for exhaust gases ($R_g$):**\n    $R_g = \\frac{R_u}{MW} = \\frac{8314 \\text{ J/kmol-K}}{29 \\text{ kg/kmol}} = 286.6896 \\text{ J/kg-K}$\n2.  **Ambient speed of sound ($a_a$):**\n    $a_a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R_g T_a} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 286.6896 \\text{ J/kg-K} \\times 250 \\text{ K}} = \\sqrt{100341.36} \\approx 316.766 \\text{ m/s}$\n3.  **Flight velocity ($V_a$):**\n    $V_a = M_a \\times a_a = 1.5 \\times 316.766 \\text{ m/s} \\approx 475.149 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nNext, calculate the exhaust velocity $V_e$ for each given nozzle exit Mach number $M_e$, using the isentropic flow relations. The general formula for exhaust velocity from stagnation conditions is:\n$V_e = M_e a_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R_g T_e}$, where $T_e = \\frac{T_{0e}}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_e^2}$.\nCombining these, we get:\n$V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma R_g T_{0e}}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_e^2}}$\nGiven $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R_g = 286.6896 \\text{ J/kg-K}$, $T_{0e} = 800 \\text{ K}$:\n$V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\frac{1.4 \\times 286.6896 \\times 800}{1 + \\frac{1.4 - 1}{2} M_e^2}} = M_e \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.2 M_e^2}}$\n\nNow, evaluate $V_e$ for each option and compare with $V_a = 475.149 \\text{ m/s}$:\n*   **Option A: $M_e = 1$**\n    $V_e = 1 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.2 \\times 1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1.2}} = \\sqrt{267576.96} \\approx 517.278 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $|V_e - V_a| = |517.278 - 475.149| = 42.129 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   **Option B: $M_e = 1.5$**\n    $V_e = 1.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.2 \\times 1.5^2}} = 1.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.45}} = 1.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1.45}} \\approx 1.5 \\times 470.576 \\approx 705.864 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $|V_e - V_a| = |705.864 - 475.149| = 230.715 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   **Option C: $M_e = 2$**\n    $V_e = 2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.2 \\times 2^2}} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.8}} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1.8}} \\approx 2 \\times 422.353 \\approx 844.706 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $|V_e - V_a| = |844.706 - 475.149| = 369.557 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   **Option D: $M_e = 2.5$**\n    $V_e = 2.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 0.2 \\times 2.5^2}} = 2.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{1 + 1.25}} = 2.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{321092.35}{2.25}} \\approx 2.5 \\times 377.773 \\approx 944.433 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $|V_e - V_a| = |944.433 - 475.149| = 469.284 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nComparing the absolute differences, the smallest difference between $V_e$ and $V_a$ occurs for $M_e = 1$ ($42.129 \\text{ m/s}$).

        "Understand the principle of propulsive efficiency for a jet engine, which is ideally maximized when the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) is as close as possible to the flight velocity ($V_a$). The formula for propulsive efficiency (neglecting pressure thrust) is $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_e + V_a}$.",
        "Calculate the flight velocity ($V_a$). Given flight Mach number ($M_a = 1.5$), ambient temperature ($T_a = 250 K$), $\\gamma = 1.4$, and gas constant ($R = 8314/29 \\approx 287 J/(kg\\cdot K)$). First, calculate the ambient speed of sound ($a_a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$), then $V_a = M_a \\cdot a_a$.",
        "For each given nozzle exit Mach number ($M_e$), calculate the corresponding exhaust velocity ($V_e$). This requires using the isentropic temperature relation ($T_e = T_{0g} / (1 + (\\gamma-1)/2 \\cdot M_e^2)$) to find the exit static temperature ($T_e$) from the stagnation temperature ($T_{0g} = 800 K$). Then, calculate $V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.",
        "Calculate the propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) for each exit Mach number using the formula $\\eta_p = \\frac{2 V_a}{V_e + V_a}$.",
        "Compare the calculated propulsive efficiencies for all given exit Mach numbers. The exit Mach number that yields the highest propulsive efficiency is the answer.",
        "Theoretically, for a choked, under-expanded nozzle, the maximum propulsive efficiency is often achieved when the exhaust velocity is matched to the flight velocity, which typically corresponds to an exit Mach number of 1 for optimal expansion. Higher exit Mach numbers lead to increased kinetic energy loss and lower efficiency."
