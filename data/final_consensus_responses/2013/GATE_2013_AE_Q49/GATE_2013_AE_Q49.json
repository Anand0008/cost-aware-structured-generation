      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the minimum and maximum speeds of an airplane in level flight at sea-level.\n\n**1. Minimum Speed (Stall Speed):**\nIn steady, unaccelerated level flight, the lift ($L$) must equal the weight ($W$). The minimum speed an aircraft can fly at is its stall speed ($V_{stall}$), which occurs when the lift coefficient ($C_L$) reaches its maximum value ($C_{Lmax}$). The lift equation is:\n$L = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_L$\nFor level flight, $L = W$. So, $W = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V_{stall}^2 S C_{Lmax}$.\nRearranging for $V_{stall}$:\n$V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty S C_{Lmax}}}$\nGiven:\n$W = 30 \\text{ kN} = 30000 \\text{ N}$\n$\\rho_\\infty = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$S = 30 \\text{ m}^2$\n$C_{Lmax} = 1.4$\nSubstituting these values:\n$V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 30000}{1.22 \\times 30 \\times 1.4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{60000}{51.24}} \\approx \\sqrt{1170.96} \\approx 34.22 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**2. Maximum Speed:**\nFor maximum speed in level flight, the thrust available ($T_0$) must equal the drag ($D$).\n$T_0 = D$\nThe drag equation is:\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S C_D$\nThe drag coefficient is given by the drag polar: $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, where $C_{D0} = 0.015$ and $K = 0.024$.\nIn level flight, $L = W$, so we can express $C_L$ in terms of $V$:\n$C_L = \\frac{W}{0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty V^2 S}$\nSubstitute $C_L$ into the drag polar:\n$C_D = C_{D0} + K \\left(\\frac{2W}{\\rho_\\infty V^2 S}\\right)^2 = C_{D0} + \\frac{4 K W^2}{(\\rho_\\infty S)^2 V^4}$\nNow substitute this $C_D$ into the drag equation:\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V^2 S \\left(C_{D0} + \\frac{4 K W^2}{(\\rho_\\infty S)^2 V^4}\\right)$\n$D = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0} V^2 + \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S V^2}$\nSet $T_0 = D$:\n$T_0 = (0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0}) V^2 + \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S V^2}$\nLet's calculate the coefficients:\n$A = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty S C_{D0} = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times 30 \\times 0.015 = 0.2745$\n$B = \\frac{2 K W^2}{\\rho_\\infty S} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.024 \\times (30000)^2}{1.22 \\times 30} = \\frac{0.048 \\times 900,000,000}{36.6} \\approx 1,180,327.87$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$4000 = 0.2745 V^2 + \\frac{1,180,327.87}{V^2}$\nMultiply by $V^2$ to get a quadratic equation in $V^2$ (let $X = V^2$):\n$0.2745 (V^2)^2 - 4000 (V^2) + 1,180,327.87 = 0$\n$0.2745 X^2 - 4000 X + 1,180,327.87 = 0$\nUsing the quadratic formula $X = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4000)^2 - 4 \\times 0.2745 \\times 1,180,327.87}}{2 \\times 0.2745}$\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{16,000,000 - 1,296,000.003}}{0.549}$\n$X = \\frac{4000 \\pm \\sqrt{14,703,999.997}}{0.549} \\approx \\frac{4000 \\pm 3834.58}{0.549}$\nTwo solutions for $X = V^2$:\n$X_1 = \\frac{4000 + 3834.58}{0.549} = \\frac{7834.58}{0.549} \\approx 14270.64 \\text{ m}^2/s^2$\n$V_{max} = \\sqrt{14270.64} \\approx 119.46 \\text{ m/s}$\n$X_2 = \\frac{4000 - 3834.58}{0.549} = \\frac{165.42}{0.549} \\approx 301.31 \\text{ m}^2/s^2$\n$V_{min, T=D} = \\sqrt{301.31} \\approx 17.36 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**3. Final Minimum and Maximum Speeds:**\nThe minimum speed for level flight is the higher of the stall speed ($V_{stall}$) and the lower speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equation ($V_{min, T=D}$). This is because an aircraft cannot fly below its stall speed, even if it has enough thrust.\nMinimum speed = $\\max(V_{stall}, V_{min, T=D}) = \\max(34.22 \\text{ m/s}, 17.36 \\text{ m/s}) = 34.22 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThe maximum speed is the higher speed obtained from the thrust-equals-drag equation:\nMaximum speed = $119.46 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nThus, the minimum and maximum speeds are $34.22 \\text{ m/s}$ and $119.46 \\text{ m/s}$ respectively, which corresponds to Option C."

        "Step 1: Identify the given data: weight W = 30 kN, thrust available at sea-level T₀ = 4000 N, wing planform area S = 30 m², maximum lift coefficient CL_max = 1.4, and drag coefficient CD = 0.015 + 0.024 CL². Recall that in steady level flight, lift equals weight (L = W) and thrust equals drag (T = D). The minimum speed is constrained by stall, occurring at maximum lift coefficient CL_max.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the minimum speed (stall speed) V_min using the lift equation: L = W = 0.5 ρ V_min² S CL_max. Rearranging for V_min gives V_min = √(2W / (ρ S CL_max)). Substitute the values: W = 30000 N, ρ = 1.22 kg/m³ (standard sea-level density), S = 30 m², CL_max = 1.4. This yields V_min ≈ 34.22 m/s.",
        "Step 3: For maximum speed, the thrust available T₀ must equal the drag D. The drag equation is D = 0.5 ρ V² S CD. The drag coefficient CD is given by the drag polar: CD = 0.015 + 0.024 CL².",
        "Step 4: In level flight, L = W, so the lift coefficient CL can be expressed as CL = 2W / (ρ V² S). Substitute this expression for CL into the drag polar to get CD as a function of V: CD(V) = 0.015 + 0.024 (2W / (ρ V² S))².",
        "Step 5: Substitute CD(V) into the drag equation D = 0.5 ρ V² S CD(V) and set D = T₀. This results in the equation: T₀ = 0.5 ρ S (0.015) V² + 0.5 ρ S (0.024) (2W / (ρ S))² / V². Plugging in numerical values (T₀ = 4000 N, W = 30000 N, ρ = 1.22 kg/m³, S = 30 m²), the equation becomes approximately: 0.2745 V² + 1180328 / V² = 4000.",
        "Step 6: Multiply the equation by V² and rearrange it into a quadratic form for V²: 0.2745 V⁴ - 4000 V² + 1180328 = 0. Using the quadratic formula to solve for V², we get two roots: V² ≈ 14271 and V² ≈ 301.3.",
        "Step 7: Take the square root of these values to find the corresponding velocities: V ≈ 119.46 m/s and V ≈ 17.36 m/s. The lower speed (17.36 m/s) is below the stall speed (34.22 m/s) and would require a lift coefficient greater than CL_max, which is not possible. Therefore, the maximum speed V_max is 119.46 m/s.",
        "Step 8: The minimum speed for level flight is 34.22 m/s and the maximum speed is 119.46 m/s. These values match the given options."
