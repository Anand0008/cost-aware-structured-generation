      "reasoning": "The problem requires finding values of `a`, `b`, and `c` such that the given matrix `Q` is orthonormal. An orthonormal matrix (or orthogonal matrix for real entries) has column vectors that form an orthonormal set. This means each column vector must have a norm of 1, and any two distinct column vectors must be orthogonal (their dot product is 0).\n\nLet the column vectors of `Q` be $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$:\n$q_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix}$, $q_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}$, $q_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n1.  **Check existing column vectors:**\n    *   Norm of $q_1$: $||q_1||^2 = (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Norm of $q_2$: $||q_2||^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + 0^2 + (-1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Orthogonality of $q_1$ and $q_2$: $q_1 \\cdot q_2 = (1/\\sqrt{3})(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (1/\\sqrt{3})(0) + (1/\\sqrt{3})(-1/\\sqrt{2}) = 1/\\sqrt{6} - 1/\\sqrt{6} = 0$. (Satisfied)\n\n2.  **Apply orthonormality conditions for $q_3$:**\n    *   **Unit norm for $q_3$**: $||q_3||^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ (Equation 1)\n    *   **Orthogonality of $q_1$ and $q_3$**: $q_1 \\cdot q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{3})a + (1/\\sqrt{3})b + (1/\\sqrt{3})c = 0$. Multiplying by $\\sqrt{3}$ gives $a + b + c = 0$ (Equation 2)\n    *   **Orthogonality of $q_2$ and $q_3$**: $q_2 \\cdot q_3 = (1/\\sqrt{2})a + (0)b + (-1/\\sqrt{2})c = 0$. Multiplying by $\\sqrt{2}$ gives $a - c = 0 \\implies a = c$ (Equation 3)\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    *   From Equation 3, substitute $c=a$ into Equation 2: $a + b + a = 0 \\implies 2a + b = 0 \\implies b = -2a$.\n    *   Substitute $c=a$ and $b=-2a$ into Equation 1: $a^2 + (-2a)^2 + a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = 1 \\implies 6a^2 = 1 \\implies a^2 = 1/6$.\n    *   Therefore, $a = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n4.  **Determine $(a, b, c)$ values:**\n    *   **Case 1:** If $a = 1/\\sqrt{6}$:\n        $c = a = 1/\\sqrt{6}$\n        $b = -2a = -2/\\sqrt{6}$\n        So, $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6})$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n    *   **Case 2:** If $a = -1/\\sqrt{6}$:\n        $c = a = -1/\\sqrt{6}$\n        $b = -2a = -2(-1/\\sqrt{6}) = 2/\\sqrt{6}$\n        So, $(a, b, c) = (-1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$. This is not directly listed as an option.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Discrepancy with Answer Key:**\n    Based on the mathematical derivation, the values $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, -2/\\sqrt{6}, 1/\\sqrt{6})$ (Option B) correctly render the matrix `Q` orthonormal.\n    Let's check the provided answer key, Option D: $(1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$.\n    If $(a, b, c) = (1/\\sqrt{6}, 2/\\sqrt{6}, -1/\\sqrt{6})$:\n    *   $a+b+c = 1/\\sqrt{6} + 2/\\sqrt{6} - 1/\\sqrt{6} = 2/\\sqrt{6} \\neq 0$. This violates Equation 2 ($a+b+c=0$).\n    *   $a-c = 1/\\sqrt{6} - (-1/\\sqrt{6}) = 2/\\sqrt{6} \\neq 0$. This violates Equation 3 ($a=c$).\n    Therefore, Option D does not satisfy the conditions for an orthonormal matrix. There appears to be a discrepancy between the derived correct answer (Option B) and the provided answer key (Option D). Following the instructions, the answer key 'D' is marked as correct, but the detailed derivation shows 'B' is the mathematically sound solution."

        "Step 1: Recall the definition of an orthonormal matrix. A real square matrix is orthonormal (or orthogonal) if its column vectors (or row vectors) form an orthonormal set. This means each column vector must have a unit norm (magnitude of 1), and any two distinct column vectors must be orthogonal (their dot product is 0).",
        "Step 2: Identify the column vectors of the given matrix Q. Let Col1 = [1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3]^T, Col2 = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T, and Col3 = [a, b, c]^T.",
        "Step 3: Verify that the first two columns are already orthonormal. Calculate their norms: ||Col1||^2 = (1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2 + (1/√3)^2 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1. ||Col2||^2 = (1/√2)^2 + 0^2 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1. Calculate their dot product: Col1 · Col2 = (1/√3)(1/√2) + (1/√3)(0) + (1/√3)(-1/√2) = 1/√6 + 0 - 1/√6 = 0. Thus, Col1 and Col2 are orthonormal.",

        "Step 5: Substitute a = c into a + b + c = 0 to get a + b + a = 0, which means 2a + b = 0, or b = -2a.",

        "Step 7: Substitute b = -2a and c = a into the norm equation: a^2 + (-2a)^2 + a^2 = 1.",
        "Step 8: Simplify and solve for a: a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = 1 => 6a^2 = 1 => a^2 = 1/6 => a = ±1/√6.",
