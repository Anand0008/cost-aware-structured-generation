      "reasoning": "The total thrust (F) from a jet engine nozzle is given by the equation: F = \\dot{m} (V_e - V_a) + (P_e - P_a) A_e, where \\dot{m} is the mass flow rate, V_e is the exit velocity, V_a is the flight velocity, P_e is the exit static pressure, P_a is the ambient static pressure, and A_e is the exit area. The first term is momentum thrust, and the second is pressure thrust.\n\nFor a choked nozzle, the mass flow rate (\\dot{m}) is constant for given stagnation conditions and throat area. The flight velocity (V_a) is also constant.\n\nThe problem states the nozzle is 'always under-expanded'. This means that for all given exit Mach numbers (M_e = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5), the exit static pressure (P_e) is greater than the ambient static pressure (P_a) (i.e., P_e > P_a). Consequently, the pressure thrust term (P_e - P_a) A_e is always positive and contributes to the total thrust.\n\nIn an under-expanded nozzle, the flow has not expanded enough to reach the optimal condition where P_e = P_a (which would maximize thrust for a given mass flow rate). To increase thrust, the flow needs to be expanded further. Increasing the exit Mach number (M_e) (which implies increasing the nozzle's expansion ratio, A_e/A*) leads to:\n1. An increase in exit velocity (V_e), thus increasing the momentum thrust component \\dot{m} (V_e - V_a).\n2. A decrease in exit static pressure (P_e), bringing it closer to P_a.\n3. An increase in exit area (A_e).\n\nAs long as the nozzle remains under-expanded (P_e > P_a), further expansion (i.e., increasing M_e) will increase the total thrust, moving it closer to the maximum possible thrust at P_e = P_a. Therefore, among the given options, the highest exit Mach number (2.5) represents the greatest expansion and will yield the highest thrust. This is consistent with the general principle that for fixed flight speed, higher jet speed yields higher thrust, even if propulsive efficiency might decrease."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify Given Information and Assumptions: The aircraft is flying at Mach 1.5, stagnation temperature at the nozzle entry is 800 K. The nozzle is choked and always under-expanded (meaning exit pressure P_e is always greater than ambient pressure P_a). Exhaust gas properties are given (\\gamma = 1.4, R \\approx 286.69 J/kg-K).",
        "Recall the Thrust Equation for a Nozzle: The total thrust F is composed of momentum thrust and pressure thrust: F = \\dot{m} (V_e - V_a) + (P_e - P_a) A_e. Here, \\dot{m} is the mass flow rate, V_e is the exit velocity, V_a is the ambient (or flight) velocity, P_e is the exit static pressure, P_a is the ambient static pressure, and A_e is the exit area.",
        "Interpret Nozzle Conditions: \"Choked\" implies that the mass flow rate \\dot{m} is constant for fixed stagnation conditions and throat area. \"Always under-expanded\" means that for all given exit Mach numbers, P_e > P_a. This ensures the pressure thrust term (P_e - P_a) A_e is always positive and contributes to the total thrust.",
        "Analyze the Effect of Exit Mach Number (M_e) on Thrust Components: Momentum Thrust: For a given stagnation state, increasing the exit Mach number M_e leads to a higher exit velocity V_e (since V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} and T_e decreases with M_e but M_e increases more significantly). Thus, the momentum thrust term \\dot{m} (V_e - V_a) increases with M_e. Pressure Thrust: As M_e increases, the flow expands more, causing the exit static pressure P_e to decrease. This reduces the pressure thrust term (P_e - P_a) A_e.",
        "Determine the Overall Trend for Under-expanded Nozzles: In an under-expanded nozzle, the flow has not expanded enough. Increasing M_e (by increasing the nozzle's expansion ratio) moves the nozzle closer to the perfectly expanded condition (P_e = P_a), where the pressure thrust term would be zero and the exhaust velocity is maximized for the given expansion. Since the nozzle is *always* under-expanded for the given options, the positive contribution from the increasing momentum thrust outweighs the decreasing (but still positive) pressure thrust.",
        "Conclusion: For the given conditions, the total thrust increases with the exit Mach number. Therefore, the highest thrust corresponds to the largest exit Mach number provided in the options.",
        "Select the Answer: Among the given options (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5), the highest exit Mach number is 2.5. This will yield the maximum thrust."
