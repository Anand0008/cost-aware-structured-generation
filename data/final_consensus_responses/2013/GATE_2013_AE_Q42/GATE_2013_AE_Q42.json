      "reasoning": "The problem describes a thin rectangular plate under pure bending moment `M`. From elementary beam theory, the normal stress `$\\sigma_x$` for a beam of thickness `t` and depth `b` under pure bending is given by `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{I}$`, where `I` is the moment of inertia. For a rectangular cross-section, `I = \\frac{tb^3}{12}$`. Thus, `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{(tb^3/12)} = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. In pure bending, `$\\sigma_y = 0$` and `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`. An Airy's stress function `$\\phi$` must satisfy these stress conditions when differentiated:\n`$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`\n`$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`\n`$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`\n\nLet's test Option B: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} y^3$`\n1. `$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} (3y^2) = \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2$`\n2. `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{6M}{tb^3} (2y) = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. This matches the expected normal stress.\n3. `$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = 0$`\n4. `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = 0$`. This matches the expected normal stress in y-direction.\n5. `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2 \\right) = 0$`. This matches the expected shear stress.\n\nFinally, a valid Airy's stress function must also satisfy the biharmonic compatibility equation `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`. For `$\\phi = \\frac{2M}{tb^3} y^3$`:\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4} = 0$`\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial y^4} = \\frac{\\partial^3}{\\partial y^3} \\left( \\frac{6M}{tb^3} y^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{12My}{tb^3} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{12M}{tb^3} \\right) = 0$`\n`$\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} = 0$`\nSince all fourth derivatives are zero, `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`. Thus, Option B is a valid Airy's stress function."

        "Understand the problem: A thin rectangular plate of dimensions `L \\times b \\times t` is subjected to a pure bending moment `M`. The goal is to identify a valid Airy stress function `$\\phi$` that represents this pure bending stress state.",
        "Recall the expected stress distribution for pure bending from elementary beam theory: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{I}$`, `$\\sigma_y = 0$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`. Also, recall the relations between stresses and Airy stress function `$\\phi$`: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$`, `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$`, and `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$`.",
        "Calculate the moment of inertia `I` for the rectangular cross-section: `I = \\frac{tb^3}{12}$`. Substitute this into the flexure formula to get the explicit target stress: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. For pure bending, `$\\sigma_y = 0$` and `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`.",
        "Evaluate each given option. For a valid Airy stress function `$\\phi$` representing pure bending, it must satisfy two conditions: 1) The derived stresses `$\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy}$` must match the expected stress state (`$\\sigma_x = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$, $\\sigma_y = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = 0$`). 2) The function `$\\phi$` must satisfy the biharmonic compatibility equation `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`.",
        "Test Option A: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M x^3}{t b^3}$`. Calculate stresses: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$`, `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{12M x}{t b^3}$`, `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$`. This does not match the pure bending stress state (`$\\sigma_x$` should be non-zero and linear in `y`, `$\\sigma_y$` should be zero). Also, check compatibility: `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4} = \\frac{48M}{t b^3} \\neq 0$`. Thus, Option A is incorrect.",
        "Test Option B: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M y^3}{t b^3}$`. Calculate stresses: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{2M}{tb^3} y^3 \\right) = \\frac{12My}{tb^3}$`. `$\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = 0$`. `$\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$`. These derived stresses match the expected pure bending stress state (`$\\sigma_x = \\frac{My}{I}$`, `$\\sigma_y = 0$`, `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`).",
        "Verify compatibility for Option B: `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial y^4}$`. Since `$\\phi = \\frac{2M y^3}{t b^3}$` is a cubic polynomial in `y` and independent of `x`, all fourth partial derivatives are zero. Thus, `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$`. Option B satisfies both stress matching and compatibility conditions, making it the correct Airy stress function.",
        "Test Option C: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M (x^3+y^3)}{t b^3}$`. This function is a sum of the functions from Option A and Option B. As Option A was found to be incompatible (`$\\nabla^4 \\phi \\neq 0$`), Option C will also be incompatible (`$\\nabla^4 \\phi = \\nabla^4 (\\text{Option A}) + \\nabla^4 (\\text{Option B}) = \\frac{48M}{t b^3} + 0 \\neq 0$`). Thus, Option C is incorrect.",
        "Test Option D: `$\\phi = \\frac{2M y^4}{t b^3}$`. Calculate stresses: `$\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{24M y^2}{t b^3}$`. This stress is quadratic in `y`, not linear, and therefore does not match the expected pure bending stress state. Also, check compatibility: `$\\nabla^4 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial y^4} = \\frac{48M}{t b^3} \\neq 0$`. Thus, Option D is incorrect.",
        "Based on the evaluation, only Option B (`$\\phi = \\frac{2M y^3}{t b^3}$`) correctly reproduces the pure bending stress state and satisfies the biharmonic compatibility equation. Therefore, Option B is the correct Airy stress function.",
