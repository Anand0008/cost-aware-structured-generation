      "reasoning": "To determine the bending moment at the mid-point of section AB, we first need to calculate the support reactions at A and B. The beam has a total length of $L + L/2 = 3L/2$ and is subjected to a uniformly distributed load (UDL) of intensity $q$ over its entire length.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Support Reactions ($R_A$, $R_B$)**\nLet's take moments about support A (hinge) to find the reaction at B ($R_B$). We assume upward forces and anti-clockwise moments as positive.\nTotal downward load due to UDL = $q \\times (L + L/2) = q \\times (3L/2)$.\nThe centroid of this total load is at $(3L/2) / 2 = 3L/4$ from A.\n\n$\\sum M_A = 0$\n$R_B \\times L - (q \\times 3L/2) \\times (3L/4) = 0$\n$R_B \\times L = \\frac{9qL^2}{8}$\n$R_B = \\frac{9qL}{8}$ (upward)\n\nNow, apply the vertical force equilibrium equation:\n$\\sum F_y = 0$\n$R_A + R_B - (q \\times 3L/2) = 0$\n$R_A + \\frac{9qL}{8} - \\frac{3qL}{2} = 0$\n$R_A = \\frac{3qL}{2} - \\frac{9qL}{8} = \\frac{12qL - 9qL}{8} = \\frac{3qL}{8}$ (upward)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Bending Moment at the mid-point of AB**\nThe mid-point of section AB is at a distance $x = L/2$ from support A.\nConsider the section of the beam from A to $x = L/2$. The forces acting on this section are the reaction $R_A$ and the UDL $q$ over the length $x$.\n\nThe bending moment $M(x)$ at any point $x$ from A is given by:\n$M(x) = R_A \\times x - (q \\times x) \\times (x/2)$\n\nSubstitute $x = L/2$ and $R_A = 3qL/8$:\n$M(L/2) = \\left(\\frac{3qL}{8}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(q \\times \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{4}\\right)$\n$M(L/2) = \\frac{3qL^2}{16} - \\frac{qL^2}{8}$\n$M(L/2) = \\frac{3qL^2}{16} - \\frac{2qL^2}{16}$\n$M(L/2) = \\frac{qL^2}{16}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the nature of the bending moment (sagging/hogging)**\nA positive bending moment, according to standard sign conventions, indicates sagging (compression in the top fibers and tension in the bottom fibers, causing a concave upward curvature). Since the calculated value $M(L/2) = \\frac{qL^2}{16}$ is positive, the bending moment is sagging.\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at the mid-point of AB is $\\frac{qL^2}{16}$ sagging, which corresponds to option A."

        "Apply moment equilibrium about support A ($\\sum M_A = 0$) to find the reaction at B ($R_B$): $R_B \\times L - (q \\times 3L/2) \\times (3L/4) = 0$. This yields $R_B = \\frac{9qL}{8}$.",
        "Apply vertical force equilibrium ($\\sum F_y = 0$) to find the reaction at A ($R_A$): $R_A + R_B - q \\times (3L/2) = 0$. Substituting $R_B$, we get $R_A = \\frac{3qL}{8}$.",
        "Identify the point where the bending moment is required: the mid-point of section AB, which is at a distance $x = L/2$ from support A. Consider the left segment of the beam from A to this point.",

Substitute $R_A = \\frac{3qL}{8}$ and $x = \\frac{L}{2}$: $M(L/2) = \\left(\\frac{3qL}{8}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(q \\times \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3qL^2}{16} - \\frac{qL^2}{8} = \\frac{qL^2}{16}$. The calculated bending moment is positive, indicating sagging.",
