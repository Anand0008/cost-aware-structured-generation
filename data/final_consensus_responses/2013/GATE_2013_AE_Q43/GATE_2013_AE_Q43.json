      "reasoning": "The problem models a cantilever beam of negligible mass with a tip mass as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system. The natural angular frequency (ω_n) for such a system is given by ω_n = sqrt(k/m), where k is the equivalent stiffness of the beam and m is the tip mass. For a cantilever beam with a point load at the free end, the equivalent stiffness k is given by k = (3EI)/L^3, where E is Young's modulus, I is the area moment of inertia, and L is the beam length. Combining these, we get ω_n = sqrt((3EI)/(mL^3)). The area moment of inertia I for a rectangular cross-section is I = (bh^3)/12, where b is the width and h is the thickness.\n\nFirst, calculate I:\nb = 8 mm = 0.008 m\nh = 6 mm = 0.006 m\nI = (0.008 * (0.006)^3) / 12 = 1.44 * 10^-10 m^4.\n\nNext, rearrange the natural frequency formula to solve for E:\nω_n^2 = (3EI)/(mL^3)\nE = (ω_n^2 * m * L^3) / (3I)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\nω_n = 10 rad/s\nm = 1.4 kg\nL = 0.6 m\nE = (10^2 * 1.4 * (0.6)^3) / (3 * 1.44 * 10^-10)\nE = (100 * 1.4 * 0.216) / (4.32 * 10^-10)\nE = 30.24 / (4.32 * 10^-10)\nE = 7 * 10^10 Pa\n\nFinally, convert E to GPa:\nE = 7 * 10^10 Pa = 70 * 10^9 Pa = 70 GPa.\nThis result matches the expected answer."

      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure about I, recall that for a rectangle, I is proportional to the cube of the dimension in bending. Since thickness (6 mm) is smaller than width (8 mm), the fundamental vibration likely uses the smaller dimension cubed, so I ~ (0.006)^3. Also, recall that typical metallic Young's modulus (E) is 70–210 GPa; any answer far outside this range is likely wrong.",

It involves assuming a deflection shape for the beam (e.g., static deflection curve), computing maximum potential (strain) and kinetic energies, and then equating them to find the natural frequency. This method can account for the distributed mass of the beam if it's not negligible, providing a more accurate estimate than a simple SDOF approximation.",
