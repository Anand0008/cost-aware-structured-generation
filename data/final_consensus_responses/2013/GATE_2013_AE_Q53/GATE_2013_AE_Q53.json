      "reasoning": "Based on thin airfoil theory and superposition, modeling each airfoil by a vortex at its quarter-chord (aerodynamic center), and applying the boundary condition that the total normal velocity (freestream + induced) is zero at the three-quarter chord point of each airfoil (as implied by the linked Q52 context), we can derive two linear equations. Solving these equations yields \\(\\Gamma_1 = (4/3)\\pi cU\\alpha\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2 = (2/3)\\pi cU\\alpha\\), which corresponds to option A. The official answer key states 'Marks to All', which may indicate ambiguity or errors in the original exam, but a theoretical derivation points to A as the physically consistent answer."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation and Application of Thin Airfoil Theory",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the problem setup and key parameters. Two identical thin symmetric airfoils are placed in tandem along the same chord line. The first airfoil has circulation Γ₁ at its quarter-chord. The second airfoil, placed a distance c/2 behind the trailing edge of the first, has circulation Γ₂ at its quarter-chord. The chord length is c, freestream velocity U, angle of attack α.",
        "Step 2: Establish a coordinate system and identify the positions of the vortices and collocation points. Place the leading edge of the first airfoil at x=0. Its quarter-chord (vortex location) is at x₁ = c/4. Its trailing edge is at x=c. The second airfoil's leading edge is at x = c + c/2 = 3c/2. Its quarter-chord (vortex location) is at x₂ = 3c/2 + c/4 = 7c/4.",
        "Step 3: Recall the boundary condition for thin airfoil theory. For a thin symmetric airfoil, the normal velocity is zero at the three-quarter chord point to satisfy the Kutta condition. Thus, for airfoil 1, the collocation point is at x₌₁ = 3c/4. For airfoil 2, it is at x₌₂ = (3c/2) + (3c/4) = 9c/4.",
        "Step 4: Apply the boundary condition at each collocation point. The total normal velocity (upward positive) must be zero. This total velocity is the sum of the freestream normal component (Uα) and the induced velocities from both vortices. The induced upward velocity w at point x due to a vortex of strength Γ at x_v is w = Γ / (2π (x_v - x)).",
        "Step 5: Formulate the equation for airfoil 1 at its collocation point x₌₁ = 3c/4. Uα + Γ₁ / (2π (x₁ - x₌₁)) + Γ₂ / (2π (x₂ - x₌₁)) = 0. Calculate distances: x₁ - x₌₁ = c/4 - 3c/4 = -c/2. x₂ - x₌₁ = 7c/4 - 3c/4 = c. Substitute: Uα - Γ₁ / (πc) + Γ₂ / (2πc) = 0. (Equation 1)",
        "Step 6: Formulate the equation for airfoil 2 at its collocation point x₌₂ = 9c/4. Uα + Γ₁ / (2π (x₁ - x₌₂)) + Γ₂ / (2π (x₂ - x₌₂)) = 0. Calculate distances: x₁ - x₌₂ = c/4 - 9c/4 = -2c. x₂ - x₌₂ = 7c/4 - 9c/4 = -c/2. Substitute: Uα - Γ₁ / (4πc) - Γ₂ / (πc) = 0. (Equation 2)",
        "Step 7: Solve the system of two linear equations for Γ₁ and Γ₂. From Eq1: Uα = (2Γ₁ - Γ₂) / (2πc). From Eq2: Uα = (Γ₁ + 4Γ₂) / (4πc). Equate the expressions for Uα: (2Γ₁ - Γ₂) / 2 = (Γ₁ + 4Γ₂) / 4 ⇒ 4Γ₁ - 2Γ₂ = Γ₁ + 4Γ₂ ⇒ 3Γ₁ = 6Γ₂ ⇒ Γ₁ = 2Γ₂. Substitute Γ₁ = 2Γ₂ into the expression for Uα from Eq1: Uα = (2(2Γ₂) - Γ₂) / (2πc) = (4Γ₂ - Γ₂) / (2πc) = 3Γ₂ / (2πc). Solve for Γ₂: Γ₂ = (2πc Uα) / 3. Then, Γ₁ = 2Γ₂ = (4πc Uα) / 3.",
        "Step 8: Note on the question's context. The standard circulation for an isolated thin symmetric airfoil is Γ = πc Uα. The derived Γ₁ = (4/3)πc Uα and Γ₂ = (2/3)πc Uα show the effect of mutual interference. It's important to note that some interpretations of this question, or the options provided, might lead to discrepancies with standard isolated airfoil theory, which led to the GATE exam awarding full marks to all options due to ambiguity."
