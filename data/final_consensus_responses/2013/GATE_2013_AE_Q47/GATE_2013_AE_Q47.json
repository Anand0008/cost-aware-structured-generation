        "Step 1: Identify given data and the core principle. The problem involves two rockets, P (two-stage) and Q (single-stage), with identical specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) and a payload of 2 kg.

We need to find the ratio of their total change in velocity ($\\Delta V$), neglecting drag and gravity. The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation is the fundamental formula: $\\Delta V = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln \\left( \\frac{M_i}{M_f} \\right)$. Let $C = g_0 I_{sp}$ for simplicity, as it will cancel out in the ratio.",
