      "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{crit}$) is defined as the lowest freestream Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$) at which the local Mach number ($M_{local}$) at any point on an airfoil's surface first reaches unity ($M_{local} = 1$). For a flat plate of zero thickness at zero angle of attack, there are no geometric features (thickness, camber, or angle of attack) to induce any acceleration or deceleration of the flow. Consequently, the flow remains undisturbed, meaning the local Mach number everywhere on the surface is identical to the freestream Mach number ($M_{local} = M_{\\infty}$). Therefore, the condition $M_{local} = 1$ will only be met when the freestream Mach number itself is 1. Hence, the critical Mach number for this specific configuration is 1."
