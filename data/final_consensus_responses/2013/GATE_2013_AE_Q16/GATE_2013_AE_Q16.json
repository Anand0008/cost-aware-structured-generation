      "reasoning": "For a long thin-walled open section (like the L-section shown in the figure) subjected to pure twist, the cross-section undergoes both in-plane rotation and out-of-plane warping. In-plane rotation occurs about the shear center, causing tangential displacements (horizontal and vertical) for points not located at the shear center. Out-of-plane warping involves axial displacement of points on the cross-section. Point A, being a corner point, would generally experience all three types of movement: horizontal, vertical, and axial. The problem is ambiguous because it does not specify the exact location of point A relative to the shear center, the axis of twist, or whether warping is restrained. Without these essential conditions, the exact displacement components of point A cannot be uniquely determined, and different reasonable assumptions can lead to different conclusions. Therefore, none of the provided options fully or unambiguously describe the motion, justifying the 'Marks to All' designation by GATE."

        "Step 1: Identify the type of cross-section. The figure shows an L-shaped cross-section, which is a thin-walled *open* section, subjected to pure twist (torsion).",
        "Step 2: Recall the fundamental behavior of non-circular and open sections under torsion. Unlike circular shafts where plane sections remain plane, non-circular sections (especially open ones) experience *warping* in addition to rotation when subjected to pure twist. This warping is an out-of-plane (axial) displacement.",
        "Step 3: Warping is the out-of-plane (axial) displacement of points on the cross-section, meaning the cross-section distorts axially. Therefore, point A will generally experience axial movement. Additionally, the cross-section rotates about its shear center. If point A is not located at the shear center, it will also experience in-plane (horizontal and/or vertical) displacement due to this rotation.",
        "Step 4: For an L-section, the shear center is typically located at the intersection of the centerlines of the two legs, which is outside the material of the section. Since point A is a corner point on the cross-section and not the shear center, it will undergo tangential displacement due to this rotation, resulting in both horizontal and vertical components of motion within the plane of the cross-section.",
        "Step 5: Based on the analysis, point A will experience axial (warping) movement and, due to rotation about the shear center (which is external to point A), it will also experience both horizontal and vertical in-plane movements. Therefore, point A will move horizontally, vertically, and axially.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize the movements and evaluate the options. Based on the analysis, point A will move horizontally, vertically, and axially. None of the given options correctly describe this combined motion. Options A, B, and D incorrectly state that there is no axial movement or no vertical/horizontal movement. Option C incorrectly states no movement in any direction. This explains why the answer key is 'Marks to All'."
