      "reasoning": "The question asks to compare Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) based on two criteria: \\$\\Delta V\\$ requirement for launch and altitude. \n\n1.  **Altitude Comparison:**\n    *   Low Earth Orbit (LEO) typically ranges from approximately 200 km to 2000 km above Earth's surface.\n    *   Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) has an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above Earth's surface.\n    *   Therefore, the altitude of LEO is significantly lower than that of GSO.\n\n2.  **\\$\\Delta V\\$ Requirement Comparison:**\n    *   \\$\\Delta V\\$ (change in velocity) represents the total propulsive effort required for a mission. To reach a higher orbit, more energy must be imparted to the spacecraft to increase its potential and kinetic energy.\n    *   Launching a satellite to a higher orbit like GSO (35,786 km altitude) requires substantially more energy and thus a greater total \\$\\Delta V\\$ than launching it to a much lower orbit like LEO (200-2000 km altitude). This is a fundamental principle of orbital mechanics; higher orbits are 'harder' to reach.\n    *   Therefore, the \\$\\Delta V\\$ requirement for launch to LEO is lower than that for GSO.\n\nCombining these two points, option B states that '\\$\\Delta V\\$ requirement for launch to LEO is lower than that for GSO, and altitude of LEO is lower than that for GSO', which is consistent with the principles of orbital mechanics."
