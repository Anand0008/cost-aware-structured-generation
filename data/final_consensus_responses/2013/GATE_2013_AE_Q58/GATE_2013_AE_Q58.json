Option C, 'he displayed modesty in his interactions,' directly aligns with this definition and best captures this aspect of Gandhi's personality. Gandhi was known for his humble and modest demeanor, not seeking personal glory, which exemplifies humility. Options A, B, and D describe other positive attributes like his political impact, humanitarian work, or general character, but do not specifically define or exemplify his humility as directly as option C does."

        "Evaluate each option against the definition of humility. Option A ('he played an important role in humiliating exit of British from India') describes a political outcome, not a personal trait of humility.",
        "Analyze Option B ('he worked for humanitarian causes'). While true and aligned with his values, this describes his actions and compassion, not specifically his modesty or humility.",
        "Examine Option C ('he displayed modesty in his interactions'). Modesty is a direct synonym and a key characteristic of humility, making this option a direct match for the question.",
        "Consider Option D ('he was a fine human being'). This is a general positive statement about his character but does not specifically define or illustrate his humility.",
        "Conclude that Option C is the most accurate and direct answer, as it directly describes Gandhi's humility through his modesty in interactions."
