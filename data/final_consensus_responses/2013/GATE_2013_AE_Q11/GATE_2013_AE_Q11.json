      "reasoning": "The question asks for the statement that is NOT TRUE for a supersonic flow. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A. Over a gradual expansion, entropy remains constant:** This statement is TRUE. Supersonic expansion, whether gradual or over a sharp convex corner (Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan), is an isentropic process. This means entropy remains constant (ds=0).\n\n*   **B. Over a sharp expansion corner, entropy can increase:** This statement is FALSE. All supersonic expansions, including those over sharp corners (Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans), are isentropic. Entropy *remains constant* and does not increase. The formation of a shock wave (which would increase entropy) is physically impossible at an expansion corner, as it would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics by requiring a decrease in entropy for the flow to turn outward as a shock.\n\n*   **C. Over a gradual compression, entropy can remain constant:** This statement is TRUE. Supersonic flow undergoing gradual compression (e.g., Prandtl-Meyer compression over a smooth concave corner) is an isentropic process, meaning entropy remains constant (ds=0).\n\n*   **D. Over a sharp compression corner, entropy increases:** This statement is TRUE. A sharp compression corner in supersonic flow generates an oblique shock wave. Shock waves are inherently non-isentropic processes, which means entropy *increases* across them (ds>0).\n\nSince the question asks for the statement that is NOT TRUE, option B is the correct answer."
