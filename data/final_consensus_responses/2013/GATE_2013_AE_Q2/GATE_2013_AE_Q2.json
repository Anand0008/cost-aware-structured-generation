      "reasoning": "The integral $\\int_{4}^{5} \\frac{x+2}{x^{2}+4x-21}\\,dx$ can be efficiently solved using a u-substitution. Let $u = x^2 + 4x - 21$. Then, the differential $du = (2x + 4) dx = 2(x + 2) dx$. This implies $(x + 2) dx = \\frac{1}{2} du$. The limits of integration must also be changed: for $x=4$, $u_{lower} = 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11$; for $x=5$, $u_{upper} = 5^2 + 4(5) - 21 = 25 + 20 - 21 = 24$. The integral transforms to $\\int_{11}^{24} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{11}^{24} \\frac{1}{u} du$. Evaluating this, we get $\\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_{11}^{24} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(24) - \\ln(11))$. Using the logarithm property $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(\\frac{a}{b})$, this becomes $\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(\\frac{24}{11})$. Finally, using the property $k \\ln a = \\ln(a^k)$, the expression simplifies to $\\ln((\\frac{24}{11})^{1/2}) = \\ln(\\sqrt{\\frac{24}{11}})$. This matches option A."

        "Observe the relationship between the numerator and the derivative of the denominator. The derivative of the denominator $x^2 + 4x - 21$ is $2x + 4 = 2(x + 2)$, which is twice the numerator $x+2$.",
        "Perform a u-substitution. Let $u = x^2 + 4x - 21$. Then, the differential $du = (2x + 4) dx = 2(x + 2) dx$. This implies $(x + 2) dx = \\frac{1}{2} du$.",
        "Change the limits of integration. For the lower limit $x = 4$, $u_{lower} = 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 11$. For the upper limit $x = 5$, $u_{upper} = 5^2 + 4(5) - 21 = 24$.",

        "Apply the limits of integration: $\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln|24| - \\ln|11|) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln 24 - \\ln 11)$.",
