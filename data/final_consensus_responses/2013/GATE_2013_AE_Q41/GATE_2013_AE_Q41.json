A downward load P is applied at C. Assuming AB = 1m and BC = 1m (so AC = 2m), taking moments about A: $\\Sigma M_A = 0 \\implies F_{BD} \\times (1 \\text{ m}) - P \\times (2 \\text{ m}) = 0$. This gives the axial compressive force in column BD as $F_{BD} = 2P$.\n2.  **Column Buckling**: Column BD has a length L = 2 m, Young's modulus E = 200 GPa, and a circular cross-section with radius r = 10 mm. Since it is pinned at B and D, the effective length factor k = 1.0, so the effective length $L_e = kL = 2 \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Moment of inertia: $I = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.01 \\text{ m})^4}{4} = 7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$.\n    *   Euler's critical buckling load: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L_e^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(2 \\text{ m})^2} \\approx 3874.48 \\text{ N}$.\n3.  **Equating Forces**: For buckling to occur, the axial force in the column must equal the critical buckling load: $F_{BD} = P_{cr}$.\n    *   $2P = 3874.48 \\text{ N}$\n    *   $P = \\frac{3874.48}{2} \\approx 1937.24 \\text{ N}$.\nThis calculated value of approximately 1937.24 N falls within the specified correct answer range of 1900 to 2000 N."

        "Identify the column BD properties: length L = 2 m, circular cross-section with radius r = 10 mm, Young's modulus E = 200 GPa. The column is pinned at B and D, so the effective length factor k = 1.0, making the effective length L_e = L = 2 m. Also, identify the beam ABC geometry: hinged at A, supported by column BD at B, with load P at C. Assume AB = 1 m and BC = 1 m.",
        "Convert radius to meters: r = 10 mm = 0.01 m. Calculate the moment of inertia for the circular cross-section: $I = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.01)^4}{4} = 7.85398 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$.",
        "Convert Young's modulus to N/m^2: E = 200 GPa = $200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$. Use Euler's formula for the critical buckling load: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L_e^2}$.

        "Analyze the horizontal beam ABC using static equilibrium. Take moments about the hinge at A: $\\Sigma M_A = 0$. The force $F_{BD}$ acts upwards at B (1 m from A), and load P acts downwards at C (2 m from A). So, $F_{BD} \\times (1 \\text{ m}) - P \\times (2 \\text{ m}) = 0$. This yields $F_{BD} = 2P$.",
        "For buckling to occur, the axial compressive force in column BD must equal the critical buckling load: $F_{BD} = P_{cr}$. Therefore, $2P = 3874.48 \\text{ N}$. Solving for P: $P = \\frac{3874.48}{2} \\approx 1937.24 \\text{ N}$.",
        "Equate the internal compressive force in column BD ($F_{BD}$) to its critical buckling load ($P_{cr}$). From previous steps, $F_{BD} = 2P$. Therefore, $2P = P_{cr}$. Substitute the calculated $P_{cr}$ value (e.g., $3874.48 \\text{ N}$) and solve for $P$: $P = \\frac{3874.48}{2} \\approx 1937.24 \\text{ N}$.",
        "Verify that the slenderness ratio is high enough for Euler buckling to apply. For steel, with yield strength typically ~250 MPa, the limiting slenderness ratio is about 100.
