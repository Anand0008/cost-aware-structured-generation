      "reasoning": "The question asks for the ratio of the drag coefficient to the square of the lift coefficient ($C_d/C_l^2$) for a thin flat plate airfoil at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$ in a supersonic stream. We use the linearized supersonic thin airfoil theory formulas:\n\n1.  **Lift Coefficient ($C_l$)**: For a thin flat plate at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$ in supersonic flow, the lift coefficient is given by:\n    $$C_l = \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}$$\n\n2.  **Drag Coefficient ($C_d$)**: For a thin flat plate (zero thickness) at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$ in supersonic flow, the wave drag coefficient (which is the total drag for a zero-thickness flat plate) is given by:\n    $$C_d = \\frac{4\\alpha^2}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio $C_d/C_l^2$:\n\n$$ \\frac{C_d}{C_l^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\alpha^2}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}}{\\left(\\frac{4\\alpha}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}\\right)^2} $$\n\n$$ \\frac{C_d}{C_l^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\alpha^2}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}}{\\frac{16\\alpha^2}{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}} $$\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n\n$$ \\frac{C_d}{C_l^2} = \\frac{4\\alpha^2}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}} \\times \\frac{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}{16\\alpha^2} $$\n\nCancel out common terms ($4\\alpha^2$ and $M_{\\infty}^2 - 1$):\n\n$$ \\frac{C_d}{C_l^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}} \\times \\frac{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}{4} $$\n\nSince $M_{\\infty}^2 - 1 = (\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1})^2$, we can simplify further:\n\n$$ \\frac{C_d}{C_l^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}{4} $$\n\nThe final expression for $C_d/C_l^2$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{M_{\\infty}^2 - 1}}{4}$. This expression depends only on the freestream Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$) and is independent of the angle of attack ($\\alpha$). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
