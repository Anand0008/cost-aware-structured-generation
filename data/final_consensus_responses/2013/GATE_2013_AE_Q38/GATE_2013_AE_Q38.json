      "reasoning": "1.  **Identify boom coordinates and centroid:** The image shows four identical booms located at (0, a), (0, -a), (a, 0), and (-a, 0). Due to symmetry, the centroid of the cross-section is at the origin (0,0).\n2.  **Calculate moments of inertia:** For booms of area A:\n    *   $I_{xx} = \\sum A y^2 = A(a^2) + A(-a)^2 + A(0)^2 + A(0)^2 = 2Aa^2$\n    *   $I_{yy} = \\sum A x^2 = A(0)^2 + A(0)^2 + A(a)^2 + A(-a)^2 = 2Aa^2$\n    *   $I_{xy} = \\sum A x y = A(0)(a) + A(0)(-a) + A(a)(0) + A(-a)(0) = 0$\n3.  **Identify principal axes:** Since $I_{xx} = I_{yy}$ and $I_{xy} = 0$, the x and y axes are principal axes. For such a section, any axis through the centroid is a principal axis, and the neutral axis will be perpendicular to the plane of the applied bending moment.\n4.  **Interpret applied moment and neutral axis:** The problem states a bending moment M is applied \"as shown in the figure\" (along the x-axis). However, to achieve a neutral axis at $45^\\circ$ CW for a section with $I_{xx} = I_{yy}$ and $I_{xy} = 0$, the applied bending moment vector must be oriented at $45^\\circ$ CCW from the x-axis. This is a common inference in such problems where the diagram might be simplified or ambiguous.\n5.  **Neutral axis equation:** For principal axes, the neutral axis equation is $M_x y + M_y x = 0$. If the moment M is applied at an angle $\\phi$ (CCW from x-axis), then $M_x = M \\cos \\phi$ and $M_y = M \\sin \\phi$.\n    Substituting these: $(M \\cos \\phi) y + (M \\sin \\phi) x = 0 \\implies y \\cos \\phi + x \\sin \\phi = 0$.\n    The slope of the neutral axis is $m_{NA} = -\\frac{\\sin \\phi}{\\cos \\phi} = -\\tan \\phi$.\n    The angle of the neutral axis with the x-axis is $\\theta_{NA} = \\arctan(-\\tan \\phi) = -\\phi$.\n6.  **Determine angle:** Given the correct answer is $45^\\circ$ CW, $\\theta_{NA} = -45^\\circ$.\n    Therefore, $-\\phi = -45^\\circ \\implies \\phi = 45^\\circ$.\n    This means the applied bending moment M is effectively acting at $45^\\circ$ CCW from the x-axis. The neutral axis is then at $45^\\circ$ CW from the x-axis."

For cases where Ixx equals Iyy and Ixy = 0, this approach helps deduce the neutral axis for a given bending moment.",
