Absolute inlet flow angle equals relative outlet flow angle: $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$\n2.  Absolute outlet flow angle equals relative inlet flow angle: $\\alpha_2 = \\beta_1$\n\nFrom the given $\\alpha_1 = 45^\\circ$, we have $\\beta_2 = 45^\\circ$.\nAlso, from the velocity triangles for a 50% reaction stage, the blade speed ($u$) is related to the axial velocity ($c_a$) and the flow angles by:\n$u = c_a (\\tan \\alpha_1 + \\tan \\beta_1)$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$300 = 100 (\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan \\beta_1)$\n$3 = 1 + \\tan \\beta_1$ (since $\\tan 45^\\circ = 1$)\n$\\tan \\beta_1 = 2$\n\nSince $\\alpha_2 = \\beta_1$, we have $\\tan \\alpha_2 = \\tan \\beta_1 = 2$.\n\nThe work per unit mass ($W$) done on the fluid by the stage is given by Euler's turbomachinery equation for an axial compressor with constant axial velocity:\n$W = u c_a (\\tan \\alpha_2 - \\tan \\alpha_1)$\nSubstitute the calculated and given values:\n$W = 300 \\text{ m/s} \\times 100 \\text{ m/s} \\times (2 - 1)$\n$W = 30000 \\text{ J/kg}$\n\nConverting to kJ/kg:\n$W = 30 \\text{ kJ/kg}$\n\nThis result matches option A."
