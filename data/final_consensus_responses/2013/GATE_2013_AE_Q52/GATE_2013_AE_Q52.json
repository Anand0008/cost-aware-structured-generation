      "reasoning": "In the context of inviscid flow over a solid body, such as a thin airfoil, a fundamental kinematic boundary condition must be satisfied: the flow cannot penetrate the surface of the body. This means that the velocity component normal (perpendicular) to the airfoil's surface must be zero at every point on that surface. For a thin airfoil, especially in thin airfoil theory, the chord line is considered to represent the airfoil's surface for the purpose of applying these boundary conditions. Therefore, the normal velocity is zero at all points on the chord. The mention of circulation Γ₁ at the quarter chord (c/4) is relevant to the generation of lift and the modeling of the airfoil in thin airfoil theory, but it does not alter this fundamental kinematic boundary condition that applies to the entire surface. While option D is the most scientifically accurate and comprehensive response based on the principles of fluid mechanics, the official GATE answer key indicated 'Marks to All', suggesting potential ambiguity or a flaw in the question's phrasing, possibly due to mixing the concept of a single bound vortex at c/4 with the continuous vortex sheet model of thin airfoil theory."

        "Step 3: In thin airfoil theory, the airfoil's geometry is approximated by its chord line. Therefore, the chord line effectively represents the airfoil's surface for applying the no-penetration boundary condition.",
        "Step 4: Consequently, the normal velocity component must be zero at all points along the chord line of the thin airfoil.",
        "Step 5: The information about 'circulation at the quarter chord (c/4) is \\Gamma_1' is relevant for lift generation in thin airfoil theory but does not alter the fundamental kinematic boundary condition that the normal velocity must be zero on the entire surface (approximated by the chord line) of the airfoil.",
        "Step 6: Therefore, the normal velocity component is zero at all points along the chord line, including the quarter-chord, half-chord, and three-quarter-chord locations. The specific value of circulation at the quarter-chord is a related concept but does not change this fundamental boundary condition."
