Using the lift equation and the definition of wing loading, the trim lift coefficient is derived as $C_{L_{\\text{trim}}} = \\frac{2 (W/S)}{\\rho V^2}$. Substituting the given values: $W/S = 1000 \\ \\text{N/m}^2$, $\\rho = 1.22 \\ \\text{kg/m}^3$, $V = 90 \\ \\text{m/s}$, we compute $\\rho V^2 = 1.22 \\times (90)^2 = 9882 \\ \\text{kg/(m\\cdot s^2)}$ (or $\\text{N/m}^2$). Then $C_{L_{\\text{trim}}} = 2000 / 9882 \\approx 0.2024$, which rounds to 0.202, matching option D. The provided aerodynamic center and zero-lift pitching moment are not needed for this part; they are likely used in the linked question."
