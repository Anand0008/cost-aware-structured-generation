      "reasoning": "The problem involves a horizontal rectangular plate supported by hinges at three points (A, B, C) and subjected to a downward force P at point D. We need to find the upward reactions at A, B, and C. This is a 3D static equilibrium problem where all forces are perpendicular to the plate, and moments are taken about axes lying in the plane of the plate.\n\n1.  **Identify Support Reactions**: The problem asks for 'upward reactions' at A, B, and C. For a horizontal plate with vertical loads, 'hinged at points' typically implies that these supports provide only vertical reaction forces (preventing vertical translation) but allow rotation about any axis passing through the hinge point. Thus, we have three unknown upward reactions: $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$.\n\n2.  **Identify Equilibrium Equations**: For a rigid body in 3D static equilibrium under forces perpendicular to a plane (e.g., z-direction) and moments about axes in that plane (e.g., x and y axes), there are three independent equilibrium equations:\n    *   Sum of forces in the vertical direction: $\\sum F_z = 0$\n    *   Sum of moments about the x-axis: $\\sum M_x = 0$\n    *   Sum of moments about the y-axis: $\\sum M_y = 0$\n\n3.  **Check for Determinacy**: We have 3 unknown reactions ($R_A, R_B, R_C$) and 3 available equilibrium equations. Therefore, the system is statically determinate for vertical reactions, ruling out option A. The system is statically determinate for vertical reactions despite overall indeterminacy due to potential horizontal reaction components (which are not asked for).\n\n4.  **Set up Coordinate System and Forces**: Let the plate be a rectangle with vertices A, B, C, D. Let's assume a standard counter-clockwise labeling starting from the bottom-left corner. For convenience in moment calculations, let's place the origin at point A.\n    *   A = (0, 0)\n    *   B = ($L_x$, 0)\n    *   C = ($L_x$, $L_y$)\n    *   D = (0, $L_y$)\n    (Note: The problem states AC and BD are diagonals. If A=(0,0), B=(Lx,0), C=(Lx,Ly), D=(0,Ly), then AC is a diagonal and BD is a diagonal. This coordinate assignment is consistent.)\n\n    *   Applied force: $P$ (downward) at D (0, $L_y$)\n    *   Reactions: $R_A$ (upward) at A (0, 0), $R_B$ (upward) at B ($L_x$, 0), $R_C$ (upward) at C ($L_x$, $L_y$)\n\n5.  **Apply Equilibrium Equations**:\n    *   **$\\sum F_z = 0$ (Sum of vertical forces):**\n        $R_A + R_B + R_C - P = 0$\n        $R_A + R_B + R_C = P$ (Equation 1)\n\n    *   **$\\sum M_x = 0$ (Sum of moments about the x-axis, which is the line AB):**\n        Taking moments about the x-axis (line AB), the forces $R_A$ and $R_B$ have zero moment arm. The force $R_C$ is at $y = L_y$ and creates a moment $R_C \\cdot L_y$. The force $P$ is at $y = L_y$ and creates a moment $P \\cdot L_y$. Assuming counter-clockwise as positive (or consistent sign convention):\n        $R_C \\cdot L_y - P \\cdot L_y = 0$\n        $L_y (R_C - P) = 0$\n        Since $L_y \\neq 0$, we must have $R_C - P = 0 \\implies R_C = P$ (Equation 2)\n\n    *   **$\\sum M_y = 0$ (Sum of moments about the y-axis, which is the line AD):**\n        Taking moments about the y-axis (line AD), the forces $R_A$ and $P$ have zero moment arm. The force $R_B$ is at $x = L_x$ and creates a moment $R_B \\cdot L_x$. The force $R_C$ is at $x = L_x$ and creates a moment $R_C \\cdot L_x$. Both $R_B$ and $R_C$ create moments in the same direction about the y-axis (e.g., clockwise if looking from positive y-axis towards origin).\n        $R_B \\cdot L_x + R_C \\cdot L_x = 0$\n        $L_x (R_B + R_C) = 0$\n        Since $L_x \\neq 0$, we must have $R_B + R_C = 0$ (Equation 3)\n\n6.  **Solve the System of Equations**:\n    *   From Equation 2: $R_C = P$\n    *   Substitute $R_C = P$ into Equation 3: $R_B + P = 0 \\implies R_B = -P$\n    *   Substitute $R_C = P$ and $R_B = -P$ into Equation 1: $R_A + (-P) + P = P \\implies R_A = P$\n\nTherefore, the upward reactions are $R_A = P$, $R_B = -P$, and $R_C = P$. The negative sign for $R_B$ indicates that the reaction at B is actually a downward force, despite being initially assumed as upward. This matches option B."
