For steady, level flight at stall condition, the governing principle is that Lift (L) equals Weight (W).",
        "Step 2: Convert the aircraft weight to Newtons: $W = 30 \\text{ kN} = 30000 \\text{ N}$. Then, write the general lift equation: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$.",
        "Step 3: For steady, unaccelerated level flight at stall, the lift (L) equals the aircraft's weight (W), and the lift coefficient ($C_L$) reaches its maximum value ($C_{L,max}$). Substitute these conditions into the lift equation: $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{\\infty} V_{stall}^2 S C_{L,max}$.",
        "Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for the stall speed ($V_{stall}$): $V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho_{\\infty} S C_{L,max}}}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the numerical values into the derived formula: $W = 30000 \\text{ N}$, $\\rho_{\\infty} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $S = 30 \\text{ m}^2$, and $C_{L,max} = 1.4$.",
        "Step 6: Perform the calculation: $V_{stall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 30000}{1.22 \\times 30 \\times 1.4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{60000}{51.24}} \\approx \\sqrt{1170.96} \\approx 34.22 \\text{ m/s}$.",
