      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the exit static temperature ($T_e$) of a rocket nozzle under isentropic and optimally expanded conditions. Given the chamber pressure ($P_c = 100$ bar), chamber temperature ($T_c = 3000$ K), and ambient pressure ($P_a = 1$ bar). For optimal expansion, the exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure, i.e., $P_e = 1$ bar. The specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p = 1$ kJ/kg-K) is provided, but the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) is not. For isentropic flow, the temperature-pressure relation is $T_e/T_c = (P_e/P_c)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$. Since $\\gamma$ is not given, it must be inferred or derived. Assuming the working fluid behaves as an ideal gas and taking the specific gas constant ($R$) as approximately $0.287$ kJ/kg-K (a common value for air/combustion products in GATE context), we can find $\\gamma$. Using Mayer's relation, $c_p - c_v = R$, we get $c_v = c_p - R = 1 - 0.287 = 0.713$ kJ/kg-K. Then, $\\gamma = c_p / c_v = 1 / 0.713 \\approx 1.4025$. Alternatively, the exponent $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma$ can be directly calculated as $R/c_p = 0.287/1 = 0.287$. Substituting the values into the isentropic relation: $T_e = 3000 \\text{ K} \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\text{ bar}}{100 \\text{ bar}}\\right)^{0.287} = 3000 \\times (0.01)^{0.287} \\approx 3000 \\times 0.2683 \\approx 804.9 \\text{ K}$. This value is approximately 805 K."

        "- Ambient pressure, $P_a = 1$ bar",
        "- Specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p = 1$ kJ/kg-K = 1000 J/kg-K",
        "- The flow in the nozzle is isentropic and optimally expanded.",

        "For an optimally expanded nozzle, the exit static pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$).",
        "Therefore, $P_e = P_a = 1$ bar.",

        "For an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic process, the relationship between temperature and pressure is given by:",

        "Step 4: Address the Missing Ratio of Specific Heats ($\\gamma$).",
        "The problem provides $c_p$ but does not explicitly state the value of $\\gamma$. This is a common situation in competitive exams where a standard or implied value is expected. While $c_p$ and $R_g$ (specific gas constant) are related to $\\gamma$ ($c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R_g}{\\gamma-1}$ and $R_g = c_p - c_v$), $R_g$ is also not given. In the absence of explicit $\\gamma$ for combustion products, and considering the multiple-choice options, assuming $\\gamma = 1.4$ (a common value for diatomic gases like air, often used as a default in such problems) leads to one of the options. The given $c_p$ value is consistent with $\\gamma=1.4$ and a reasonable $R_g \\approx 285.7$ J/kg-K.",

Quickly identify the key given information (chamber pressure, temperature, ambient pressure) and apply the isentropic pressure-temperature relation.

The exponent (γ-1)/γ for common gases is between 0.166 (γ=1.2) and 0.286 (γ=1.4). Computing 0.01^0.166 ≈ 0.46 and 0.01^0.286 ≈ 0.27. Multiplying by 3000 K gives approximately 1380 K or 810 K. If 805 K is an option, it's a strong candidate.",
