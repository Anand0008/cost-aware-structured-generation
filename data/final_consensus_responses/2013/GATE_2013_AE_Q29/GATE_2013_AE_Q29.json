This yields the characteristic equation: $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Solve the Characteristic Equation**: Factor the quadratic equation: $(r - 1)^2 = 0$. This gives a repeated real root: $r = 1$.\n\n3.  **Write the General Solution**: For repeated real roots $r$, the general solution of a homogeneous linear ODE is of the form: $y(t) = (C_1 + C_2t)e^{rt}$. Substituting $r=1$, we get: $y(t) = (C_1 + C_2t)e^t$.\n\n4.  **Apply Initial Condition y(0) = 0**: Substitute $t=0$ and $y(0)=0$ into the general solution:\n    $0 = (C_1 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^0$\n    $0 = C_1 \\cdot 1$\n    $C_1 = 0$\n    The particular solution now becomes $y(t) = C_2te^t$.\n\n5.  **Find the First Derivative**: Differentiate $y(t) = C_2te^t$ with respect to $t$ using the product rule $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(C_2t \\cdot e^t) = C_2 \\cdot e^t + C_2t \\cdot e^t = C_2e^t(1 + t)$.\n\n6.  **Apply Initial Condition dy/dt(0) = 1**: Substitute $t=0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0)=1$ into the derivative:\n    $1 = C_2e^0(1 + 0)$\n    $1 = C_2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$\n    $C_2 = 1$\n\n7.  **Form the Particular Solution**: Substitute the values of $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = 1$ back into the general solution:\n    $y(t) = (0 + 1 \\cdot t)e^t = te^t$.\n\n8.  **Evaluate y(1)**: Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n    $y(1) = 1 \\cdot e^1 = e$.\n\nThis value matches option A."
