      "reasoning": "The sentence presents a list of items that engineering students should learn: 'mechanics', 'mathematics', and 'how to do computation'. For proper parallel structure, all items in a list should be in the same grammatical form. 'Mechanics' and 'mathematics' are both single nouns. However, 'how to do computation' is a noun phrase (specifically, an embedded question or a nominal clause acting as a noun) that breaks this parallelism. To maintain parallel structure, it should be a single noun like 'computation' or 'computations', or a gerund like 'computing'. Therefore, part IV ('how to do computation') is not appropriate because it violates parallel structure. The official answer key confirms D."

        "Examine the grammatical form of the third item, 'how to do computation'. This is an infinitive phrase/nominal clause, which is not parallel with the simple nouns 'mechanics' and 'mathematics'.",
        "The inconsistency lies in the grammatical forms: two simple nouns followed by a complex phrase. To maintain parallel structure, 'how to do computation' should be replaced with a noun like 'computation'.",
        "Therefore, the phrase 'how to do computation' (part IV) is grammatically inappropriate due to the lack of parallel structure."
