Applying this to `|-2X + 9| = 3` gives two cases:\n\n**Case 1:** `-2X + 9 = 3`\n`-2X = 3 - 9`\n`-2X = -6`\n`X = 3`\n\n**Case 2:** `-2X + 9 = -3`\n`-2X = -3 - 9`\n`-2X = -12`\n`X = 6`\n\nSo, the possible values for `X` are `3` and `6`.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate `|-X| - X²` for each value of `X`**\n\n**For X = 3:**\n`|-X| - X² = |-3| - (3)²`\n`= 3 - 9`\n`= -6`\n\n**For X = 6:**\n`|-X| - X² = |-6| - (6)²`\n`= 6 - 36`\n`= -30`\n\nThe possible values for `|-X| - X²` are `-6` and `-30`.
