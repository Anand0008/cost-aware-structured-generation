        "First, check for continuity at $x=0$. A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ if $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$. This requires the function to be defined at $a$, the limit to exist at $a$, and these two values to be equal.",
        "Evaluate $f(0)$: $f(0) = |0| = 0$. Evaluate $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x)$: Right-hand limit: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} |x| = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x = 0$. Left-hand limit: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} |x| = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} (-x) = 0$. Since the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} |x| = 0$.",
        "As $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = f(0) = 0$, the function $y = |x|$ is continuous at $x=0$.",
        "Next, check for differentiability at $x=0$. A function $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$ if the derivative $f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$ exists and is finite. This means the left-hand and right-hand derivatives must be equal.",
        "For $a=0$, the difference quotient is $\\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h} = \\frac{|h|}{h}$.",
        "Evaluate the one-sided limits of the difference quotient: Right-hand derivative: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|h|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1$.

Since the left-hand derivative ($-1$) and the right-hand derivative ($1$) are not equal, the limit $\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h|}{h}$ does not exist.",

Non-differentiable points in physical models can indicate idealizations (like perfectly rigid bodies or point loads) or physical discontinuities (like cracks or impacts)."
