First, 32 < 80 - 32t => 32t < 48 => t < 3/2. Second, 80 - 32t < 64 => -32t < -16 => 32t > 16 => t > 1/2. Combining: t must satisfy 1/2 < t < 3/2, which is the open interval (1/2, 3/2).

        "Solve the right part of the compound inequality: 80 - 32t < 64. Subtract 80 from both sides: -32t < -16. Divide by -32 and reverse the inequality sign: t > 16/32, which simplifies to t > 1/2.",
