      "reasoning": "As an aircraft transitions from subsonic to supersonic speeds, its aerodynamic center (AC) typically shifts rearward. This rearward shift of the AC relative to the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) increases the static margin. A larger static margin implies that for a given disturbance, a stronger restoring pitching moment is generated, making the aircraft more statically stable in pitch. Mathematically, this means the pitching moment derivative with respect to lift coefficient, dC_m/dC_L, becomes more negative (i.e., its absolute value increases). The RAG context explicitly states that for supersonic flight, the condition for dynamic stability becomes dC_m/dC_L < A_star, where A_star is a negative value. This is a stricter requirement than just dC_m/dC_L < 0 for subsonic flight, indicating that the aircraft must be designed to have a more negative dC_m/dC_L at supersonic speeds, which translates to increased static longitudinal stability. Therefore, the airplane experiences more stability in pitch at supersonic speeds than at subsonic speeds."

        "Step 2: Recall that the aerodynamic center (AC) is the point where the pitching moment coefficient is independent of the lift coefficient, and its position is affected by Mach number.",
        "Step 3: At supersonic speeds, a fundamental aerodynamic phenomenon is that the aerodynamic center (AC) typically shifts rearward (aft) compared to its position at subsonic speeds.",
        "Step 4: A rearward shift of the AC relative to the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) increases the static margin (the distance between the AC and CG).",
