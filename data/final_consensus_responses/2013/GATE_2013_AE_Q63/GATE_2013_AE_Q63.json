Finally, we check each option to see which pair of countries' tourist numbers sum up to exactly one-third of the total.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of tourists:**\n    USA: 2000\n    England: 3500\n    Germany: 1200\n    Italy: 1100\n    Japan: 2400\n    Australia: 2300\n    France: 1000\n    Total tourists $= 2000 + 3500 + 1200 + 1100 + 2400 + 2300 + 1000 = 13500$\n\n2.  **Calculate one-third of the total tourists:**\n    One-third of total tourists $= \\frac{1}{3} \\times 13500 = 4500$\n\n3.  **Check each option:**\n    A. USA and Japan: $2000 + 2400 = 4400$. This is not 4500.\n    B. USA and Australia: $2000 + 2300 = 4300$. This is not 4500.\n    C. England and France: $3500 + 1000 = 4500$. This matches one-third of the total tourists.\n    D. Japan and Australia: $2400 + 2300 = 4700$. This is not 4500.\n\nTherefore, the pair of countries that contributed to one-third of the total number of tourists is England and France."
