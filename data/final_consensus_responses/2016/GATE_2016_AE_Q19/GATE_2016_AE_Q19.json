      "reasoning": "In an ideal gas turbine engine, the thermodynamic cycle is modeled by the Brayton cycle. The combustion process (heat addition) occurs at constant pressure, making it an isobaric process. This is a standard concept in propulsion and thermodynamics. Combustion involves significant heat transfer, so it cannot be adiabatic or isentropic. It occurs at approximately constant pressure in a well-designed gas turbine combustor to facilitate continuous flow, unlike in a piston engine (Otto cycle) where it is isochoric."
