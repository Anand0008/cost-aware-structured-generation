According to NACA 4-digit series nomenclature (NACA PMTT), the second digit 'M' represents the location of the maximum camber from the leading edge in tenths of the chord. Therefore, for the maximum camber to be at 0.5c, the second digit 'M' must be 5 (since 5/10 = 0.5). Among the given options:\n*   A. NACA 5212: Second digit is 2, so max camber at 0.2c.\n*   B. NACA 1225: Second digit is 2, so max camber at 0.2c.\n*   C. NACA 2215: Second digit is 2, so max camber at 0.2c.\n*   D. NACA 2512: Second digit is 5, so max camber at 0.5c.\nThus, NACA 2512 is the correct answer."
