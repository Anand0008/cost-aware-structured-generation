This is a classic application of finite wing theory.\n\n1.  **Determine the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_0$)**:\n    For a thin symmetric airfoil in inviscid, incompressible flow, thin airfoil theory states that the lift curve slope is $2\\pi$ per radian.\n    So, $a_0 = 2\\pi$ rad$^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **Convert the angle of attack to radians**:\n    The given angle of attack is $10^{\\circ}$. To use it with the lift curve slope, we must convert it to radians:\n    $\\alpha = 10^{\\circ} \\times \\frac{\\pi \\text{ rad}}{180^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\pi}{18}$ radians.\n\n3.  **Calculate the finite wing lift curve slope ($a$)**:\n    For an untwisted elliptic wing, the finite wing lift curve slope ($a$) is related to the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_0$) and the aspect ratio (AR) by the formula:\n    $a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + a_0 / (\\pi AR)}$\n    Given $AR = 6$ and $a_0 = 2\\pi$ rad$^{-1}$:\n    $a = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 2\\pi / (\\pi \\times 6)} = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 2/6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 + 1/3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4/3}$\n    $a = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ rad$^{-1}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the lift coefficient ($C_L$)**:\n    For a symmetric airfoil (or a wing made of symmetric airfoils), the lift coefficient at a given angle of attack (measured from the zero-lift line) is given by:\n    $C_L = a \\times \\alpha$\n    Using the calculated finite wing lift curve slope $a = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ rad$^{-1}$ and the angle of attack $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{18}$ radians:\n    $C_L = \\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{18}\\right) = \\frac{3\\pi^2}{36} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12}$.\n\nThis result matches the expected answer."
