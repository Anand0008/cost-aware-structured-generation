The flow is assumed one-dimensional, steady, inviscid, and incompressible (due to 'low speed subsonic').",
        "Step 2: Recall governing principles. For incompressible, steady, inviscid flow, Bernoulli's equation ($p_A + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_A^2 = p_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_B^2$) and the continuity equation ($A_A V_A = A_B V_B$) are applicable.",

This yields: $V_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p_1 - p_2)}{\\rho \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^2\\right]}}$",
        "Calculate the area ratio term. Given the contraction ratio $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = 10$, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$. Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01$, and $1 - \\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^2 = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.",
        "Substitute the given values into the derived formula: $V_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1000)}{1.23 \\left[1 - (0.1)^2\\right]}}$",
