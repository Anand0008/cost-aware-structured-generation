      "reasoning": "Both statements [a] and [r] are true, and [r] is the correct reason for [a].\nStatement [a] asserts that in a plane stress problem, the shear strains along the thickness direction are zero, but the normal strain along the thickness is not zero. This is correct. By definition, in a plane stress state, the stress components perpendicular to the plane (z-direction) are assumed to be zero: $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$. For an isotropic material, shear strain is directly proportional to shear stress ($\\gamma = \\tau/G$). Therefore, if $\\tau_{xz} = 0$ and $\\tau_{yz} = 0$, then the corresponding shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$ must also be zero.\nHowever, the normal strain $\\epsilon_z$ is generally not zero. This is due to the Poisson effect. The generalized Hooke's Law for normal strain in the z-direction is $\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_z - \\nu\\sigma_x - \\nu\\sigma_y)$. Since $\\sigma_z = 0$ in plane stress, this simplifies to $\\epsilon_z = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$. Unless $(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$, $\\epsilon_z$ will be non-zero. Thus, statement [a] is TRUE.\n\nStatement [r] states that in a plane stress problem, the Poisson effect induces the normal strain along the thickness direction of the body. This is also correct and directly explains why $\\epsilon_z$ is non-zero, as shown by the formula $\\epsilon_z = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$. The Poisson effect describes the lateral contraction or expansion of a material in directions perpendicular to an applied axial load. Here, the in-plane normal stresses $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ induce strain $\\epsilon_z$ in the perpendicular (thickness) direction through Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. Therefore, statement [r] is TRUE and is the correct explanation for statement [a]."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the definition of a plane stress problem. In a plane stress state, the stress components perpendicular to the plane of interest are assumed to be negligible or zero. If the plane is the xy-plane, then $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{yz} = 0$.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the shear strains along the thickness direction. For isotropic linear elastic materials, shear strains are related to shear stresses by $\\gamma = \\tau/G$. Since $\\tau_{xz} = 0$ and $\\tau_{yz} = 0$ in a plane stress problem, the corresponding shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$ are also zero. This confirms the first part of statement [a].",
        "Step 3: Analyze the normal strain along the thickness direction ($\\epsilon_z$). Even though $\\sigma_z = 0$, the material still deforms in the z-direction due to the stresses acting in the x and y directions. This phenomenon is known as the Poisson effect. Using the 3D Generalized Hooke's Law, $\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_z - \\nu(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)]$. For plane stress, with $\\sigma_z=0$, this simplifies to $\\epsilon_z = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$.",
        "Step 4: From the derived formula, $\\epsilon_z = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$. Since Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ and Young's modulus $E$ are non-zero, $\\epsilon_z$ is generally non-zero unless $(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$. This confirms the second part of statement [a], that the normal strain along the thickness direction is generally non-zero.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate statement [r]. Statement [r] attributes the normal strain along the thickness direction to the Poisson effect. As established, the formula for $\\epsilon_z$ directly shows its dependence on in-plane stresses via Poisson's ratio. Therefore, statement [r] is true and provides the correct reason for the non-zero normal strain mentioned in statement [a].",
        "Step 6: Conclude that both statement [a] and statement [r] are true, and statement [r] is the correct explanation for statement [a]."
