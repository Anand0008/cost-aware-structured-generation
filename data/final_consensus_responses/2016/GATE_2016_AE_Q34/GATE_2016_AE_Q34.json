      "reasoning": "For a choked convergent nozzle, the mass flow rate is given by the formula $\\dot{m} = A^* \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$. For a given nozzle and gas, the throat area ($A^*$), specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), and specific gas constant ($R$) are constant. Therefore, the mass flow rate is directly proportional to the total pressure ($P_0$) and inversely proportional to the square root of the total temperature ($\\sqrt{T_0}$). This proportionality can be written as $\\dot{m} \\propto \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$.\n\nGiven initial conditions: $\\dot{m}_0 \\propto \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$.\n\nNew conditions: The total temperature is increased to $T_0' = 4T_0$, and the total pressure remains unchanged, $P_0' = P_0$.\n\nThe new mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}'$) will be: $\\dot{m}' \\propto \\frac{P_0'}{\\sqrt{T_0'}} = \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{4T_0}} = \\frac{P_0}{2\\sqrt{T_0}}$.\n\nComparing $\\dot{m}'$ with $\\dot{m}_0$:\n$\\dot{m}' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\right) \\propto \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_0$.\n\nThus, the mass flow rate through the nozzle becomes half of $\\dot{m}_0$."

        "Step 1: Identify the given information and governing principle. The flow through the convergent nozzle is choked, with an initial mass flow rate of μ̇_o. The total temperature is increased from T_0 to 4T_0, while the total pressure P_0 remains unchanged. For a choked convergent nozzle (exit Mach number = 1), the mass flow rate is maximum and is given by a closed-form formula derived from isentropic flow relations.",
        "Step 2: Write the choked mass flow rate formula for an ideal gas: μ̇ = \\frac{A^* P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}, where A^* is throat area, \\gamma is ratio of specific heats, and R is specific gas constant.",
        "Step 3: Identify the constant terms and dependencies. For a given nozzle and gas, the throat area (A^*), specific heat ratio (\\gamma), and specific gas constant (R) are constant. The total pressure P_0 is also constant. Therefore, the mass flow rate μ̇ is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{T_0}, i.e., μ̇ \\propto P_0 / \\sqrt{T_0}.",
        "Step 4: Apply the change in conditions. The initial mass flow rate is μ̇_o \\propto P_0 / \\sqrt{T_0}. The new conditions are: total temperature becomes T_{0,new} = 4T_0, and total pressure remains P_{0,new} = P_0. Therefore, the new mass flow rate μ̇_{new} \\propto P_0 / \\sqrt{4T_0} = P_0 / (2\\sqrt{T_0}).",
        "Step 5: Compare the new mass flow rate to the original. From Step 4, μ̇_{new} \\propto P_0 / (2\\sqrt{T_0}). Since μ̇_o \\propto P_0 / \\sqrt{T_0}, we can write μ̇_{new} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( P_0 / \\sqrt{T_0} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_o.",
