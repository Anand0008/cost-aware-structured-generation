      "reasoning": "For a linear elastic, isotropic material, the three-dimensional Hooke's law can be fully described by two independent elastic constants. This is because the material properties are uniform in all directions, and other elastic constants (like Shear Modulus G and Bulk Modulus K) can be derived from these two. The most commonly chosen independent pair are Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio (ν)."

        "Step 1: Understand the key terms. 'Isotropic material' means its mechanical properties are identical in all directions. 'Three-dimensional Hooke's law' refers to the generalized stress-strain constitutive equations for a linear elastic material under a 3D stress state.",
        "Step 2: Recall the concept of elastic constants, which are material properties quantifying elastic deformation. For a 3D stress state, Hooke's law relates six stress components to six strain components via these material constants.",
        "Step 3: In a three-dimensional stress-strain relationship, there are 6 stress components (e.g., \\sigma_{xx}, \\tau_{xy}) and 6 strain components (e.g., \\epsilon_{xx}, \\gamma_{xy}). Due to material isotropy and symmetries in the elastic stiffness tensor, the number of independent constants required to describe this relationship reduces significantly.",
        "Step 4: For an isotropic material, the Generalized Hooke's Law relates these stress and strain components using only two independent elastic constants, typically chosen as Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (\\nu).",
        "Step 5: All other elastic constants, such as the shear modulus (G) and bulk modulus (K), can be derived from E and \\nu using established relationships (e.g., G = E / (2(1+\\nu)), K = E / (3(1-2\\nu))). This demonstrates their dependency.",
