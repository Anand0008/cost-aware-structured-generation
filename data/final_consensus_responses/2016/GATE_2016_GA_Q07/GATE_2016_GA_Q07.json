(2) A research study found that 99% of women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering were successful in their professions. A logical inference must be directly supported by these statements.\n\nOption C: \"Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering.\" This is a direct and strong logical inference from the second statement. A 99% success rate clearly indicates suitability for those with advanced degrees.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n*   Option A: \"Many students have misconceptions...\" While the two statements might suggest this, the passage only states what students believe, not whether that belief is factually incorrect. Inferring \"misconceptions\" requires an external judgment not explicitly provided.\n*   Option B: \"Men with advanced degrees... believe women are well suited...\" The passage provides no information about the beliefs of men with advanced degrees.\n*   Option D: \"The number of women pursuing higher degrees... is small.\" The passage gives no data on the absolute number of women pursuing degrees, only a success rate among those who do.\n\nTherefore, only option C is a strictly logical inference from the given information."

        "Identify the two key premises: (i) 60% of students believed that mechanical engineering is a profession unsuitable for women; (ii) A research study found that 99% of women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering were successful in their professions.",
        "Understand that the task is to find a statement that can be logically inferred (i.e., necessarily concluded) from these premises without introducing external assumptions.",
        "Evaluate Option A: \"Many students have misconceptions regarding various engineering disciplines.\" While the 60% belief might be a misconception, the statement overreaches by referring to \"various engineering disciplines\" and is not a necessary inference from the given data, which focuses only on mechanical engineering.",
        "Evaluate Option B: \"Men with advanced degrees in mechanical engineering believe women are well suited to be mechanical engineers.\" The premises provide no information about the beliefs of men with advanced degrees, so this cannot be logically inferred.",
        "Evaluate Option C: \"Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering.\" The research finding of a 99% success rate for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering strongly and directly supports the conclusion that the profession is well suited for this specific group. This is a robust and direct inference.",
        "Evaluate Option D: \"The number of women pursuing higher degrees in mechanical engineering is small.\" The premises provide a success rate (percentage), not absolute numbers. Therefore, no inference can be made about the number of women.",
        "Conclude that Option C is the only statement that can be logically and directly inferred from the given information.",
