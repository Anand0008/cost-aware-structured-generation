      "reasoning": "The Prandtl number (Pr) is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$) to thermal diffusivity ($\\alpha$). It indicates the relative effectiveness of momentum and energy transport by diffusion in the boundary layer. The relationship between the velocity boundary layer thickness ($\\delta$) and the thermal boundary layer thickness ($\\delta_T$) is directly dependent on the Prandtl number:\n\n*   If $Pr = 1$, momentum and heat diffuse at the same rate, so $\\delta = \\delta_T$.\n*   If $Pr > 1$, momentum diffuses faster than heat, so $\\delta > \\delta_T$.\n*   If $Pr < 1$, heat diffuses faster than momentum, so $\\delta < \\delta_T$.\n\nThe question states that air, with a Prandtl number of 0.7, flows over a flat plate. Since $Pr = 0.7 < 1$, it means that thermal diffusion is more dominant than momentum diffusion. Consequently, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer ($\\delta_T > \\delta$). Option A is the correct statement."
