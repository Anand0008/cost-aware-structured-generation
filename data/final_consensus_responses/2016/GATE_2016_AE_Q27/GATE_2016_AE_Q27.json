      "reasoning": "The specific work done by a turbine stage ($W_s$) is determined by the Euler Turbine Equation: $W_s = u(c_{w2} - c_{w3})$, where $u$ is the mean blade speed, $c_{w2}$ is the tangential (whirl) component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet, and $c_{w3}$ is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet.\n\nThe problem states 'axial absolute flow at the entry and exit from the stage'. This implies that the tangential component of absolute velocity at the rotor exit is zero, i.e., $c_{w3} = 0$. Therefore, the specific work equation simplifies to $W_s = u c_{w2}$.\n\nGiven:\n- Specific work, $W_s = 228 \\text{ kJ/kg} = 228,000 \\text{ J/kg}$\n- Mean blade speed, $u = 440 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nFrom the simplified Euler equation, we can find $c_{w2}$:\n$c_{w2} = \\frac{W_s}{u} = \\frac{228,000 \\text{ J/kg}}{440 \\text{ m/s}} = 518.1818 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe nozzle exit angle (which is the absolute flow angle at rotor entry), $\\alpha_2$, is given as 70 degrees. In turbomachinery, $\\alpha_2$ is conventionally defined as the angle of the absolute velocity $c_2$ with the axial direction. In this convention, the tangential component $c_{w2}$ is related to the absolute velocity $c_2$ by $c_{w2} = c_2 \\sin(\\alpha_2)$.\n\nSolving for the absolute velocity at the rotor entry ($c_2$):\n$c_2 = \\frac{c_{w2}}{\\sin(\\alpha_2)} = \\frac{518.1818 \\text{ m/s}}{\\sin(70^\\circ)} = \\frac{518.1818 \\text{ m/s}}{0.93969} = 551.43 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThis value is approximately $551.5 \\text{ m/s}$, which matches option B."

      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure about trig, note that $\\sin(70^\\circ) \\approx 0.94$, so $c_2$ should be slightly larger than $c_{t2} \\approx 518$ m/s. Only option B (551.5) fits; others are far off (275, 1103, 1654). Also, estimate that typical turbine absolute velocities are a bit above blade speed. With u = 440 m/s, a plausible c2 is around 500–600 m/s.",
      "time_management": "Allocate 2-3 minutes; if stuck, use the heuristic and move on. Aim for 30–40 seconds to recall the formula and interpret angles, 30–40 seconds for calculation, and a quick sanity check."
