      "reasoning": "The pitch angle ($\\theta$) is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the horizontal. The angle of attack ($\\alpha$) is the angle between the wing chord line and the relative wind (or velocity vector). The flight path angle ($\\gamma$) is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal. These three angles are kinematically related by the equation: $\\theta = \\alpha + \\gamma$. For the pitch angle and the angle of attack to be equal (i.e., $\\theta = \\alpha$), the flight path angle ($\\gamma$) must be zero. 'Wings level constant altitude flight' (also known as level unaccelerated flight or steady level cruise flight) is the condition where the aircraft maintains a constant altitude and constant velocity, meaning its flight path is horizontal, and thus $\\gamma = 0$. In this specific flight condition, the velocity vector is horizontal, aligning the relative wind with the horizontal, which makes the pitch angle equal to the angle of attack. Options B (unaccelerated climb), C (unaccelerated descent), and D (landing) all involve a non-zero flight path angle ($\\gamma \\neq 0$), and therefore $\\theta \\neq \\alpha$."
