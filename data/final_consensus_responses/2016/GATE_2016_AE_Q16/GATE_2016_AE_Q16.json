Given the domain ($x > 0$) and the nature of the function, this is also the global minimum.\n\n**Method 2: Using AM-GM Inequality**\nFor any two positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that $a+b \\ge 2\\sqrt{ab}$. Equality holds when $a=b$.\nLet $a = x^2$ and $b = \\frac{1}{x^2}$. Since $x$ is a positive real number, $x^2$ and $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ are both positive.\nApplying the AM-GM inequality:\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\ge 2\\sqrt{x^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2}}$\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\ge 2\\sqrt{1}$\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\ge 2$\nThe minimum value of the function is 2. This minimum occurs when $x^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2}$, which implies $x^4 = 1$. Since $x$ is a positive real number, $x=1$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the function has its minima at $x=1$."
