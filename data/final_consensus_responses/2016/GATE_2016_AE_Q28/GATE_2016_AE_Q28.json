      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the total pressure ratio across an axial compressor. This is achieved by first using the definition of compressor total-to-total isentropic efficiency, \\(\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02} - T_{01}}\\), to determine the ideal (isentropic) exit total temperature, \\(T_{02s}\\). Given \\(T_{01} = 300\\,K\\), \\(T_{02} = 430\\,K\\), and \\(\\eta_c = 0.85\\), we calculate \\(T_{02s} = T_{01} + \\eta_c (T_{02} - T_{01}) = 300 + 0.85 \\times (430 - 300) = 410.5\\,K\\). Next, for an isentropic compression of a perfect gas, the relation \\(\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = \\left( \\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} \\right)^{(\\gamma - 1)/\\gamma}\\) is used. With \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\), the exponent \\((\\gamma - 1)/\\gamma\\) is \\(0.4/1.4 = 0.2857\\). The temperature ratio \\(\\frac{T_{02s}}{T_{01}} = 410.5/300 = 1.3683\\). Inverting the isentropic relation, the total pressure ratio is \\(\\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = (1.3683)^{1/0.2857} = (1.3683)^{3.5} \\approx 3.0\\). This calculated value falls within the acceptable range of 2.9 to 3.1."

        "Step 1: Identify given data. Total temperature at compressor inlet: T_t1 = 300 K. Total temperature at compressor exit: T_t2 = 430 K. Isentropic efficiency of compressor: \\(\\eta_c = 85\\% = 0.85\\). Ratio of specific heats: \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\).",
        "Step 2: Recall the definition of total-to-total isentropic efficiency for a compressor. \\(\\eta_c = \\frac{\\text{Ideal work input}}{\\text{Actual work input}} = \\frac{T_{t2s} - T_{t1}}{T_{t2} - T_{t1}}\\). Here, \\(T_{t2s}\\) is the ideal exit total temperature after an isentropic compression to the same exit pressure \\(P_{t2}\\).",

        "Step 3: Recall the isentropic relation between total temperature and total pressure for a perfect gas with constant γ. For an isentropic process: T_t2s / T_t1 = (P_t2 / P_t1)^(( γ-1)/γ). Compute the temperature ratio: T_t2s / T_t1 = 410.5 / 300 = 1.36833.",
        "Step 4: Solve for the pressure ratio (PR). PR = (P_t2 / P_t1) = (T_t2s / T_t1)^(γ/(γ-1)). Calculate the exponent: γ/(γ-1) = 1.4/(0.4) = 3.5. Therefore, PR = (1.36833)^3.5.",
        "Step 5: Compute the value. PR = (1.36833)^3.5 ≈ 2.99.",
        "Step 6: Rounding to one decimal place, the total pressure ratio across the compressor is approximately 3.0. This value falls within the acceptable GATE exam range of 2.9 to 3.1.",
