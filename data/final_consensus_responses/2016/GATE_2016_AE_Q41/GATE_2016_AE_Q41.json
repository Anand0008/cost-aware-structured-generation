        "name": "Direct Characteristic Root Method",
        "description": "The governing differential equation $m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c \\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0$ can be solved by assuming a solution of the form $x(t) = e^{\\lambda t}$. This leads to the characteristic equation $m\\lambda^2 + c\\lambda + k = 0$. The roots of this quadratic equation are $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4mk}}{2m}$. For an underdamped system, $c^2 - 4mk < 0$, leading to complex conjugate roots $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\sigma \\pm i\\omega_d$, where $\\sigma = -\\frac{c}{2m}$ is the damping coefficient and $\\omega_d = \\frac{\\sqrt{4mk - c^2}}{2m}$ is the damped oscillation frequency.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Directly from the differential equation, no need to remember ω_d formula separately. Cons: Requires solving quadratic formula and extracting imaginary part, slightly more algebra.",
        "when_to_use": "When you want to derive ω_d from first principles or if you forget the formula."
