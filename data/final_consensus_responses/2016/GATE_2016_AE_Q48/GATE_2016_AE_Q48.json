Given that 95% of the total enthalpy is recovered as kinetic energy, we can write the energy balance as: $\\frac{1}{2} v_e^2 = 0.95 \\times C_p T_0$. Solving for the exhaust velocity $v_e$: $v_e = \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.95 \\times C_p T_0}$. Substituting the given values: $T_0 = 6000\\text{ K}$ and $C_p = 5200\\text{ J/kgK}$. $v_e = \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.95 \\times 5200 \\times 6000} = \\sqrt{59280000} \\approx 7699.35\\text{ m/s}$.
