The boundary conditions are y(0) = 1 and dy/dx|_x=0 = 1.\n\n1.  **Formulate the characteristic equation:** For an ODE of the form ay'' + by' + cy = 0, the characteristic equation is am^2 + bm + c = 0. Here, a=1, b=-4, c=4. So, the characteristic equation is m^2 - 4m + 4 = 0.\n2.  **Solve the characteristic equation:** The equation can be factored as (m-2)^2 = 0. This yields a repeated real root m = 2.\n3.  **Write the general solution:** For repeated real roots m, the general solution is y(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^{mx}. Substituting m=2, we get y(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^{2x}.\n4.  **Apply the first boundary condition y(0) = 1:**\n    1 = (C_1 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^{2 \\cdot 0}\n    1 = C_1 \\cdot 1 \\implies C_1 = 1.\n5.  **Differentiate the general solution to find dy/dx:**\n    Substitute C_1=1 into the general solution: y(x) = (1 + C_2x)e^{2x}.\n    Using the product rule, dy/dx = d/dx(1 + C_2x)e^{2x} + (1 + C_2x)d/dx(e^{2x})\n    dy/dx = C_2e^{2x} + (1 + C_2x)(2e^{2x})\n    dy/dx = e^{2x}(C_2 + 2 + 2C_2x).\n6.  **Apply the second boundary condition dy/dx|_x=0 = 1:**\n    1 = e^{2 \\cdot 0}(C_2 + 2 + 2C_2 \\cdot 0)\n    1 = 1(C_2 + 2 + 0)\n    1 = C_2 + 2 \\implies C_2 = -1.\n7.  **Write the particular solution:** Substitute C_1=1 and C_2=-1 into the general solution: y(x) = (1 - x)e^{2x}.\n8.  **Evaluate y at x=1:**\n    y(1) = (1 - 1)e^{2 \\cdot 1}\n    y(1) = (0)e^2\n    y(1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of y at x=1 is 0."
