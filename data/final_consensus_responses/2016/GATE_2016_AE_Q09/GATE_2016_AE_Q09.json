      "reasoning": "The question asks for the eigenvalues of matrix $A^2$, given that $\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of matrix $A$ with corresponding eigenvectors $x$ (i.e., $Ax = \\lambda_i x$).\n\nAccording to the fundamental property of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $A$ with eigenvector $x$, then $\\lambda^k$ is an eigenvalue of $A^k$ with the same eigenvector $x$, for any positive integer $k$.\n\nFor $k=2$, we can derive this:\nGiven: $Ax = \\lambda_i x$\nTo find $A^2x$, we can write it as $A(Ax)$.\nSubstitute $Ax = \\lambda_i x$ into the expression:\n$A^2x = A(\\lambda_i x)$\nSince $\\lambda_i$ is a scalar, it can be pulled out of the matrix multiplication:\n$A^2x = \\lambda_i (Ax)$\nSubstitute $Ax = \\lambda_i x$ again:\n$A^2x = \\lambda_i (\\lambda_i x)$\n$A^2x = \\lambda_i^2 x$\n\nThis equation shows that if $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, then $x$ is also an eigenvector of $A^2$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i^2$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A^2$ are $\\lambda_i^2$. This directly matches option B."
