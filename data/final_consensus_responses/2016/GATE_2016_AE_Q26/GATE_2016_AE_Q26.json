      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the thrust per unit mass flow rate (specific thrust) of an un-mixed turbofan engine. The total specific thrust is the weighted average of the specific thrust from the core and bypass streams, weighted by their respective mass flow rates. The key steps are:\n1.  **Calculate exit velocities for both streams**: Since both nozzles are convergent and operate under choked conditions, their exit Mach number is 1. The exit velocity ($V_e$) is equal to the speed of sound ($a_e$) at the exit, given by $a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.\n    *   For the core stream: $V_{e,core} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 580} \\approx 483.73$ m/s.\n    *   For the bypass stream: $V_{e,bypass} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 295} \\approx 344.65$ m/s.\n2.  **Apply the specific thrust formula**: For an un-mixed turbofan with negligible fuel-air ratio ($f \\approx 0$) and neglecting pressure thrust (an implicit assumption as ambient pressure is not given), the specific thrust ($F_s$) per unit total mass flow rate is given by:\n    $F_s = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{core}(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\dot{m}_{bypass}(V_{e,bypass} - V_0)}{\\dot{m}_{core} + \\dot{m}_{bypass}}$\n    Using the bypass ratio $\\beta = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{bypass}}{\\dot{m}_{core}}$, this can be rewritten as:\n    $F_s = \\frac{(V_{e,core} - V_0) + \\beta (V_{e,bypass} - V_0)}{1 + \\beta}$\n3.  **Substitute the values**: Given $V_0 = 200$ m/s and $\\beta = 6.0$.\n    $F_s = \\frac{(483.73 - 200) + 6 \\times (344.65 - 200)}{1 + 6}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{283.73 + 6 \\times 144.65}{7}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{283.73 + 867.9}{7}$\n    $F_s = \\frac{1151.63}{7} \\approx 164.52$ Ns/kg.\n\nThe calculated value of $164.52$ Ns/kg falls within the provided answer key range of $162 : 166$. The alternative higher range (e.g., 1147-1150 Ns/kg) often arises from calculating the numerator sum without dividing by $(1+\\beta)$, which is a common mistake or an interpretation of thrust per unit core mass flow."
