      "reasoning": "For a completely subsonic isentropic flow through a convergent nozzle, the static pressure at the nozzle exit ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient back pressure ($P_b$). This is because in subsonic flow, pressure disturbances can propagate both upstream and downstream, allowing the flow to adjust and equilibrate with the external conditions at the exit plane. The condition 'completely subsonic' implies that the flow is unchoked, meaning the back pressure is above the critical pressure ($P_b > P^*$), and thus the exit pressure matches the back pressure."

        "Understand the 'completely subsonic' condition: This implies that the nozzle is not choked, meaning the back pressure ($P_b$) is greater than the critical pressure ($P^*$). In this unchoked state, the flow has the ability to adjust its exit pressure.",
        "Apply these principles to the convergent nozzle: For completely subsonic isentropic flow in a convergent nozzle, the flow will adjust itself such that the static pressure at the nozzle exit ($P_e$) matches the ambient back pressure ($P_b$). This is a direct consequence of the ability of subsonic flow to communicate upstream.",
