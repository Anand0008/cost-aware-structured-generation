      "reasoning": "The velocity for maximum range in gliding flight occurs at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio (L/D), which is equivalent to the maximum $C_L/C_D$. From the provided table (image), we identify the maximum $C_L/C_D$ value and its corresponding lift coefficient ($C_L$). For steady, unaccelerated gliding flight with a small glide angle, the lift force ($L$) approximately balances the weight ($W$) of the glider, i.e., $L = W$. The lift equation is given by $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. By setting $L=W$ and rearranging for velocity $V$, we get $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}}$. Substituting the given values: $W = 3300 \\text{ N}$, $\\rho = 1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $S = 14.1 \\text{ m}^2$, and the $C_L$ corresponding to maximum $C_L/C_D$ (which is $0.90$ from the table), we calculate $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3300}{1.23 \\times 14.1 \\times 0.90}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6600}{15.6123}} \\approx \\sqrt{422.74} \\approx 20.56 \\text{ m/s}$.
