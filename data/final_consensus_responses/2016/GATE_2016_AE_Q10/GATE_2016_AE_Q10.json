This statement is TRUE.\n\n*   **B. det(A+B) = det(A) + det(B):** This statement is generally FALSE. The determinant function is not additive. A simple counterexample: Let A = [[1,0],[0,1]] and B = [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then det(A) = 1 and det(B) = 1, so det(A) + det(B) = 2. However, A+B = [[2,0],[0,2]], and det(A+B) = 4. Since 2 ≠ 4, the statement is not true. This is a common misconception.\n\n*   **C. det(AA⁻¹) = 1:** Since A is non-singular, its inverse A⁻¹ exists. By definition, AA⁻¹ = I_n (the identity matrix). The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1. Therefore, det(AA⁻¹) = det(I_n) = 1. This statement is TRUE.\n\n*   **D. det(Aᵀ) = det(A):** This is a fundamental property of determinants, stating that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose. This statement is TRUE.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the statement that is NOT TRUE."

        "Step 1: Understand the objective. The question asks to identify the statement that is NOT TRUE among the given options regarding properties of determinants for non-singular n x n matrices A and B. Recall fundamental determinant properties.",
        "Step 2: Evaluate Option A: $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$. This is the product rule for determinants and is a fundamental, true property for any square matrices of the same order.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Option B: $\\det(A+B) = \\det(A) + \\det(B)$. The determinant function is not additive. This statement is generally false. For example, if A = I and B = I (identity matrices), then $\\det(A) = 1$ and $\\det(B) = 1$, so $\\det(A) + \\det(B) = 2$. However, $A+B = 2I$, and $\\det(2I) = 2^n \\det(I) = 2^n$. For n > 1, $2^n \\neq 2$. Thus, this statement is NOT TRUE.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option C: $\\det(AA^{-1}) = 1$. Since A is non-singular, its inverse $A^{-1}$ exists, and $AA^{-1} = I_n$ (the identity matrix). The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1. Therefore, $\\det(AA^{-1}) = \\det(I_n) = 1$. This statement is TRUE.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option D, `$\\det(A^T) = \\det(A)$`. This is a standard property for any square matrix, stating that the determinant of a matrix is always equal to the determinant of its transpose.",
        "Step 6: Conclude by identifying the statement that was found to be false. From the evaluation, only Option B is generally false."
