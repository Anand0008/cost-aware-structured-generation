      "reasoning": "The load factor (n) is defined as the ratio of lift (L) to weight (W), i.e., $n = L/W$. In a steady, level turn, the lift generated by the aircraft is greater than its weight, as the lift vector must provide both the vertical component to balance weight and the horizontal component for the centripetal force required for the turn. Therefore, $L = nW$. In straight and level flight, the lift simply balances the weight, so $L_{level} = W$. The general lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. The problem states that the aircraft is turning at a constant altitude (implying constant air density $\\rho$) and at the same speed (V). The wing area (S) is also constant for the same aircraft. Thus, for a given speed and altitude, lift is directly proportional to the coefficient of lift ($L \\propto C_L$).\n\n1.  **For straight and level flight:**\n    $L_{level} = W$\n    $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_{L,level}$\n    So, $C_{L,level} = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}$\n\n2.  **For turning flight:**\n    Given load factor $n = 2$.\n    $L_{turn} = nW = 2W$\n    $2W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_{L,turn}$\n    So, $C_{L,turn} = \\frac{4W}{\\rho V^2 S}$\n\n3.  **Comparing the lift coefficients:**\n    $\\frac{C_{L,turn}}{C_{L,level}} = \\frac{\\frac{4W}{\\rho V^2 S}}{\\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n\n    Therefore, $C_{L,turn} = 2 \\times C_{L,level}$. The coefficient of lift required for turning flight is double that for level flight at the same speed and altitude. This matches option C."

        "The load factor (n) is defined as the ratio of the lift force (L) to the aircraft's weight (W), i.e., $n = L/W$. For the turning flight, the load factor is given as $n=2$.",
        "Using the load factor definition, the lift required for turning flight is $L_{turn} = nW = 2W$.",
        "For straight and level flight, the lift exactly balances the weight, so $L_{level} = W$.",
        "The general aerodynamic lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$, where $\\rho$ is air density, $V$ is airspeed, $S$ is wing area, and $C_L$ is the coefficient of lift.",

        "The problem states that the flight is at constant altitude (implying constant $\\rho$) and the same speed (V). The wing area (S) is also constant. Therefore, we can compare the lift coefficients by taking their ratio: $\\frac{C_{L,turn}}{C_{L,level}} = \\frac{4W/(\\rho V^2 S)}{2W/(\\rho V^2 S)}$.",

      "Mechanics": "The principles of load factor and centripetal force in turning flight are directly related to the concepts of Newton's Laws of Motion.",
      "Structural Engineering": "Load factor determines structural loads on aircraft wings and fuselage, influencing design safety factors and material selection (e.g., for high-g military aircraft)."

      "V-n Diagram (Flight Envelope): This diagram plots load factor versus airspeed, defining the safe operating limits of an aircraft, including stall speed at various load factors and structural limits.",
      "Maneuver Speed ($V_A$): The maximum speed at which full control deflection can be applied without exceeding the structural load limit.",
      "Effect of Load Factor on Stall Speed: As load factor increases, the stall speed also increases, as more lift is required, necessitating a higher angle of attack or speed."
