      "reasoning": "The question asks how the altitude above the ground is usually measured during an aircraft's cruising flight. The correct answer is 'static pressure', which corresponds to option B. During cruising flight, the aircraft's altitude is primarily measured using an altimeter, which operates on the principle of an aneroid barometer. The altimeter senses the static air pressure from the static port and converts this pressure reading into an altitude display, calibrated according to a standard atmosphere model. This is the standard method for determining altitude during normal flight operations, providing a continuous and reliable indication of the aircraft's height. Dynamic pressure (Option A) is used for airspeed measurement. Radar (Option C) and laser range finders (Option D) measure absolute height above ground level (AGL) and are typically used during low-altitude phases like landing, not as the primary instrument for en-route cruise altitude measurement."

        "This measured static pressure is then converted into an altitude reading based on the calibrated relationship from the standard atmosphere model.",
        "Contrast with other options: Dynamic pressure is used for airspeed. Radar and laser altimeters measure height above ground (AGL) and are supplementary, not the primary method for general cruising altitude."
