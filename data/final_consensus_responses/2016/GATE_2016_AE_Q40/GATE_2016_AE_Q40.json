      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the maximum possible thickness of an open channel section such that the induced shear stress does not exceed a given limit when subjected to a specific torque. For open thin-walled sections with uniform thickness $t$, the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) due to an applied torque ($T$) is given by the formula: $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3T}{(\\sum b_i)t^2}$, where $\\sum b_i$ is the total length of the mean perimeter of the cross-section (or $L$). From the provided image, the channel section consists of a vertical web and two horizontal flanges, each of length 100 mm. The total length of the mean perimeter ($\\sum b_i$ or $L$) is $100 \\text{ mm} + 100 \\text{ mm} + 100 \\text{ mm} = 300 \\text{ mm}$. Given applied torque, $T = 62.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Nmm}$ and maximum allowable shear stress, $\\tau_{max} = 100 \\text{ N/mm}^2$. Substituting these values into the formula: $100 = \\frac{3 \\times (62.5 \\times 10^3)}{(300)t^2}$. Simplifying and solving for $t$: $100 = \\frac{187.5 \\times 10^3}{300t^2} \\Rightarrow 100 = \\frac{625}{t^2} \\Rightarrow t^2 = \\frac{625}{100} = 6.25 \\Rightarrow t = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5 \\text{ mm}$. The calculated thickness of 2.5 mm falls within the specified answer key range of 2.4 to 2.6 mm."

        "Identify the type of cross-section and list the given parameters. The section is an open channel section with uniform thickness, composed of three rectangular strips (one web and two flanges). The applied torque T = 62.5 \\times 10^3 Nmm and the maximum allowable shear stress \\tau_{max} = 100 N/mm^2 are provided.",
        "Determine the total length of the mean perimeter (L or \\sum b_i) of the open section. For the channel section shown, it consists of one vertical web (100 mm) and two horizontal flanges (100 mm each). Thus, the approximate total midline length L \\approx 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 mm. A more precise length considering thickness t would be L = (100 - t) + 2(100 - t/2) = 300 - 2t.",
        "Recall the appropriate formula for maximum shear stress in open thin-walled sections of uniform thickness t. The maximum shear stress is given by \\tau_{max} = \\frac{3T}{(L)t^2}, where L is the total midline length. This formula is derived from the torsion constant J = \\frac{1}{3} L t^3 and the general torsion relation \\tau_{max} = \\frac{T \\cdot t}{J}.",
        "Substitute the known values of T, \\tau_{max}, and the approximate L into the formula: 100 = \\frac{3 \\times (62.5 \\times 10^3)}{(300)t^2}.",
        "Solve the equation for the unknown thickness t. Simplify the right side: 100 = \\frac{187.5 \\times 10^3}{300t^2} = \\frac{625}{t^2}. Rearrange to find t^2 = \\frac{625}{100} = 6.25. Finally, t = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5 mm.",
        "Verify the result. The calculated thickness t = 2.5 mm is within the typical acceptable range for such problems (e.g., 2.4-2.6 mm).",
        "For a more precise check using L = 300 - 2t, the equation becomes t^2 (300 - 2t) = 1875. For t=2.5 mm, the left side is 6.25 \\times (300 - 5) = 6.25 \\times 295 = 1843.75. This value is slightly less than 1875, implying a slightly larger t (approx. 2.53 mm) would be needed, which is still consistent with the expected answer range."
