      "reasoning": "The thrust of a rocket engine is given by the equation: $F = \\dot{m}V_j + (P_e - P_a)A_e$, where $F$ is thrust, $\\dot{m}$ is mass flow rate, $V_j$ is jet exhaust velocity, $P_e$ is nozzle exit pressure, $P_a$ is ambient pressure, and $A_e$ is nozzle exit area. For a given chamber pressure, $\\dot{m}$, $V_j$, $P_e$, and $A_e$ are largely fixed (assuming ideal expansion to $P_e$). The only variable that changes significantly with altitude is the ambient pressure $P_a$. To maximize thrust, the term $(P_e - P_a)A_e$ must be maximized. This occurs when $P_a$ is minimized. The minimum possible ambient pressure is zero, which occurs in a vacuum. Therefore, in a vacuum, $P_a = 0$, and the thrust equation becomes $F_{vac} = \\dot{m}V_j + P_e A_e$, which represents the maximum possible thrust for the given engine configuration. Options A, C, and D describe conditions where $P_a > 0$ or where nozzle performance is degraded (normal shock), leading to lower thrust compared to vacuum."

        "Identify fixed and variable terms: For a given chamber pressure, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$), exit velocity ($V_e$), and exit pressure ($P_e$) are largely fixed by the engine design. The ambient pressure ($P_a$) is the primary variable that changes with altitude. To maximize the total thrust, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ must be maximized. This occurs when the ambient pressure ($P_a$) is minimized. The minimum possible ambient pressure is zero, which occurs in a vacuum. Therefore, the thrust of a rocket engine is highest when operating in a vacuum.",
        "Thrust F depends on ambient pressure P_a through the term (P_e - P_a) A_e. For a given engine, the thrust is maximized when this pressure-area term is maximized, which occurs as P_a decreases.",
        "The pressure-area term is maximized when the ambient pressure (P_a) is at its absolute minimum. The minimum possible P_a is zero, which occurs in a vacuum.",
        "Therefore, thrust is highest when P_a = 0, i.e., in a vacuum. This contrasts with sea-level operation where high P_a reduces thrust, or design altitude where P_e = P_a but P_a > 0, resulting in lower thrust than in vacuum."
