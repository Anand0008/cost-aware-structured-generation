Integrating $dv$ gives $v = -\\cos x$.\n3.  **Apply the formula**: Substitute these into the integration by parts formula:\n    $\\int_0^\\pi x \\sin x dx = [-x \\cos x]_0^\\pi - \\int_0^\\pi (-\\cos x) dx$\n    $\\int_0^\\pi x \\sin x dx = [-x \\cos x]_0^\\pi + \\int_0^\\pi \\cos x dx$\n4.  **Evaluate the first term**: Evaluate $[-x \\cos x]$ at the limits $0$ and $\\pi$:\n    $[-\\pi \\cos \\pi] - [-0 \\cos 0] = [-\\pi (-1)] - [0] = \\pi - 0 = \\pi$.\n5.  **Evaluate the second term**: Evaluate the remaining integral $\\int_0^\\pi \\cos x dx$:\n    $[\\sin x]_0^\\pi = \\sin \\pi - \\sin 0 = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n6.  **Combine the results**: Add the results from steps 4 and 5:\n    $\\int_0^\\pi x \\sin x dx = \\pi + 0 = \\pi$.\n\nThe numerical value of $\\pi$ is approximately $3.14159$, which falls within the specified answer key range of 3.13 to 3.15."
