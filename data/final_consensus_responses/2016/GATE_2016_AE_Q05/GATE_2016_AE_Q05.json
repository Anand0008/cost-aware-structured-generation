      "reasoning": "The correct answer is D, 'Static pressure increases, total temperature decreases.' This statement is not true across an oblique shock wave. \n\nAcross an oblique shock wave, for an ideal gas under adiabatic conditions:\n1.  **Static Pressure ($P$):** Always increases due to compression. \n2.  **Static Temperature ($T$):** Always increases as kinetic energy is converted into internal energy.\n3.  **Total Temperature ($T_0$):** Remains constant. For an adiabatic flow with no shaft work, the total energy is conserved across the shock.\n4.  **Total Pressure ($P_0$):** Always decreases. A shock wave is an irreversible process, leading to an increase in entropy and a loss of total pressure.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option D is incorrect because total temperature remains constant, it does not decrease. The other options (A, B, C) correctly describe the changes in properties across an oblique shock."

Identify how static pressure, static temperature, total (stagnation) pressure, and total (stagnation) temperature change.",
        "Recall that for an oblique shock wave, the normal component of the upstream Mach number (Mn1) behaves like a normal shock wave.",
        "Using the normal shock relations, static pressure (P) and static temperature (T) both increase across the shock, as the normal Mach number Mn1 is greater than 1. This is due to compression and the conversion of kinetic energy to internal energy.",
        "The total (stagnation) temperature ($T_0$) remains constant across the oblique shock, as the process is adiabatic with no heat transfer.",
        "The total (stagnation) pressure ($P_0$) decreases across the oblique shock due to its irreversible nature (entropy increase). This decrease is generally less than that across a normal shock for the same upstream Mach number M1.",
