By reducing the unsupported length of these stiffeners, ribs increase their critical buckling load according to Euler's formula ($P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(KL)^2}$), thereby enhancing their column buckling strength.\nStatement [r] is true: Ribs are also essential for distributing concentrated loads (e.g., from engines, landing gear) into the main wing structure and for redistributing stresses around structural discontinuities to prevent localized stress concentrations.\nHowever, [r] is not the correct reason for [a]. The increase in buckling strength (statement [a]) is due to the geometric restraint provided by ribs, which reduces the effective length of the stiffeners. The function described in [r] (load distribution and stress redistribution) is a distinct, separate function of ribs. Therefore, both statements are true, but [r] does not explain [a], making option B the correct answer."
