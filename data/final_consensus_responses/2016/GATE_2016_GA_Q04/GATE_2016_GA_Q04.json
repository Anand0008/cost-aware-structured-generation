R2D2 is a robot which can only repair aeroplanes.** This statement implies that repairing aeroplanes is the *sole* capability of R2D2. The original statements confirm R2D2 *can* repair aeroplanes, but they do not state that R2D2 *cannot* repair anything else. Therefore, this cannot be logically inferred.\n*   **B. R2D2 is the only robot which can repair aeroplanes.** This statement combines the fact that R2D2 possesses the ability to repair aeroplanes (from statement 2) with the exclusivity that no other robot possesses this ability (from statement 3). This means R2D2 is unique among robots for this specific task. This is a direct and valid logical inference.\n*   **C. R2D2 is a robot which can repair only aeroplanes.** Similar to option A, this limits R2D2's repair capabilities *only* to aeroplanes. The original statements do not provide information about what else R2D2 can or cannot repair. Thus, this cannot be logically inferred.\n*   **D. Only R2D2 is a robot.** This statement implies that R2D2 is the *sole* robot in existence. The original statements say 'R2D2 is a robot' and 'No other robot can repair aeroplanes,' but they do not preclude the existence of other robots that *cannot* repair aeroplanes. Therefore, this cannot be logically inferred.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B is the only statement that can be logically inferred from the given information."

        "Interpret the third statement, 'No other robot can repair aeroplanes.' This means that if a robot is not R2D2, it cannot repair aeroplanes. Logically, this implies that if any robot can repair aeroplanes, it must be R2D2. This can be formally stated as: $\\forall x \\left( (R(x) \\land P(x)) \\rightarrow x = \\text{R2D2} \\right)$.",

        "Option B: 'R2D2 is the only robot which can repair aeroplanes.' This statement directly matches our derived conclusion: R2D2 possesses the ability to repair aeroplanes (from statement 2) and no other robot possesses this ability (from statement 3). Therefore, this is a direct logical inference.",
        "Option C: 'R2D2 is a robot which can repair only aeroplanes.' Similar to Option A, this limits the *type* of objects R2D2 can repair. The statements do not provide information about whether R2D2 can repair other objects, so this cannot be inferred.",
        "Option D: 'Only R2D2 is a robot.' This implies R2D2 is the sole robot in existence. The third statement, 'No *other* robot can repair aeroplanes,' allows for the existence of other robots that simply cannot repair aeroplanes. Thus, this statement is too strong and cannot be inferred."
