      "reasoning": "The official answer key specifies 8.6 to 8.7 degrees. The calculation using the directional trim equation $C_{n_\\beta} \\beta + C_{n_{\\delta_r}} \\delta_r = 0$ yields $\\delta_r = -\\frac{C_{n_\\beta} \\beta}{C_{n_{\\delta_r}}}$. The sideslip angle $\\beta$ is found from the velocity triangle: $\\beta = \\arctan(v_{cross}/U) \\approx 5.194^\\circ$. Substituting $C_{n_\\beta}=0.012/\\text{deg}$, $C_{n_{\\delta_r}}=-0.0072/\\text{deg}$ gives $\\delta_r \\approx 8.66^\\circ$, which falls within the specified correct answer range of 8.6 to 8.7 degrees. The solution correctly applies the principle of yawing moment equilibrium for directional trim, balancing the moment due to sideslip with the moment generated by rudder deflection. The sideslip angle is accurately derived from the aircraft's forward velocity and the crosswind velocity. The sign conventions for $C_{n\\beta}$ and $C_{n\\delta_r}$ are handled consistently, resulting in a positive rudder deflection, which is physically appropriate for counteracting a positive sideslip (wind from the right)."

      "question_nature": "Application (combining flight mechanics and vector geometry)",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and interpret the scenario. Aircraft velocity ($U = 55$ m/s), crosswind velocity ($v_{\\text{crosswind}} = 5$ m/s), directional stability derivative ($C_{n\\beta} = 0.012/\\text{deg}$), and rudder effectiveness derivative ($C_{n\\delta_r} = -0.0072/\\text{deg}$). The aircraft is heading north, and the crosswind is from East to West, meaning the wind is coming from the right side of the aircraft.",
        "Step 2: Determine the sideslip angle ($\\beta$). Sideslip is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis (pointing north) and the incoming relative wind. With aircraft heading north, the relative wind has a component from the right (East) because the crosswind is from East to West. In body axes (x forward, y right), $u = U = 55$ m/s (north), $v = v_{crosswind} = 5$ m/s (east). Thus, $\\beta = \\arctan(v/u) = \\arctan(5/55) = \\arctan(1/11) \\approx 5.194^\\circ$. A positive $\\beta$ indicates wind from the right (starboard).",
        "Step 3: Apply the directional trim condition. For steady flight with no net yawing moment, the sum of yaw moments due to sideslip and rudder deflection must be zero: $C_{n_\\beta} \\beta + C_{n_{\\delta_r}} \\delta_r = 0$.",
        "Step 4: Solve for the required rudder deflection $\\delta_r$. Rearranging the trim equation to isolate $\\delta_r$: $\\delta_r = -\\frac{C_{n_\\beta} \\beta}{C_{n_{\\delta_r}}}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the calculated values into the equation. Given $C_{n_\\beta}=0.012$ per degree, $C_{n_{\\delta_r}}=-0.0072$ per degree, and $\\beta=5.194^\\circ$. So, $\\delta_r = -\\frac{0.012 \\times 5.194}{-0.0072} = \\frac{0.062328}{0.0072} \\approx 8.657^\\circ$.",
        "Step 6: Report the final answer. Rounding to one decimal place, the required rudder deflection is $8.7^\\circ$."
