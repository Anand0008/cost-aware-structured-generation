Since the injection velocity is greater than the circular velocity at that point and parallel to the local horizon, the injection point will be the perigee of an elliptical orbit.\n\nTherefore, the satellite forms an elliptic orbit."

For example, to achieve a circular Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at 350 km, the required velocity is about 7.7 km/s. If the stage provides 8.0 km/s (as in the problem), the satellite would enter an elliptical orbit, which may not be desired for many missions (e.g., Earth observation requires near-circular orbits).",

Given 8.0 km/s is only slightly higher, it's likely elliptical, not escape (which requires >11 km/s at surface, ~10.9 km/s at 350 km). In general, if the given speed is slightly above circular speed but far below escape speed, 'elliptic orbit' is a safe choice.",
