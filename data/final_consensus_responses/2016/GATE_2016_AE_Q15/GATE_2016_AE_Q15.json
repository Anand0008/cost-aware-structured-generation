These planes are always oriented at \\pm45^{\\circ} (which are \\pi/4 and 3\\pi/4 radians) with respect to the planes of pure shear. This is a standard result derived from stress transformation equations or Mohr's circle for pure shear (where \\sigma_x = \\sigma_y = 0 and \\tau_{xy} = \\tau). The magnitude of the shear stress (50 N/mm^2) is irrelevant for determining the angles of the principal planes. Option B matches these angles."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given stress state. The problem specifies a 'state of pure shear stress'. This implies that the normal stresses (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y) are zero, and only shear stress (\\tau_{xy}) exists on the reference planes. So, \\sigma_x = 0, \\sigma_y = 0, and \\tau_{xy} = 50 N/mm^2.",
        "Step 1: Identify the given stress state as pure shear, meaning normal stresses $\\sigma_x = 0$ and $\\sigma_y = 0$, with only shear stress $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau$ (given as $50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$).",
        "Step 2: Recall the formula for the orientation of principal planes ($\\theta_p$) relative to the x-axis: $\\tan(2\\theta_p) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the pure shear conditions ($\\sigma_x = 0, \\sigma_y = 0$) into the formula: $\\tan(2\\theta_p) = \\frac{2\\tau}{0 - 0} = \\frac{2\\tau}{0}$, which is undefined ($\\infty$).",
        "Step 4: Solve for $2\\theta_p$: Since $\\tan(2\\theta_p) = \\infty$, it implies $2\\theta_p = \\pm 90^{\\circ}$ (or $\\pm \\pi/2$ radians).",
        "Step 5: Determine the principal plane angles: From $2\\theta_p = \\pm 90^{\\circ}$, we get $\\theta_p = \\pm 45^{\\circ}$. Since principal planes are mutually perpendicular, the two principal plane orientations are $45^{\\circ}$ (or $\\pi/4$ radians) and $45^{\\circ} + 90^{\\circ} = 135^{\\circ}$ (or $3\\pi/4$ radians) relative to the plane of pure shear.",
        "Step 6: Note that the magnitude of the pure shear stress ($50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$) is not required to determine the angles of the principal planes; it only affects the magnitude of the principal stresses ($\\sigma_1 = 50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $\\sigma_2 = -50 \\text{ N/mm}^2$). This can also be visualized using Mohr's Circle, where for pure shear, the center is at the origin and the circle passes through $(\\tau, 0)$ and $(-\\tau, 0)$, with principal stresses at $(\\pm \\tau, 0)$ and principal planes rotated by $45^{\\circ}$.",
