      "reasoning": "The effective specific impulse for a multi-engine system is calculated by dividing the total thrust by the total propellant weight flow rate (or g0 times total mass flow rate). This involves calculating the mass flow rate for each engine using its individual thrust and specific impulse, summing them to get the total mass flow rate, and then using the formula $I_{sp,eff} = \\frac{\\sum F_i}{\\sum (F_i / I_{sp,i})}$. The calculated value of approximately 312.7 s falls within the acceptable range."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Calculate the total thrust ($F_{total}$) of the vehicle. Given main engine thrust = 6300 kN and two strap-on motors each with 12000 kN thrust, $F_{total} = 6300 + 2 \\times 12000 = 30300 \\text{ kN}$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the definition of specific impulse, $I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m} g_0}$. From this, the mass flow rate for each engine can be expressed as $\\dot{m} = \\frac{F}{I_{sp} g_0}$.",
        "Step 3: The effective specific impulse ($I_{sp,eff}$) can be calculated as the total thrust divided by the total mass flow rate. Since $I_{sp} = F/(\\dot{m} g_0)$, then $\\dot{m} = F/(I_{sp} g_0)$. The total mass flow rate is $\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_{main} + 2\\dot{m}_{strap}$. Thus, $I_{sp,eff} = \\frac{F_{total}}{(\\dot{m}_{main} + 2\\dot{m}_{strap}) g_0} = \\frac{F_{total}}{(\\frac{F_{main}}{I_{sp,main} g_0} + \\frac{2F_{strap}}{I_{sp,strap} g_0}) g_0}$. The $g_0$ term cancels out, simplifying the formula to $I_{sp,eff} = \\frac{F_{total}}{\\frac{F_{main}}{I_{sp,main}} + \\frac{2F_{strap}}{I_{sp,strap}}}$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the denominator of the effective specific impulse formula: $\\frac{F_{main}}{I_{sp,main}} + \\frac{2F_{strap}}{I_{sp,strap}} = \\frac{6300}{428} + \\frac{2 \\times 12000}{292} = \\frac{6300}{428} + \\frac{24000}{292} \\approx 14.7196 + 82.1918 = 96.9114$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the effective specific impulse ($I_{sp,eff}$) using the total thrust from Step 1 and the calculated denominator from Step 4: $I_{sp,eff} = \\frac{F_{total}}{\\text{denominator}} = \\frac{30300}{96.9114} \\approx 312.66 \\text{ s}$.",
        "Step 6: (Optional Verification) Alternatively, calculate individual mass flow rates: $\\dot{m}_{main} = \\frac{6300 \\times 1000}{428 \\times 9.81} \\approx 1501.2 \\text{ kg/s}$, $\\dot{m}_{strap} = \\frac{12000 \\times 1000}{292 \\times 9.81} \\approx 4190.7 \\text{ kg/s}$. Total mass flow rate: $\\dot{m}_{total} = 1501.2 + 2 \\times 4190.7 = 9882.6 \\text{ kg/s}$. Total thrust in Newtons: $F_{total} = 30300 \\times 1000 = 3.03 \\times 10^7 \\text{ N}$. Then, $I_{sp,eff} = \\frac{F_{total}}{\\dot{m}_{total} g_0} = \\frac{3.03 \\times 10^7}{9882.6 \\times 9.81} \\approx 312.7 \\text{ s}$.",
