A 40% increase in T_c means T_c_new = 1.4 * T_c_old. Therefore, Isp_new/Isp_old = sqrt(1.4) ≈ 1.1832, corresponding to an 18.32% increase, approximately 18%."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing relationship for specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) and the given conditions. The specific impulse for an ideal rocket nozzle is given by $I_{sp} = \\frac{1}{g_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{R}{M} T_c \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{p_e}{p_c}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}\\right]}$. The problem states that the new propellant has a 40% higher combustion temperature ($T_c$) and no appreciable change in molecular weight (M) or other operating parameters ($\\gamma$, $p_e/p_c$, etc.).",
        "Step 2: Based on the given conditions, all terms in the specific impulse formula except $T_c$ are constant. This leads to the proportionality: $I_{sp} \\propto \\sqrt{T_c}$.",
        "Step 3: Express the new combustion temperature ($T_{c,new}$) in terms of the old combustion temperature ($T_{c,old}$). Since the new propellant provides a 40% higher combustion temperature, $T_{c,new} = 1.40 \\times T_{c,old}$.",
        "Step 4: Formulate the ratio of the new specific impulse ($I_{sp,new}$) to the old specific impulse ($I_{sp,old}$) using the proportionality: $\\frac{I_{sp,new}}{I_{sp,old}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{c,new}}{T_{c,old}}}$. Substitute $T_{c,new} = 1.40 \\times T_{c,old}$ into the ratio: $\\frac{I_{sp,new}}{I_{sp,old}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.40 \\times T_{c,old}}{T_{c,old}}} = \\sqrt{1.40}$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the ratio and the percentage increase. $\\sqrt{1.40} \\approx 1.1832$. The percentage increase in specific impulse is then $(\\frac{I_{sp,new}}{I_{sp,old}} - 1) \\times 100\\% = (1.1832 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 18.32\\%$. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the specific impulse increases by approximately 18%."
