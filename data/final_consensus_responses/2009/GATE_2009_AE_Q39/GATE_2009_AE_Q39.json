      "reasoning": "The problem involves determining the bending moment distribution for a simply supported beam of length 2L with an overhang of length L, subjected to a clockwise end moment M at the far right end. To determine the bending moment distribution, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Coordinate System and Supports:**\n    Let the beam extend from x=0 to x=4L. The left end of the beam is at x=0. The left support (pin) is at x=L (let's call its reaction R_1). The right support (roller) is at x=3L (let's call its reaction R_2). The right end of the beam is at x=4L, where the clockwise moment M is applied.\n\n2.  **Calculate Support Reactions:**\n    A pure moment applied at the end of a statically determinate beam with simple supports will induce equal and opposite vertical reactions at the supports.\n    *   **Sum of vertical forces:** \\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies R_1 + R_2 = 0 \\implies R_2 = -R_1\n    *   **Sum of moments about the left support (at x=L), taking clockwise as positive:**\n        \\Sigma M_{x=L} = 0 \\implies R_2 \\times (2L) + M = 0\n        R_2 = -M / (2L) (This indicates a downward reaction at the right support).\n    *   **From R_1 + R_2 = 0:**\n        R_1 = -R_2 = -(-M / (2L)) = M / (2L) (This indicates an upward reaction at the left support).\n\n3.  **Derive Bending Moment (M(x)) Equations for each section:**\n    We use the method of sections, considering the left part of the beam and taking counter-clockwise internal bending moment as positive.\n\n    *   **Section 1: Left Overhang (0 \\le x < L)**\n        Consider a cut at x from the left end. There are no external forces or moments in this section.\n        M(x) = 0\n\n    *   **Section 2: Between Supports (L \\le x < 3L)**\n        Consider a cut at x from the left end. The reaction R_1 acts upwards at x=L.\n        M(x) - R_1 \\times (x - L) = 0\n        M(x) = R_1 \\times (x - L)\n        Substitute R_1 = M / (2L):\n        M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (x - L)\n        This is a linear equation.\n        At x = L (left support): M(L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (L - L) = 0 (Consistent with a simple support).\n        At x = 3L (right support): M(3L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (3L - L) = (M / (2L)) \\times (2L) = M\n\n    *   **Section 3: Right Overhang (3L \\le x \\le 4L)**\n        Consider a cut at x from the left end. Reactions R_1 and R_2 are present.\n        M(x) - R_1 \\times (x - L) - R_2 \\times (x - 3L) = 0\n        M(x) = R_1 \\times (x - L) + R_2 \\times (x - 3L)\n        Substitute R_1 = M / (2L) and R_2 = -M / (2L):\n        M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (x - L) + (-M / (2L)) \\times (x - 3L)\n        M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times [ (x - L) - (x - 3L) ]\n        M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times [ x - L - x + 3L ]\n        M(x) = (M / (2L)) \\times (2L)\n        M(x) = M\n        This is a constant positive bending moment.\n        At x = 3L (right support): M(3L) = M (Matches previous section)\n        At x = 4L (end of beam): M(4L) = M (Matches the applied end moment M).\n\n4.  **Sketch the Bending Moment Diagram:**\n    *   From x=0 to x=L (left overhang): M(x) = 0.\n    *   From x=L to x=3L (between supports): M(x) increases linearly from 0 to M.\n    *   From x=3L to x=4L (right overhang): M(x) = M (constant).\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Option B shows a bending moment diagram that is zero in the left overhang, increases linearly from zero to a maximum positive value at the right support, and then remains constant at that maximum positive value in the right overhang. This perfectly matches our derived bending moment distribution."

        "Define a coordinate system and locate the supports and load. The left support is at x=L, the right support at x=3L, and the moment M is applied at the free end of the overhang at x=4L.",
        "Calculate the support reactions using equilibrium equations (sum of forces in y direction and sum of moments about one of the supports). The applied end moment M will induce vertical reactions at the two simple supports to maintain equilibrium. These reactions are R_1 = M / (2L) (upward at left support) and R_2 = M / (2L) (downward at right support).",
        "Divide the beam into sections based on supports and load application points. For each section, make an imaginary cut and consider the equilibrium of the left (or right) part of the beam to derive the bending moment equation.",
        "For each section, derive the bending moment equation M(x) by summing moments about the cut section, using a consistent sign convention. The bending moment at the left simple support is zero. The internal bending moment at the free end of the overhang (where M is applied) must balance the applied external moment M, resulting in a net zero internal moment at the very tip.",
        "Evaluate the bending moment at critical points (supports, ends of sections) to verify continuity and determine maximum/minimum values. The bending moment will vary linearly between the supports and in the overhang section. Specifically, it starts at zero at the left support, increases linearly to a maximum at the right support, and then decreases linearly to zero at the free end of the overhang.",
        "Sketch the bending moment diagram based on the derived principles. The overall BMD will be triangular: zero at the left support, maximum at the right support, and zero again at the free end of the overhang. Compare this with the given options to select the correct one."
