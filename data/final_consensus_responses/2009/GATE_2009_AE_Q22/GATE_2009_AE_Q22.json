        "Step 1: Understand the system. The problem describes an ideal axial compressor driven by an ideal turbine, implying a single-spool gas turbine engine where the turbine's work output is entirely used to drive the compressor. Therefore, the power drawn by the compressor equals the power produced by the turbine, i.e., \\dot{W}_C = \\dot{W}_T.",
        "Step 2: Apply the specific work balance. Since fuel mass is neglected in ideal cycles, the mass flow rate through the compressor and turbine is approximately equal (\\dot{m}_a \\approx \\dot{m}_g). Thus, the specific work of the compressor equals the specific work of the turbine: w_c = w_t.",
        "Step 3: Recall the formula for specific work of an ideal turbine. For an ideal gas with constant specific heats, the specific work output of the turbine is given by w_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04}).",
        "Step 4: Identify the given values. We are given the turbine inlet total temperature T_{03} = 1500 K, the total temperature ratio across the turbine T_{04}/T_{03} = 0.667, and the specific heat of the gas c_p = 1 kJ/kg/K.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the turbine outlet total temperature (T_{04}). Using the given ratio: T_{04} = (T_{04}/T_{03}) \\times T_{03} = 0.667 \\times 1500 \\text{ K} = 1000.5 \\text{ K}.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the specific work of the turbine. Substitute the values into the specific turbine work formula: w_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04}) = 1 \\text{ kJ/kg\\cdot K} \\times (1500 \\text{ K} - 1000.5 \\text{ K}) = 499.5 \\text{ kJ/kg}.",
        "Step 7: Convert units and state the final answer. The specific work in kJ/kg is equivalent to power per unit mass flow rate in kW/(kg/s). Since w_c = w_t, the power drawn by the compressor per unit mass flow rate of air is 499.5 \\text{ kW/(kg/s)}.",
