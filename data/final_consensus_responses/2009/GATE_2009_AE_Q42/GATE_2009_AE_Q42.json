Perform necessary unit conversions, calculate the moment of inertia (I), scale the bending moment by 'n', and then apply the bending stress formula (σ = Mz/I or My/I). If calculations become overly complex, re-verify assumptions like symmetry and neutral axis location.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, first ensure unit consistency and check for powers of 10. Remember that stress is proportional to the load factor 'n', so the answer should scale accordingly. If still stuck, consider the order of magnitude of the options and which seems most plausible for the given conditions.",
