The Bredt-Batho formula for the torque carried by a single cell is $T_i = 2 A_i q_i$.\n    Assuming the applied torque is in the same direction as the shear flows $q_1$ and $q_2$ (both shown clockwise), the total torque is:\n    $T = T_1 + T_2 = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2$\n    Since $A_1 = A_2 = A$, the equation simplifies to:\n    $T = 2 A (q_1 + q_2)$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Solve:**\n    Substitute the values for $T$ and $A$ into the simplified equation:\n    $10 \\text{ N-m} = 2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^2) \\times (q_1 + q_2)$\n    $10 = (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (q_1 + q_2)$\n    Now, solve for $(q_1 + q_2)$:\n    $q_1 + q_2 = \\frac{10}{5 \\times 10^{-3}}$\n    $q_1 + q_2 = 2 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}$\n    $q_1 + q_2 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$\n\nThis derived equation, $q_1 + q_2 = 2000 \\text{ N/m}$, matches Option C."

This involves expressing strain energy in terms of shear flows and equating external work done by torque to internal energy, leading to compatibility conditions and allowing for the determination of angle of twist and shear flows.",

Multi-cell torsion problems often involve statically indeterminate systems, requiring compatibility equations (equal angle of twist) in addition to equilibrium equations (torque balance). Shear flow concepts are also relevant in analyzing trusses and frames with shear panels.",

      "Mechanics of Materials": "The Bredt-Batho formula is derived from fundamental principles of mechanics of materials, relating shear stress, shear flow, and torsional deformation. Torsion of solid shafts ($\\tau = Tr/J$) can be seen as a limiting case of thin-walled theory."
