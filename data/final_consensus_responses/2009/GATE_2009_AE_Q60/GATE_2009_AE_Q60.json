      "reasoning": "This question is linked to a previous question (Q.59) which asks for the change in specific internal energy. To solve Q.60, we first need the result from Q.59.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the change in total internal energy ($\\Delta U$) for the air (from linked Q.59 context).**\n*   The system is 1 kg of air in a cylinder.\n*   Work done *on* the air by the piston is 3000 W. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics convention ($\\Delta U = Q - W$, where $W$ is work done *by* the system), work done *on* the system is negative work *by* the system. So, $\\dot{W} = -3000$ W.\n*   Heat is lost *from* the air through the walls at a rate of 847.5 W. According to the First Law convention, heat lost *from* the system is negative heat *added to* the system. So, $\\dot{Q} = -847.5$ W.\n*   The process occurs for a duration of $t = 10$ seconds.\n*   Total work done *by* the system: $W = \\dot{W} \\times t = (-3000 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -30000 \\text{ J}$.\n*   Total heat added *to* the system: $Q = \\dot{Q} \\times t = (-847.5 \\text{ W}) \\times (10 \\text{ s}) = -8475 \\text{ J}$.\n*   Applying the First Law of Thermodynamics: $\\Delta U = Q - W = (-8475 \\text{ J}) - (-30000 \\text{ J}) = -8475 \\text{ J} + 30000 \\text{ J} = 21525 \\text{ J}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the change in specific internal energy ($\\Delta u$).**\n*   Given mass of air $m = 1$ kg.\n*   $\\Delta u = \\Delta U / m = 21525 \\text{ J} / 1 \\text{ kg} = 21525 \\text{ J/kg}$. (This is the answer to Q.59).\n\n**Step 3: Relate specific internal energy change to temperature change (for Q.60).**\n*   For an ideal gas, the change in specific internal energy is related to the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$) and the change in temperature ($\\Delta T$) by the formula: $\\Delta u = c_v \\Delta T$.\n*   Given $c_v = 717.5$ J/kg-K.\n*   Rearranging the formula to find $\\Delta T$: $\\Delta T = \\Delta u / c_v$.\n*   Substituting the values: $\\Delta T = 21525 \\text{ J/kg} / 717.5 \\text{ J/kg-K} = 30 \\text{ K}$.\n\nThis result matches option (C)."

        "industry_example": "In gas turbine engines, understanding specific heats is crucial for both compressor and combustor design. In the compressor, work done on the air increases its temperature (e.g., a 10:1 pressure ratio can lead to ~200 K rise). In the combustor, the air-fuel mixture is heated significantly (e.g., from 300 K to 1000 K). Accurate prediction of these temperature changes is vital for selecting appropriate materials for components like turbine blades and for designing efficient cooling systems.",
        "why_it_matters": "Accurate calculation of temperature changes is critical. Underestimating temperature rise can lead to thermal fatigue, creep, and eventual failure of critical engine components, compromising safety and performance. Conversely, overestimating can result in over-engineered, heavier, less efficient designs, and unnecessary complexity in cooling systems."

The work input (3000 W) is significantly larger than heat loss (847.5 W), so net energy is added, implying an increase in internal energy and temperature (positive $\\Delta T$). If unsure, note that options have $\\pm21.4$ and $\\pm30$. Since $c_p$ and $c_v$ differ by ~$R$ (287 J/kgK for air), and $21.5 \\text{ kJ/kg} / 717.5 \\text{ J/kgK} \\approx 30 \\text{ K}$, 30 K likely corresponds to a work magnitude around 21.5 kJ/kg. Guess C if you see work magnitude around that.",
