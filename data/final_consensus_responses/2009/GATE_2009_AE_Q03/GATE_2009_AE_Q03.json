      "reasoning": "A trailing edge plain flap deflected downward increases the lift coefficient of an airfoil primarily by increasing the effective camber of the airfoil. This increase in camber shifts the lift curve upwards, leading to a higher lift coefficient at a given angle of attack and an increased maximum lift coefficient (C$_{L,max}$) achievable before stall.

        "Explain how increased camber leads to higher lift: The more curved shape enhances the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, resulting in a higher lift coefficient (C_L) at a given angle of attack and an increased maximum lift coefficient (C_L,max).",
