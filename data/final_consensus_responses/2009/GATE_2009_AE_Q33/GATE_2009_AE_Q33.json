      "reasoning": "The correct answer is A, which includes the statements: P. Stagnation temperature stays constant, Q. Stagnation pressure decreases, and R. Entropy increases. This is consistent with the fundamental principles of normal shock waves:\n\n1.  **Stagnation temperature ($T_0$) stays constant (Statement P):** The energy equation for a control volume across a stationary normal shock, assuming adiabatic flow (no heat transfer) and no shaft work, shows that the stagnation enthalpy ($h_0 = h + \\frac{V^2}{2}$) is conserved. For an ideal gas, $h_0 = C_p T_0$, which implies that stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant across the shock ($T_{01} = T_{02}$). This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n2.  **Stagnation pressure ($P_0$) decreases (Statement Q):** A normal shock wave is an irreversible process. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy must increase across an irreversible process. This increase in entropy is directly linked to a decrease in stagnation pressure. Therefore, the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock ($P_{02}$) is always less than the stagnation pressure upstream ($P_{01}$). This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Statement S (Stagnation pressure increases) is therefore false.\n\n3.  **Entropy increases (Statement R):** As mentioned, a normal shock is an irreversible process. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that for any irreversible process occurring in an isolated system (or across a control volume with no external entropy transfer), the entropy of the system must increase. Thus, $s_2 > s_1$. This is consistently stated in RAG Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n4.  **Stagnation temperature increases (Statement T):** This contradicts statement P and the conservation of stagnation temperature across a normal shock. While static temperature ($T$) increases across a normal shock, stagnation temperature ($T_0$) remains constant. Therefore, statement T is false.\n\nCombining these, statements P, Q, and R are true. This corresponds to Option A."

        "Step 2: Recall the governing principles for a normal shock: conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. Crucially, a normal shock is an irreversible, adiabatic process, meaning entropy must increase across it, and it is not isentropic.",
        "Step 3: Analyze statement P (Stagnation temperature stays constant). Apply the energy conservation principle. For adiabatic flow across a stationary normal shock, the stagnation enthalpy (h₀) is conserved. For an ideal gas, this implies stagnation temperature (T₀) is conserved (T₀₁ = T₀₂). Therefore, P is TRUE, and T (stagnation temperature increases) is FALSE.",
        "Step 4: Analyze statement Q (Stagnation pressure decreases). Due to the irreversible nature of the normal shock process, there is a loss of useful work potential. This manifests as a decrease in stagnation pressure across the shock (P₀₂ < P₀₁). Therefore, Q is TRUE.",

        "Step 6: Analyze statement S (Stagnation pressure increases). This contradicts the finding that stagnation pressure decreases due to irreversibility. Therefore, S is FALSE.",
