        "Identify the governing principle: The maximum velocity attainable by a rocket in the absence of gravity and atmospheric drag is determined by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.",
        "State the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: The ideal change in velocity ($\\Delta V$) is given by $\\Delta V = g I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_i}{M_f}\\right)$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $I_{sp}$ is the specific impulse, $M_i$ is the initial total mass, and $M_f$ is the final (burnout) mass.",
        "Define the initial mass ($M_i$) based on the given parameters: The initial mass of the rocket is its total mass, $M_0$. So, $M_i = M_0$.",
        "Define the final mass ($M_f$) based on the given parameters: The final mass, also known as the burnout mass, is the mass remaining after all propellant ($M_P$) has been consumed. This includes the structural mass ($M_S$) and the payload mass ($M_L$). Therefore, $M_f = M_S + M_L$.",
        "Relate the final mass to the initial mass and propellant mass: The total initial mass $M_0$ is the sum of the propellant mass ($M_P$), structural mass ($M_S$), and payload mass ($M_L$). Thus, $M_0 = M_P + M_S + M_L$. From this, we can deduce that $M_S + M_L = M_0 - M_P$. Therefore, $M_f = M_0 - M_P$.",
        "Substitute the expressions for $M_i$ and $M_f$ into the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: This yields the maximum velocity as $V_b = g I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_0 - M_P}\\right)$.",
        "Address the condition \"in the absence of gravity and atmospheric drag\": In this context, the term 'g' (acceleration due to gravity) is often omitted or considered absorbed into the specific impulse when expressing the effective exhaust velocity. Thus, the equation simplifies to $V_b = I_{sp} \\ln \\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_0 - M_P}\\right)$.",
