      "reasoning": "The propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) of a jet engine is defined as the ratio of the useful thrust power to the total power imparted to the jet. The useful thrust power is $F \\times U_\\infty$, where $F$ is thrust and $U_\\infty$ is flight velocity. The total power imparted to the jet is the sum of the useful thrust power and the kinetic energy rate lost in the jet, which is $F \\times U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $U_e$ is the exhaust velocity relative to the engine. \n\nUsing the thrust equation $F = \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)$ (assuming negligible pressure thrust and fuel mass flow), the propulsive efficiency can be derived as:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{F \\times U_\\infty}{F \\times U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \n\nSubstitute $F = \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)$ into the denominator:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty}{\\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \n\nCancel $\\dot{m}$ from all terms:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{(U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty}{(U_e - U_\\infty) U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} (U_e - U_\\infty)^2}$ \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by $(U_e - U_\\infty)$:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{U_\\infty}{U_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} (U_e - U_\\infty)}$ \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{2 U_\\infty + (U_e - U_\\infty)}$ \n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{U_e + U_\\infty}$ \n\nThis formula is directly provided in RAG chunks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, confirming option D as the correct answer. For instance, RAG chunk 3 shows the derivation to $\\eta_p = \\frac{2c_i}{c_j + c_i}$, where $c_i$ is flight velocity ($U_\\infty$) and $c_j$ is exhaust velocity ($U_e$). RAG chunk 2 and 4 provide $\\eta_p = \\frac{2}{1 + V_e/V_\\infty}$, which is equivalent to option D by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $V_\\infty$ (or $U_\\infty$).\n\n$\\eta_p = \\frac{2}{1 + \\frac{U_e}{U_\\infty}} = \\frac{2 \\times U_\\infty}{(1 + \\frac{U_e}{U_\\infty}) \\times U_\\infty} = \\frac{2 U_\\infty}{U_\\infty + U_e}$"

      "Thermodynamics": "The concept of efficiency is central to thermodynamics (e.g., thermal efficiency of cycles). Propulsive efficiency is a mechanical efficiency that complements thermal efficiency to give overall engine efficiency. The power lost in the exhaust jet is related to the kinetic energy of the exhaust, which is also a thermodynamic concept.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The thrust equation and the kinetic energy of the exhaust jet are derived from principles of fluid mechanics, specifically the momentum equation and energy conservation (control volume analysis).",
      "Flight Mechanics": "Propulsive efficiency directly impacts aircraft performance parameters like range, endurance, and fuel consumption, which are core topics in flight mechanics. Thrust power (F*V) is directly used in aircraft performance equations."
