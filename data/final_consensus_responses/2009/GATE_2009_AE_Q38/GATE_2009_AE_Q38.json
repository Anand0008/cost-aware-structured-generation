The local Reynolds number is $\\text{Re}_x = \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty} x}{\\mu_{\\infty}}$. Substituting $\\text{Re}_x$ into the $\\delta$ formula, we get $\\delta = \\frac{C \\cdot x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty} x}{\\mu_{\\infty}}}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\infty} x}{\\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}}}$.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the free stream velocity $V_{\\infty}$, i.e., $\\delta \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V_{\\infty}}}$.\n\nGiven:\nInitial boundary layer thickness $\\delta_1 = 7.2 \\text{ mm}$\nInitial free stream speed $V_1$\nNew free stream speed $V_2 = 1.5 V_1$ (increased by 50%)\n\nWe need to find the new boundary layer thickness $\\delta_2$. Using the proportionality:\n$\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{V_2}}{1/\\sqrt{V_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_1}{V_2}}$\n\nSubstitute $V_2 = 1.5 V_1$:\n$\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_1}{1.5 V_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.5}}$\n\n$\\delta_2 = \\delta_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.5}} = 7.2 \\text{ mm} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.5}}$\n$\\delta_2 = 7.2 \\text{ mm} \\times \\sqrt{0.666...} \\approx 7.2 \\text{ mm} \\times 0.8165$\n$\\delta_2 \\approx 5.8788 \\text{ mm}$\n\nRounding to one decimal place, $\\delta_2 \\approx 5.9 \\text{ mm}$.
