      "reasoning": "To determine where the function $f(x) = e^{\\pi x} + \\sin(\\pi x)$ is maximum in the interval $1 \\le x \\le 2$, we first analyze its monotonicity by examining the sign of its first derivative, $f'(x)$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the first derivative:**\n    $f(x) = e^{\\pi x} + \\sin(\\pi x)$\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^{\\pi x}) + \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(\\pi x))$\n    Using the chain rule, we get:\n    $f'(x) = \\pi e^{\\pi x} + \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)$\n    $f'(x) = \\pi (e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x))$\n\n2.  **Analyze the sign of $f'(x)$ in the interval $[1, 2]$:**\n    We need to determine if $e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x)$ is positive, negative, or zero for $x \\in [1, 2]$.\n    *   For $x \\in [1, 2]$, the exponential term $e^{\\pi x}$ is always positive and strictly increasing. Its minimum value at $x=1$ is $e^{\\pi} \\approx 23.14$.\n    *   For $x \\in [1, 2]$, the argument $\\pi x$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$. In this range, $\\cos(\\pi x)$ varies between $-1$ and $1$.\n    *   Since $e^{\\pi x} \\ge e^{\\pi} \\approx 23.14$ and $\\cos(\\pi x) \\ge -1$, the sum $e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x) \\ge e^{\\pi} - 1 \\approx 23.14 - 1 = 22.14$.\n    *   Since $22.14 > 0$, the term $(e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x))$ is always positive in the interval $[1, 2]$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Monotonicity:**\n    Since $\\pi$ is a positive constant and $(e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x))$ is always positive in $[1, 2]$, $f'(x) = \\pi (e^{\\pi x} + \\cos(\\pi x))$ is always positive for $x \\in [1, 2]$.\n    A function with a positive first derivative over an interval is monotonically increasing on that interval.\n\n4.  **Locate the Maximum:**\n    For a monotonically increasing function on a closed interval $[a, b]$, the maximum value occurs at the right endpoint, $x=b$.\n    In this case, the interval is $[1, 2]$, so the maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x=2$."
