      "reasoning": "The question asks for the stress conditions that define a plane strain problem. In a plane strain condition, the strains perpendicular to the plane of interest (typically the xy-plane) are assumed to be zero. Specifically, for plane strain in the xy-plane, the following strain components are zero:\n1.  $\\epsilon_z = 0$\n2.  $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$\n3.  $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$\n\nUsing the generalized Hooke's Law for an isotropic material:\n*   From $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$, we have $\\tau_{xz} = G \\gamma_{xz} = 0$. (Where G is the shear modulus)\n*   From $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$, we have $\\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz} = 0$.\n*   From $\\epsilon_z = 0$, and the Hooke's Law equation for normal strain in the z-direction: $\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} [\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)]$. Since $\\epsilon_z = 0$, this simplifies to $\\sigma_z - \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$, which means $\\sigma_z = \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$.\n\nCombining these, the stress conditions for a plane strain problem are $\\tau_{xz} = 0$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$, and $\\sigma_z = \\nu (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$. This matches option B. Option A incorrectly sets $\\sigma_z = 0$, which is the plane stress condition. Options C and D add incorrect dependence on $\\tau_{xy}$."
