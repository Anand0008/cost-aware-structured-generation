      "reasoning": "The shear center is defined as the point in the cross-section of a beam through which the applied transverse shear force must pass to produce pure bending without any twisting (torsion) of the beam. For thin-walled open sections, a key principle is that if all individual elements of the section meet at a common junction point, and the resultant shear force in each element passes through this junction, then the shear center of the entire section lies at that junction point. In the given figure, the thin-walled beam cross-section consists of elements AB, BC, and BD. All three elements converge and meet at point B. In thin-walled open sections, shear flow starts from zero at any free edge (points A, C, and D) and builds up towards the interior of the section. The shear flow in each segment (AB, BC, and BD) will generate a resultant shear force acting along the length of that segment. Since all three segments are connected at point B, the resultant shear force from each segment will pass through point B. Therefore, the shear center for this cross-section lies at the junction point B, which is a standard result for such angle or cruciform sections."
