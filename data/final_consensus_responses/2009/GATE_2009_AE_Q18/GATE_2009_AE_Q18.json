      "reasoning": "For a critically damped single degree of freedom system, the damping ratio $\\zeta$ is equal to 1. The damping ratio is defined as $\\zeta = c / (2 \\sqrt{m k})$. Setting $\\zeta = 1$, we get $c = 2 \\sqrt{m k}$, where $c$ is the damping constant, $m$ is the mass, and $k$ is the spring constant. Squaring both sides and rearranging for $m$ gives $m = c^2 / (4k)$. Substituting the given values $c = 4 \\text{ Ns/m}$ and $k = 16 \\text{ N/m}$: $m = (4)^2 / (4 \\times 16) = 16 / 64 = 0.25 \\text{ kg}$. This value matches option B."

        "Step 4: For critical damping, set $\\zeta = 1$: $1 = \\frac{c}{2 \\sqrt{m k}}$.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with m: $2 \\sqrt{m k} = c$.",
        "Step 6: Further rearrange: $\\sqrt{m k} = \\frac{c}{2}$.",
        "Step 7: Square both sides: $m k = \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{c^2}{4}$.",
        "Step 8: Solve for m: $m = \\frac{c^2}{4k}$.",
        "Step 9: Substitute the given values c = 4 Ns/m and k = 16 N/m into the formula.",

        "Step 12: Final result: m = 0.25 \\text{ kg}.",
