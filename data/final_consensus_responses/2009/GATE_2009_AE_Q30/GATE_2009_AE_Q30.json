The angle of attack ($\\alpha$) and sideslip angle ($\\beta$) define the orientation of this velocity vector relative to the body axes.\n\n1.  **Sideslip Angle ($\\beta$):** The sideslip angle $\\beta$ is defined as the angle between the total velocity vector $\\vec{V}$ and the XZ-body plane. Geometrically, this means the component of the velocity along the Y-body axis ($v$) is given by:\n    $\\qquad v = V \\sin\\beta$\n    The projection of the total velocity vector onto the XZ-body plane, let's denote its magnitude as $V_{xz}$, is then:\n    $\\qquad V_{xz} = V \\cos\\beta$\n\n2.  **Angle of Attack ($\\alpha$):** The angle of attack $\\alpha$ is defined as the angle between the X-body axis and the projection of the velocity vector onto the XZ-body plane ($V_{xz}$). Within the XZ-plane, the components $u$ (along X-body) and $w$ (along Z-body) can be resolved from $V_{xz}$ as:\n    $\\qquad u = V_{xz} \\cos\\alpha$\n    $\\qquad w = V_{xz} \\sin\\alpha$\n\n3.  **Combining the relations:** Substitute the expression for $V_{xz}$ from step 1 into the equations for $u$ and $w$ from step 2:\n    $\\qquad u = (V \\cos\\beta) \\cos\\alpha = V \\cos\\beta \\cos\\alpha$\n    $\\qquad w = (V \\cos\\beta) \\sin\\alpha = V \\cos\\beta \\sin\\alpha$\n\nTherefore, the complete set of relations for the body-fixed velocity components is:\n*   $u = V \\cos\\beta \\cos\\alpha$\n*   $v = V \\sin\\beta$\n*   $w = V \\cos\\beta \\sin\\alpha$\n\nComparing this derived set with the given options, option D matches perfectly."

Then, a series of rotation matrices are applied to transform this vector into the body-fixed frame.
