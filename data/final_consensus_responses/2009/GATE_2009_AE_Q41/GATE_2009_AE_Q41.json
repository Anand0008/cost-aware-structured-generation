      "reasoning": "The question asks for the buckling load of a simply supported column. This requires the application of Euler's buckling formula. First, identify the given parameters and convert them to consistent units (SI units). Then, calculate the minimum moment of inertia (I_min) for the rectangular cross-section, as buckling occurs about the weakest axis. For a simply supported column, the effective length factor (K) is 1. Finally, substitute these values into Euler's critical buckling load formula.\n\nGiven:\nLength, $L = 0.5 \\text{ m}$\nCross-section dimensions: $1 \\text{ cm} \\times 1.5 \\text{ cm}$\nModulus of Elasticity, $E = 210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$\nEnd condition: Simply supported (pin-pin), so effective length factor $K = 1$.\n\n1.  **Convert dimensions to meters:**\n    $b_1 = 1 \\text{ cm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}$\n    $b_2 = 1.5 \\text{ cm} = 0.015 \\text{ m}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the minimum moment of inertia ($I_{\\text{min}}$):**\n    For a rectangular cross-section, $I = \\frac{1}{12}bh^3$. Buckling will occur about the axis with the smaller moment of inertia. This happens when the 'h' (dimension cubed) is the smaller of the two cross-sectional dimensions. So, we take $b = 0.015 \\text{ m}$ and $h = 0.01 \\text{ m}$.\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\times (0.015 \\text{ m}) \\times (0.01 \\text{ m})^3$\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 0.015 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-2})^3$\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 0.015 \\times 1 \\times 10^{-6}$\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{12} \\times 10^{-6}$\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = 0.125 \\times 10^{-2} \\times 10^{-6}$\n    $I_{\\text{min}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$\n\n3.  **Apply Euler's Critical Buckling Load formula:**\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{\\text{min}}}{(KL)^2}$\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times (210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(1 \\times 0.5 \\text{ m})^2}$\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\times 210 \\times 1.25}{0.25}$\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} = 9.8696 \\times 210 \\times 5$\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} = 10363.08 \\text{ N}$\n    $P_{\\text{cr}} \\approx 10.36 \\text{ kN}$\n\nThis value is approximately $10 \\text{ kN}$, which matches option A."
