      "reasoning": "The division of feed air into primary and secondary (and dilution) streams in a gas-turbine combustor serves several critical purposes.\n\n**P. a flammable mixture can be formed:** The primary air stream (typically 15-20% of total air) is mixed with fuel to create a near-stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (around 15:1). This rich mixture is highly flammable and essential for stable ignition and sustained combustion in the primary zone. Without this, the overall lean air-fuel ratio would not support a stable flame.\n\n**Q. cooling of combustor liner and flame tube can be accomplished:** A significant portion of the secondary and dilution air is directed along the combustor liner walls. This forms a cooling film, protecting the liner from the extremely high temperatures of combustion. This is a crucial structural consideration and a direct purpose of the air distribution.\n\n**R. specific fuel consumption can be reduced:** While efficient combustion (enabled by proper air staging) contributes to overall engine efficiency and thus can indirectly lead to lower specific fuel consumption (SFC), the *division of air streams itself* is not a direct mechanism for reducing SFC. Its primary roles are flame stability, complete combustion, and temperature/liner control. SFC is more directly influenced by overall engine cycle parameters and component efficiencies.\n\nTherefore, statements P and Q are direct purposes of dividing the feed air."

        "The overall air-fuel ratio in a gas turbine combustor is very lean (typically 60:1 to 120:1) to achieve the desired Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT). However, such a lean mixture cannot sustain a stable flame.",
        "To overcome this, the combustor airflow is divided into distinct zones: primary, secondary, and dilution.",
        "In the primary zone, only a fraction of the total air (typically 15-20%) is introduced and mixed with fuel. This creates a near-stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (around 15:1), which is essential for forming a flammable mixture and ensuring stable and efficient combustion (Purpose P).",
        "The remaining air is introduced downstream. Secondary air is injected to complete the combustion of any unburnt fuel and to begin cooling the gas stream. Further downstream, dilution air is mixed with the hot combustion products to cool the gas down to the specific Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) that the turbine blades can safely handle. Additionally, air introduced through the liner walls provides film cooling to protect the combustor liner and flame tube from high temperatures (Purpose Q).",
        "Regarding specific fuel consumption (SFC), while efficient combustion (facilitated by the zonal design) contributes to better engine performance, the division of air streams is not a direct mechanism for reducing SFC. SFC is primarily influenced by thermodynamic cycle parameters and component efficiencies. Therefore, statement R is not a direct purpose.",

To solve this, the combustor is divided into three distinct zones. In the Primary Zone, only a fraction of the total air (primary air) is introduced, keeping the A/F ratio close to stoichiometric to ensure stable, efficient, and rapid combustion. In the final section, the Dilution Zone, a large quantity of dilution air is mixed with the combustion products. The sole purpose of this air is to cool the gas stream down to the specific TIT that the turbine can safely handle, and also for liner cooling. Air is admitted into the liner through a series of carefully designed holes or slots.",
