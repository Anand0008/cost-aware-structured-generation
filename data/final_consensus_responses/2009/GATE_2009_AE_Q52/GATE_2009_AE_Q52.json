Engineers analyze and measure the Short Period damped frequency during design and flight testing phases (e.g., for aircraft like the Boeing 787 or F-35) to ensure it meets handling qualities specifications like MIL-F-8785C and responds predictably and comfortably to pilot inputs and atmospheric disturbances.",

For instance, when the term $Z_\\alpha M_q/U_1$ is small compared to $M_\\alpha$, the short period natural frequency can be approximated as $\\omega_{n_{SP}} = \\sqrt{-M_\\alpha}$, where $M_\\alpha$ is the pitching moment coefficient derivative with respect to angle of attack. More generally, one can first calculate the Short Period natural frequency `$\\omega_{n_{sp}}$` and damping ratio `$\\zeta_{sp}$` (e.g., `$\\zeta_{sp} = -(M_q + Z_\\alpha/U_1) / (2 \\omega_{n_{sp}})$`).
