      "reasoning": "The rate of climb ($V_c$) is defined as the excess power ($P_{excess}$) divided by the aircraft's weight ($W$). First, calculate the weight of the aircraft: $W = m \\times g$. Given mass $m = 2500 \\text{ kg}$, if we use standard acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$, the weight is $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 24500 \\text{ N}$. Then, apply the rate of climb formula: $V_c = P_{excess} / W = (1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}) / (24500 \\text{ N}) \\approx 40.816 \\text{ m/s}$. This value is closest to 40 m/s. If $g=10 \\text{ m/s}^2$ is assumed (a common simplification in some GATE problems to yield exact integer answers), then $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 25000 \\text{ N}$, leading to $V_c = (1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}) / (25000 \\text{ N}) = 40 \\text{ m/s}$ exactly. The given speed (100 m/s) is not needed for this calculation."

        "Identify the given parameters: mass of the aircraft ($m$) = 2500 kg, available excess power ($P_{excess}$) = $1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}$. Note that the constant speed (100 m/s) is not directly required for this calculation. The fundamental principle for steady climb is that the rate of climb ($V_c$) is determined by the excess power divided by the aircraft's weight.",
        "Calculate the weight ($W$) of the aircraft using the formula $W = m \\times g$. Assuming standard acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$, we get $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 24500 \\text{ N}$. (Alternatively, if $g=10 \\text{ m/s}^2$ is assumed for simpler calculation, $W = 2500 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 25000 \\text{ N}$).",
        "Step 3: Calculate weight $W$ from mass $m=2500 \\text{ kg}$ using acceleration due to gravity $g=9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$: $W = m \\times g = 2500 \\times 9.8 = 24500 \\text{ N}$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute given excess power $P_{\\text{excess}}=1.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}$ into the formula: $R/C = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^6}{24500}$.",
        "Step 5: Perform the division: $R/C \\approx 40.816 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 6: Compare the result with the given options. The calculated value $40.816 \\text{ m/s}$ is approximately $40 \\text{ m/s}$, which corresponds to option C. (Note: If $g=10 \\text{ m/s}^2$ was used, the result would be exactly $40 \\text{ m/s}$)."
