      "reasoning": "For a choked convergent nozzle, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is given by the equation: $\\dot{m} = A_{throat} \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$. The problem states that the nozzle is choked, the total pressure ($P_0$) remains the same, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) remains the same, and the specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$) remains constant. The gas constant ($R$) is also constant. Therefore, all terms except $A_{throat}$ and $\\sqrt{T_0}$ are constant. This implies that $\\frac{A_{throat}}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$ must remain constant, or $A_{throat} \\propto \\sqrt{T_0}$. We need to find the factor by which the nozzle area changes, which is the ratio $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}}$. This can be expressed as $\\frac{A_{on}}{A_{off}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{0,on}}{T_{0,off}}}$. Given $T_{0,off} = 750\\text{ K}$ and $T_{0,on} = 3000\\text{ K}$, we calculate the ratio as $\\sqrt{\\frac{3000}{750}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. Thus, the nozzle area must be changed by a factor of 2."

Recall that for fixed mass flow rate and total pressure, area (A) is proportional to the square root of total temperature (\\(A \\propto \\sqrt{T_0}\\)). Compute the temperature ratio (3000/750=4) and take its square root (2). This should be a quick calculation.",
