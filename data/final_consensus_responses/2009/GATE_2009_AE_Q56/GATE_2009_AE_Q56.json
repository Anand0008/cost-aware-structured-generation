      "reasoning": "The question states the nth mode shape of torsional vibration as $\\sin(n\\pi x / L)$. Mathematically, this mode shape is typically associated with a shaft fixed at both ends (or free at both ends), for which the nth natural frequency is $\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}$ (Option A). However, the provided answer key is B, which is $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}$. This frequency expression, along with its corresponding mode shape $\\sin(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L})$, is characteristic of a fixed-free (or free-fixed) torsional shaft. There is a clear inconsistency between the mode shape given in the question and the frequency provided in Option B. For the purpose of this analysis, we acknowledge the answer key as B, but highlight the discrepancy with the question's premise. If the question intended a fixed-free shaft, then option B would be correct, but the mode shape given in the question would be incorrect."

        "Identify the governing equation for free torsional vibration of a uniform shaft: `\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}`, where `c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}`. Here, `I` is the mass moment of inertia per unit length and `GJ` is the torsional rigidity.",
        "Assume a separable solution `\\theta(x,t) = \\phi(x) \\cos(\\omega t)`. Substituting into the governing equation leads to the spatial ordinary differential equation: `\\frac{d^2 \\phi}{dx^2} + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 \\phi = 0`.",
        "The general solution for the spatial part is `\\phi(x) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right) + B \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega x}{c}\\right)`.",
        "The given `n`-th mode shape is `\\phi_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x / L)`. Comparing this with the general solution, we find that `B=0` and `\\frac{\\omega_n}{c} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}`.",
        "From `\\frac{\\omega_n}{c} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}`, we get `\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi c}{L}`. Substitute `c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}` to obtain the natural frequency: `\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}`.",
        "This derived natural frequency `\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}` corresponds to a shaft fixed at both ends, which is consistent with the given mode shape `\\sin(n\\pi x/L)`. However, if the official answer key points to `\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{GJ}{I}}`, this formula is for a fixed-free shaft. Given the official answer, it implies that either the boundary conditions were implicitly fixed-free, or the 'n' in the mode shape was intended to represent `(2n+1)/2` for a fixed-free case."
