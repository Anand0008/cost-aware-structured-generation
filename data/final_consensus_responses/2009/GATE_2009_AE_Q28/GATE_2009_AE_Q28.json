      "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of the pitching moment coefficient with respect to the angle of attack (dCm/dα). A negative derivative (dCm/dα < 0) indicates static stability, meaning a restoring moment is generated that tends to bring the aircraft back to its original angle of attack after a disturbance. A positive derivative indicates instability.\n\nThe given pitching moment coefficient contribution from the horizontal tail is: Cmtail = 0.2 – 0.0215α.\n\nTo determine its stability contribution, we differentiate Cmtail with respect to α:\nd(Cmtail)/dα = d/dα (0.2 - 0.0215α)\nd(Cmtail)/dα = -0.0215\n\nSince d(Cmtail)/dα = -0.0215, which is a negative value, the contribution of the horizontal tail to the aircraft's longitudinal stability is stabilizing. The constant term (0.2) affects the pitching moment at zero angle of attack (Cm0) but does not influence the stability derivative."

        "Recall the fundamental criterion for longitudinal static stability. An aircraft or component is statically stable if the derivative of its pitching moment coefficient (Cm) with respect to the angle of attack (α) is negative, i.e., d(Cm)/dα < 0. This means an increase in angle of attack generates a nose-down (restoring) pitching moment.",
        "Recall the stability criterion. An aircraft (or component's contribution) is considered longitudinally statically stable if dC_m/d\\alpha < 0. This negative derivative indicates that an increase in \\alpha produces a nose-down (restoring) moment, while a decrease in \\alpha produces a nose-up (restoring) moment.",
        "Identify the given equation. The problem provides the pitching moment coefficient contribution from the horizontal tail as Cmtail = 0.2 – 0.0215 \\alpha.",

        "Perform the differentiation. dC_m_tail/d\\alpha = d/d\\alpha (0.2 - 0.0215 \\alpha) = -0.0215.",

      "Control Systems": "A negative d(Cm)/dα provides inherent open-loop stability, reducing the gain required from the flight control system (elevator) to maintain desired pitch attitude.",
      "Physics - Rotational Dynamics": "The condition d(Cm)/dα < 0 is analogous to a stable equilibrium in rotational motion, where a restoring torque opposes angular displacement."
