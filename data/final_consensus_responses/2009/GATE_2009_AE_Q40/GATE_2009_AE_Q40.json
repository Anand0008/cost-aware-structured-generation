      "reasoning": "The problem describes a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system consisting of two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, connected by a single spring with stiffness $k$. Both masses are on a frictionless horizontal surface, indicating free vibration. To find the natural frequencies, we must derive the equations of motion and solve the characteristic equation.\n\n1.  **Define coordinates:** Let $x_1$ be the displacement of mass $m_1$ to the right from its equilibrium position, and $x_2$ be the displacement of mass $m_2$ to the right from its equilibrium position.\n\n2.  **Equations of Motion (EOM) using Newton's Second Law:**\n    *   For mass $m_1$: The spring exerts a force $k(x_2 - x_1)$ on $m_1$ (to the right if $x_2 > x_1$, to the left if $x_1 > x_2$).\n        $m_1 \\ddot{x_1} = k(x_2 - x_1)$\n        $m_1 \\ddot{x_1} + k x_1 - k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 1)\n\n    *   For mass $m_2$: The spring exerts a force $k(x_1 - x_2)$ on $m_2$ (to the right if $x_1 > x_2$, to the left if $x_2 > x_1$).\n        $m_2 \\ddot{x_2} = k(x_1 - x_2)$\n        $m_2 \\ddot{x_2} - k x_1 + k x_2 = 0$ (Equation 2)\n\n3.  **Assume harmonic motion:** For free vibration, assume solutions of the form:\n    $x_1(t) = X_1 e^{i\\omega t}$\n    $x_2(t) = X_2 e^{i\\omega t}$\n    where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are amplitudes and $\\omega$ is the natural frequency.\n    Then, $\\ddot{x_1} = -\\omega^2 X_1 e^{i\\omega t}$ and $\\ddot{x_2} = -\\omega^2 X_2 e^{i\\omega t}$.\n\n4.  **Substitute into EOMs:**\n    $-m_1 \\omega^2 X_1 + k X_1 - k X_2 = 0 \\implies (k - m_1 \\omega^2) X_1 - k X_2 = 0$ (Equation 3)\n    $-m_2 \\omega^2 X_2 - k X_1 + k X_2 = 0 \\implies -k X_1 + (k - m_2 \\omega^2) X_2 = 0$ (Equation 4)\n\n5.  **Matrix form:** These equations can be written in matrix form:\n    $\\begin{bmatrix} (k - m_1 \\omega^2) & -k \\ -k & (k - m_2 \\omega^2) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\end{Bmatrix} = \\begin{Bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\end{Bmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Characteristic Equation:** For a non-trivial solution (i.e., $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.\n    $\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix} (k - m_1 \\omega^2) & -k \\ -k & (k - m_2 \\omega^2) \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\n    $(k - m_1 \\omega^2)(k - m_2 \\omega^2) - (-k)(-k) = 0$\n    $k^2 - k m_2 \\omega^2 - k m_1 \\omega^2 + m_1 m_2 \\omega^4 - k^2 = 0$\n    $m_1 m_2 \\omega^4 - k(m_1 + m_2) \\omega^2 = 0$\n\n7.  **Solve for $\\omega^2$:** Factor out $\\omega^2$:\n    $\\omega^2 [m_1 m_2 \\omega^2 - k(m_1 + m_2)] = 0$\n\n    This yields two possible solutions for $\\omega^2$:\n    *   **First natural frequency:** $\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies \\omega_1 = 0$\n        This represents the rigid body mode, where the entire system (both masses and the spring) translates together without any relative motion between $m_1$ and $m_2$. The spring remains at its equilibrium length, exerting no force.\n\n    *   **Second natural frequency:** $m_1 m_2 \\omega^2 - k(m_1 + m_2) = 0$\n        $m_1 m_2 \\omega^2 = k(m_1 + m_2)$\n        $\\omega_2^2 = \\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}$\n        $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}}$\n        This represents the oscillatory mode, where the masses vibrate relative to each other.\n\nTherefore, the natural frequencies are $0$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{k(m_1+m_2)}{m_1 m_2}}$, which matches Option A."

        "Step 1: Identify the system as a 2-DOF free-free spring-mass system. Define displacements $x_1$ and $x_2$ for masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ from their equilibrium positions.",
        "Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law to each mass to derive the equations of motion, considering the spring force $k(x_2 - x_1)$ between them.",
        "Step 3: Assume harmonic motion $x_i(t) = X_i e^{i\\omega t}$, substitute into the equations of motion, and set the determinant of the resulting coefficient matrix to zero to form the characteristic equation.",
        "Rewrite the equations of motion in matrix form, $[M] \\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} + [K] \\mathbf{x} = 0$. Assuming harmonic motion $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{X} e^{i\\omega t}$, this transforms into the eigenvalue problem $([K] - \\omega^2[M]) \\mathbf{X} = 0$. Specifically, for this system: $\\begin{bmatrix} k - \\omega^2 m_1 & -k \\\\ -k & k - \\omega^2 m_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{Bmatrix} = 0$.",
        "For non-trivial solutions (i.e., $\\mathbf{X} \\neq 0$), the determinant of the coefficient matrix $([K] - \\omega^2[M])$ must be zero. Set the determinant to zero to form the characteristic equation: $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} k - \\omega^2 m_1 & -k \\\\ -k & k - \\omega^2 m_2 \\end{bmatrix} = 0$, which expands to $(k - \\omega^2 m_1)(k - \\omega^2 m_2) - k^2 = 0$.",
        "Expand and simplify the characteristic equation to solve for $\\omega^2$: $k^2 - k\\omega^2 m_1 - k\\omega^2 m_2 + \\omega^4 m_1 m_2 - k^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $-k\\omega^2 (m_1 + m_2) + \\omega^4 m_1 m_2 = 0$.",
        "Factor out $\\omega^2$ from the simplified equation: $\\omega^2 [ -k(m_1 + m_2) + \\omega^2 m_1 m_2 ] = 0$. This yields two solutions for $\\omega^2$: $\\omega^2 = 0$ and $\\omega^2 = \\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}$.",
        "Take the square root of the $\\omega^2$ values to find the natural frequencies. The natural frequencies are therefore $\\omega_1 = 0$ (representing a rigid body translation mode) and $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 m_2}}$ (representing the elastic vibrational mode)."
