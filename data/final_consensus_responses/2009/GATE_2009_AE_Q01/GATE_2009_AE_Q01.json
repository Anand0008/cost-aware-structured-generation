This is because the expansion occurs through an infinite series of infinitesimally weak Mach waves, each of which is an isentropic process. Consequently, the Mach number increases, while static pressure, static temperature, and static density all decrease. The total (stagnation) pressure and temperature also remain constant. This is a fundamental property of isentropic, supersonic flow expansions."

Due to its isentropic nature, entropy (s), total (stagnation) pressure (P₀), and total (stagnation) temperature (T₀) remain constant across the expansion fan. However, static properties change: Mach number (M) increases, while static pressure (p), static temperature (T), and static density (ρ) all decrease.",
