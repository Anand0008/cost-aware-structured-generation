The general iterative formula is given by x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{F(x_n)}{F'(x_n)}.\n\nTo find the square root of a positive real number R, we need to define a function F(x) such that its root is \\sqrt{R}. If x = \\sqrt{R}, then x^2 = R. Rearranging this, we get x^2 - R = 0.\nSo, we define our function as F(x) = x^2 - R.\n\nNext, we find the first derivative of F(x) with respect to x:\nF'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - R) = 2x.\n\nNow, substitute F(x) and F'(x) into the Newton-Raphson iterative formula:\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2 - R}{2x_n}\n\nSimplify the expression:\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2}{2x_n} + \\frac{R}{2x_n}\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{2} + \\frac{R}{2x_n}\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{2x_n - x_n}{2} + \\frac{R}{2x_n}\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n}{2} + \\frac{R}{2x_n}\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{R}{x_n} \\right)\n\nThis derived iterative scheme matches option B."

        "description": "The bisection method is a bracketing numerical technique for finding roots of a function. It works by repeatedly halving an interval known to contain a root, requiring two initial guesses ($x_a$, $x_b$) such that $F(x_a)$ and $F(x_b)$ have opposite signs, and then selecting the subinterval where the sign change occurs.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Guaranteed convergence (if continuous function and initial bracket), conceptually simple, does not require derivative computation. Cons: Slower convergence (linear) compared to Newton-Raphson, requires an initial bracketing interval, less efficient.",

        "name": "Secant Method",
        "description": "The secant method is a variation of the Newton-Raphson method that approximates the derivative using a finite difference (a secant line connecting two previous approximations, $x_{n-1}$ and $x_n$) instead of an analytical derivative. The iterative formula is $x_{n+1} = x_n - F(x_n) \\frac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{F(x_n) - F(x_{n-1})}$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Faster convergence (superlinear) than bisection, does not require an analytical derivative, fewer computations per iteration than Newton-Raphson. Cons: Slower convergence and less robust than Newton-Raphson, requires two initial guesses, can diverge if initial guesses are poor or for functions with rapidly changing derivatives.",
