It functions as a pressure transducer, measuring the ambient static air pressure, which predictably decreases with increasing altitude. The instrument contains sealed aneroid capsules that expand or contract with changes in external static pressure. This mechanical movement is then transmitted to a display, indicating the corresponding altitude. Therefore, its primary function is to sense pressure and convert it into an altitude reading."
