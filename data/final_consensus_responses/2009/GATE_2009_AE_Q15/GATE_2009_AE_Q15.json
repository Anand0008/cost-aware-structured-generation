      "reasoning": "The thrust available from a turbojet engine decreases as altitude increases. This is primarily due to the decrease in atmospheric air density ($\\rho$) at higher altitudes. The mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) through the engine is directly proportional to air density ($\\dot{m}_a = \\rho A_{inlet} V_{\\infty}$). A reduction in air density leads to a lower mass flow rate of air ingested by the engine. Since thrust is fundamentally generated by the change in momentum of this air (as shown in the thrust equation $F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0) + A_e (p_e - p_0)$), a decrease in mass flow rate directly results in a decrease in the thrust produced. This principle is consistent with standard aerospace engineering knowledge."

        "Connect the mass flow rate to the thrust produced. The thrust (F) generated by a turbojet engine is approximately proportional to the mass flow rate of air and the difference between the exhaust velocity and the inlet velocity (F \\approx \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty}))."
