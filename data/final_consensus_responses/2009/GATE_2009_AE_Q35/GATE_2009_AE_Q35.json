      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the lift coefficient of a finite wing based on the characteristics of its airfoil section. The key steps involve:\n1. Recognizing that a symmetric airfoil has a zero-lift angle of attack of 0 degrees.\n2. Calculating the 2D lift curve slope ($a_0$) of the airfoil from the given lift coefficient and angle of attack.\n3. Using the formula for the lift curve slope of an untwisted elliptic finite wing to convert the 2D slope ($a_0$) to the 3D wing slope ($a$).\n4. Calculating the finite wing lift coefficient ($C_L$) using the 3D wing slope and the given angle of attack.\n\nStep 1: Convert angle of attack to radians.\n$\\alpha = 5^{\\circ} = 5 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\text{ radians} = \\frac{\\pi}{36} \\text{ radians} \\approx 0.087266 \\text{ radians}$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the 2D airfoil lift curve slope ($a_0$).\nFor a symmetric airfoil, the lift coefficient ($c_l$) is directly proportional to the angle of attack ($\\alpha$) from the zero-lift line, which is the chord line itself. Thus, $c_l = a_0 \\alpha$. \nGiven $c_l = 0.53$ at $\\alpha = 5^{\\circ}$.\n$a_0 = \\frac{c_l}{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.53}{\\pi/36} = \\frac{0.53 \\times 36}{\\pi} \\approx \\frac{19.08}{3.14159} \\approx 6.073 \\text{ per radian}$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the finite wing lift curve slope ($a$).\nFor an untwisted wing of elliptical planform (Oswald efficiency factor $e=1$), the finite wing lift curve slope is given by:\n$a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + a_0 / (\\pi AR)}$\nGiven $AR = 6$.\n$a = \\frac{6.073}{1 + 6.073 / (\\pi \\times 6)} = \\frac{6.073}{1 + 6.073 / 18.8495} = \\frac{6.073}{1 + 0.3222} = \\frac{6.073}{1.3222} \\approx 4.593 \\text{ per radian}$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the finite wing lift coefficient ($C_L$).\nFor an untwisted symmetric wing, the zero-lift angle of attack is still 0 degrees. Therefore, the lift coefficient for the wing at $5^{\\circ}$ angle of attack is:\n$C_L = a \\alpha = 4.593 \\times (\\pi/36) \\approx 4.593 \\times 0.087266 \\approx 0.4008$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, $0.4008$ is closest to $0.40$ (Option C)."

        "Step 2: Recall the key principle that the lift curve slope of a finite elliptical wing ($a$) is less than that of its 2D airfoil section ($a_0$) due to 3D effects. The relationship is $a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + a_0/(\\pi AR)}$, where $a$ and $a_0$ are in consistent angular units (typically per radian).",
        "Step 3: Convert the given angle of attack from degrees to radians: $\\alpha_{\\text{radians}} = 5^{\\circ} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\approx 0.087266 \\text{ radians}$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the 2D lift curve slope ($a_0$) of the symmetric airfoil. Since a symmetric airfoil has zero lift at zero angle of attack, $a_0 = \\frac{c_l}{\\alpha_{\\text{radians}}} = \\frac{0.53}{0.087266} \\approx 6.074 \\text{ per radian}$.",
        "Step 5: Apply the finite wing lift curve slope formula to calculate the 3D wing lift curve slope ($a$) and then the finite wing lift coefficient ($C_L$).\n$a = \\frac{6.074}{1 + 6.074/(\\pi \\times 6)} \\approx 4.593 \\text{ per radian}$.\n$C_L = a \\times \\alpha_{\\text{radians}} = 4.593 \\times 0.087266 \\approx 0.4007 \\approx 0.40$.",
        "Calculate the finite wing lift coefficient. Using the proportionality of lift coefficient to lift-curve slope, \\(C_L = (a/a_0) \\times c_{l,2D} = 0.75 \\times 0.53 = 0.3975 \\approx 0.40\\).",
