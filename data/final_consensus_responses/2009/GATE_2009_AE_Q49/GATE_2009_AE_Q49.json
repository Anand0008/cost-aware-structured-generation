The rank of the coefficient matrix $A$ (the left $2 \\times 2$ part, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$) is 1, as there is one non-zero row.\n    So, $rank(A) = 1$.\n2.  The rank of the augmented matrix $[A|b]$ (the entire $2 \\times 3$ matrix, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -3 \\end{bmatrix}$) is 2, as there are two non-zero rows.\n    So, $rank([A|b]) = 2$.\n3.  The number of unknowns, $n$, is 2.\n\nAccording to the Rouché-Capelli theorem (or rank test for linear systems):\n*   If $rank(A) = rank([A|b]) = n$, there is a unique solution.\n*   If $rank(A) = rank([A|b]) < n$, there are infinitely many solutions.\n*   If $rank(A) < rank([A|b])$, there is no solution (the system is inconsistent).\n\nIn this case, $rank(A) = 1$ and $rank([A|b]) = 2$. Since $rank(A) < rank([A|b])$, the system is inconsistent and has no solution. Therefore, option A is correct."
