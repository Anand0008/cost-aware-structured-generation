      "reasoning": "The specific thrust for an ideal ramjet with optimally expanded exhaust (where exhaust static pressure equals ambient static pressure) is given by $F_s = V_e - V_0$. For an ideal ramjet with isentropic intake and nozzle, and constant specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), the nozzle exit Mach number ($M_e$ or $M_9$) equals the flight Mach number ($M_0$).\n\nGiven:\n$V_0 = 1 \\text{ km/s} = 1000 \\text{ m/s}$\n$T_0 = 225 \\text{ K}$\n$T_e = 900 \\text{ K}$ (exhaust static temperature)\n\nWe know $V = M a$ and $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$.\nSo, $V_0 = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$ and $V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.\nSince $M_e = M_0$, we have $V_e = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.\nSubstitute these into the specific thrust formula:\n$F_s = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} - M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0} = M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R} (\\sqrt{T_e} - \\sqrt{T_0})$.\nFrom the expression for $V_0$, we can write $M_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma R} = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$.\nSubstituting this back into the $F_s$ equation:\n$F_s = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} (\\sqrt{T_e} - \\sqrt{T_0})$.\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n$\\sqrt{T_0} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ K}^{1/2}$\n$\\sqrt{T_e} = \\sqrt{900} = 30 \\text{ K}^{1/2}$\n$F_s = \\frac{1000 \\text{ m/s}}{15 \\text{ K}^{1/2}} (30 \\text{ K}^{1/2} - 15 \\text{ K}^{1/2})$\n$F_s = \\frac{1000}{15} \\times 15 = 1000 \\text{ N-s/kg}$.\n\nThis result is consistent with the simplified ideal ramjet specific thrust expression $F_s = V_0 (\\sqrt{\\tau_b} - 1)$, where $\\tau_b = T_{t4}/T_{t2}$. For an ideal ramjet with optimal expansion and constant $\\gamma$, $T_{t4}/T_{t2} = T_e/T_0$. Thus, $F_s = V_0 (\\sqrt{T_e/T_0} - 1) = V_0 (\\frac{\\sqrt{T_e}}{\\sqrt{T_0}} - 1) = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} (\\sqrt{T_e} - \\sqrt{T_0})$, which is the same formula derived above."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify given data and assumptions. Flight velocity $V_0 = 1000$ m/s, ambient temperature $T_0 = 225$ K, ambient pressure $P_0 = 0.25$ bar, exit static temperature $T_e = 900$ K, specific heat ratio $\\gamma = 1.4$ (assumed for air), gas constant $R = 287$ J/(kg·K) (standard for air). The nozzle is optimally expanded, so $P_e = P_a$. The ramjet is ideal: isentropic intake and nozzle, constant total pressure combustion.",
        "Step 2: Compute flight Mach number. First, calculate the ambient speed of sound $a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 225} \\approx 300.67$ m/s. Then, determine the flight Mach number $M_0 = V_0 / a_0 = 1000 / 300.67 \\approx 3.325$.",
        "Step 3: Compute total conditions after isentropic intake. The total temperature $T_{t0} = T_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2\\right) = 225 \\times (1 + 0.2 \\times 3.325^2) \\approx 722.7$ K. For an ideal intake, $T_{t2} = T_{t0}$ and $P_{t2} = P_{t0}$. The total pressure $P_{t0} = P_0 \\left( T_{t0}/T_0 \\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)} \\approx 25000 \\times (722.7/225)^{3.5} \\approx 1.485 \\times 10^6$ Pa.",
        "Step 4: Determine combustor exit total temperature $T_{t4}$. For an ideal ramjet, combustor exit total pressure $P_{t4} = P_{t2} = P_{t0}$. Since the nozzle is optimally expanded, the exit static pressure $P_e = P_0 = 0.25 \\text{ bar} = 25000$ Pa. The pressure ratio across the nozzle is $P_{t4}/P_e = P_{t0}/P_0 \\approx 1.485 \\times 10^6 / 25000 \\approx 59.4$. Using the isentropic relation $T_{t4}/T_e = (P_{t4}/P_e)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} = (59.4)^{0.2857} \\approx 3.212$. Thus, $T_{t4} = T_e \\times 3.212 = 900 \\times 3.212 \\approx 2890.8$ K.",
        "Step 5: Compute exit velocity $V_e$. The exit Mach number $M_e$ is found from the isentropic total temperature relation: $T_e = T_{t4} / \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2\\right)$, which gives $M_e^2 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma-1} \\left( \\frac{T_{t4}}{T_e} - 1 \\right) = 5 \\times (2890.8/900 - 1) \\approx 5 \\times (3.212 - 1) \\approx 11.06$, so $M_e \\approx 3.325$. The exit speed of sound $a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 900} \\approx 601.35$ m/s. Therefore, the exit velocity $V_e = M_e \\times a_e = 3.325 \\times 601.35 \\approx 2000$ m/s.",
        "Step 6: Compute specific thrust. For an ideal ramjet with an optimally expanded nozzle, the specific thrust is given by the difference between the exit and inlet velocities: $F/\\dot{m} = V_e - V_0 = 2000 - 1000 = 1000$ m/s. This is equivalent to 1000 N-s/kg.",
