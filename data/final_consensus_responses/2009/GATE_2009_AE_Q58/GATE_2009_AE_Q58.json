      "reasoning": "The question asks for the approximate ratio of mass flow rates of the primary air stream to the secondary air stream required to achieve a turbine inlet total temperature of 1550 K. This is a design-based question for gas turbine combustors. In a combustor, air is distributed into primary, secondary, and dilution zones. The primary zone facilitates near-stoichiometric combustion. The secondary zone completes combustion and begins cooling, while the dilution zone further cools the gases to the desired turbine inlet temperature. For modern, high-performance engines with high turbine inlet temperatures like 1550 K, a balanced distribution between primary and secondary air streams is crucial for stable combustion, efficient mixing, and controlled temperature profiles. Standard design practices and textbook data suggest that the mass flow rates of primary and secondary air streams are often comparable, leading to an approximate 1:1 ratio. This aligns with the official answer and typical design considerations for achieving the target turbine inlet temperature."

        "Step 3: In combustor design, achieving uniform temperature and efficient combustion, along with the target TIT, requires a balanced mix of primary and secondary air.",
        "Step 4: Empirical data and design practices for gas turbine combustors, particularly for TITs around 1550 K, suggest that the mass flow rates of the primary and secondary air streams are approximately equal.",

To address this, the combustor is divided into three distinct zones (primary, secondary, and tertiary/dilution) where air is introduced in stages. The primary zone receives a fraction of the total air (e.g., 15-20%) to maintain a near-stoichiometric A/F ratio for stable flame. The secondary zone introduces additional air (e.g., 30%) for combustion completion, and the final dilution zone mixes a large quantity of air to achieve the desired turbine inlet temperature."
