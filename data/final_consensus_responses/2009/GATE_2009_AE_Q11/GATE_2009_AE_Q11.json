        "First, recall the definitions for each propellant classification: Cryogenic propellants require extremely low temperatures for storage (e.g., LOX, LH2). Semi-cryogenic propellants consist of one cryogenic and one non-cryogenic component (e.g., LOX-RP1). Earth-storable propellants can be stored at ambient temperatures (e.g., N2O4, UDMH). Compressed gases are stored under high pressure in their gaseous state (e.g., N2).",
        "Analyze N2O4-UDMH: Both N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide) and UDMH (Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine) are liquids at room temperature and can be stored for long periods without refrigeration. Therefore, classify N2O4-UDMH as Earth-Storable (ES).",
        "Analyze LOX-RP1: LOX (liquid oxygen) is cryogenic, requiring extremely low temperatures. RP-1 (kerosene) is liquid at room temperature and is earth-storable. Since one component is cryogenic and the other is not, classify LOX-RP1 as Semi-Cryogenic (SC).",
        "Analyze LOX-LH2: Both LOX (liquid oxygen) and LH2 (liquid hydrogen) are cryogenic, requiring extremely low temperatures (e.g., LH2 boiling point ~20 K, LOX boiling point ~90 K). Therefore, classify LOX-LH2 as Cryogenic (C).",
        "Analyze N2: Nitrogen gas (N2), when used as a propellant or pressurant, is typically stored as a gas under high pressure at ambient temperatures. Therefore, classify N2 as Compressed Gas (CG).",
        "Match classifications to options: Compare the derived classifications (N2O4-UDMH: ES, LOX-RP1: SC, LOX-LH2: C, N2: CG) with the given options to find the matching choice. This combination corresponds to option C."
