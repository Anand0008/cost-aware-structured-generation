      "reasoning": "The thin airfoil theory predicts that the lift slope, dCl/dα, is equal to 2π per radian for any airfoil shape, whether symmetric or cambered. This is a universal result of the theory, which assumes inviscid, incompressible flow over a thin airfoil at small angles of attack. While camber shifts the entire lift curve (introducing a non-zero lift at zero angle of attack), it does not change the slope of the linear portion of the lift curve. The lift slope is independent of the specific airfoil geometry as long as these assumptions hold. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Any airfoil shape'."

        "Recognize that while camber affects the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$), it does not alter the slope of the lift curve. This is because the lift curve slope, $\\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha}$, is independent of the specific airfoil geometry (symmetric or cambered) under the theory's assumptions.",
        "Differentiating the lift coefficient $C_l$ with respect to the angle of attack $\\alpha$ yields the universal lift curve slope: $\\frac{dC_l}{d\\alpha} = 2\\pi$.",
