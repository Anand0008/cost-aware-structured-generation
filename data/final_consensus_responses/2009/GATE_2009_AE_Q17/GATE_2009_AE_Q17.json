      "reasoning": "The life of a geostationary communications satellite is primarily limited by the quantity of on-board fuel available for station-keeping maneuvers. Geostationary satellites are subject to various orbital perturbations, including gravitational forces from the Moon and Sun, solar radiation pressure, and the Earth's non-spherical gravitational field (J2 effect). To maintain their precise position within their designated geostationary slot, satellites must perform regular corrective maneuvers (station-keeping) by firing on-board thrusters, which consume this finite propellant. Once the fuel is depleted, the satellite can no longer maintain its position and its operational life ends. Atmospheric drag is negligible at geostationary altitudes (~35,786 km), making orbital decay due to drag a non-primary factor. While the working life of electronic circuitry and the risk of meteorite impacts are considerations, they are generally secondary to fuel depletion for station-keeping in determining the primary operational limit."

        "Step 2: Identify the various forces and perturbations acting on a satellite in geostationary orbit, which continuously try to pull it out of its assigned slot.",
        "Step 3: Detail the key perturbations for GEO satellites, including gravitational tugs from the Moon and Sun, solar radiation pressure, and the Earth's non-uniform gravitational field (J2 effect).",
        "Step 4: Recognize the necessity of 'station-keeping'. To counteract these continuous perturbations and maintain its precise geostationary slot, the satellite must periodically fire its on-board thrusters.",
        "Step 5: Link station-keeping to fuel consumption. These thruster firings require and consume on-board propellant, which is a finite and non-replenishable resource.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate other potential limiting factors: Electronic circuitry is designed for long life. Atmospheric drag is negligible at geostationary altitude. Meteorite impacts are a risk but less frequent and predictable as a primary life-limiting factor compared to fuel.",
        "Step 7: Conclude that the finite quantity of on-board fuel for station-keeping is the primary, predictable, and mission-limiting consumable for a geostationary communications satellite.",
        "Step 8: Without sufficient fuel to perform these station-keeping maneuvers, the satellite will eventually drift out of its assigned orbital slot, rendering it uncontrollable and ending its operational life."
