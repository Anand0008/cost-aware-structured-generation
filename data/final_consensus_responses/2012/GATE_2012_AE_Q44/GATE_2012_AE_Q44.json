The stress components are derived from the Airy stress function using the following relations:\n\n1.  Normal stress in x-direction: $\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}$\n2.  Normal stress in y-direction: $\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}$\n3.  Shear stress: $\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}$\n\nLet's calculate the derivatives for the given $\\phi$:\n\n*   First partial derivative with respect to y: $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = \\beta x + 2\\gamma y$\n*   Second partial derivative with respect to y: $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 2\\gamma$\n    So, $\\sigma_x = 2\\gamma$\n\n*   First partial derivative with respect to x: $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = 2\\alpha x + \\beta y$\n*   Second partial derivative with respect to x: $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = 2\\alpha$\n    So, $\\sigma_y = 2\\alpha$\n\n*   Mixed second partial derivative: $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\beta x + 2\\gamma y) = \\beta$\n    So, $\\tau_{xy} = -\\beta$\n\nThe problem states that the panel is subjected to uniform tensile stress, $\\sigma_o$, on all four edges. This implies:\n\n*   $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_o$ (tensile stress in x-direction)\n*   $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_o$ (tensile stress in y-direction)\n*   $\\tau_{xy} = 0$ (no shear stress for pure uniform tensile loading)\n\nEquating the derived stress components with the boundary conditions:\n\n*   From $\\sigma_x = 2\\gamma$, we have $2\\gamma = \\sigma_o \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{\\sigma_o}{2}$\n*   From $\\sigma_y = 2\\alpha$, we have $2\\alpha = \\sigma_o \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma_o}{2}$\n*   From $\\tau_{xy} = -\\beta$, we have $-\\beta = 0 \\implies \\beta = 0$\n\nTherefore, the coefficients are $\\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma_o}{2}$, $\\beta = 0$, and $\\gamma = \\frac{\\sigma_o}{2}$.
