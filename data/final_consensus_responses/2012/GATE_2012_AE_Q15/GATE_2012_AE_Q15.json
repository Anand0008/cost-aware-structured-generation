      "reasoning": "The rate of climb (R/C) for an aircraft in steady, unaccelerated flight is directly proportional to the excess thrust (Thrust Available, $T_A$ minus Thrust Required, $T_R$ or Drag, $D$) and the flight velocity ($V$), and inversely proportional to its weight ($W$). The fundamental formula is given by $R/C = \\frac{V(T_A - D)}{W}$.\n\nLet's denote the initial conditions with subscript 1 and the new conditions with subscript 2.\nInitial Rate of Climb: $R/C_1 = \\frac{V_1(T_{A1} - D_1)}{W_1}$\n\nThe problem states that the aircraft experiences a 10% drop in thrust, so $T_{A2} = 0.9 \\times T_{A1}$.\nIt also states that a 'new equilibrium is reached at the same speed', which implies $V_2 = V_1$. Since the speed is the same, and assuming the altitude is also effectively the same (or changes negligibly for drag calculation, especially for small climb angles), the drag $D$ will remain approximately constant, so $D_2 \\approx D_1 = D$. The weight $W$ also remains constant, $W_2 = W_1 = W$.\n\nNew Rate of Climb: $R/C_2 = \\frac{V(T_{A2} - D)}{W} = \\frac{V(0.9 T_{A1} - D)}{W}$\n\nTo compare the new rate of climb with the old, we take the ratio:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{\\frac{V(0.9 T_{A1} - D)}{W}}{\\frac{V(T_{A1} - D)}{W}} = \\frac{0.9 T_{A1} - D}{T_{A1} - D}$\n\nLet $X = T_{A1} - D$. Since the aircraft is in a steady climb, $T_{A1}$ must be greater than $D$, so $X > 0$. Also, $D > 0$.\nWe can rewrite $T_{A1} = X + D$.\n\nSubstitute this into the ratio:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{0.9(X + D) - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X + 0.9D - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X - 0.1D}{X}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = 0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$\n\nSince $D > 0$ and $X > 0$, the term $\\frac{0.1D}{X}$ is a positive value. Therefore, $\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} < 0.9$.\n\nThis means that the new rate of climb ($R/C_2$) is less than 90% of the original rate of climb ($R/C_1$). A drop of exactly 10% would mean $R/C_2 = 0.9 \\times R/C_1$. Since $R/C_2$ is even smaller than $0.9 \\times R/C_1$, the new rate of climb is lower by *more than* 10%.\n\nCrucially, the excess thrust $(T_A - D)$ is typically a small fraction of the total thrust $T_A$. A 10% reduction in total thrust $T_A$ therefore leads to a much larger percentage reduction in the excess thrust $(T_A - D)$, and consequently, a much larger percentage reduction in the rate of climb."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the fundamental principle of Rate of Climb (R/C). For an aircraft in steady, unaccelerated climb at speed V, the rate of climb is given by $ROC = V \\sin\\gamma = \\dfrac{(T - D)V}{W} = \\dfrac{P_{excess}}{W}$, where $P_{excess} = (T - D)V$ is the excess power, $T$ is thrust available, $D$ is drag (thrust required), and $W$ is aircraft weight.",
        "The governing equation for Rate of Climb (R/C) is $R/C = \\frac{V(T - D)}{W}$, where $T$ is thrust available, $D$ is drag, $V$ is flight velocity, and $W$ is aircraft weight.",
        "Define the initial conditions. Let the initial thrust be $T_1$, initial drag $D_1$, initial speed $V_1$, and initial weight $W_1$. The initial rate of climb is $R/C_1 = \\frac{V_1(T_1 - D_1)}{W_1}$. It's important to note that in a typical climb, the excess thrust $(T - D)$ is usually much smaller than the total thrust $T$.",
        "Define the new conditions after the perturbation. The thrust drops by 10%, so $T_2 = 0.9 T_1$. The problem states 'at the same speed', so $V_2 = V_1$. Assuming the aircraft maintains the same speed and altitude, the drag $D$ remains constant ($D_2 = D_1 = D$). The aircraft's weight $W$ also remains constant ($W_2 = W_1 = W$). A 10% reduction in total thrust $T$ removes a quantity of thrust that is significant compared to the initial excess thrust $(T_1 - D_1)$, which will lead to a large percentage drop in the excess thrust.",
        "Formulate the equation for the new R/C. Using the new conditions, the new rate of climb is $R/C_2 = \\frac{V(0.9 T_1 - D)}{W}$.",
        "Compare the new R/C to the initial R/C by taking their ratio: $\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{V(0.9 T_1 - D)/W}{V(T_1 - D)/W} = \\frac{0.9 T_1 - D}{T_1 - D}$.",
        "Analyze the ratio algebraically. Let $X = T_1 - D$. Since the aircraft is climbing, $T_1 > D$, so $X$ is a positive value (representing the initial excess thrust). The ratio can be rewritten as: $\\frac{R/C_2}{R/C_1} = \\frac{0.9 T_1 - D}{T_1 - D} = \\frac{0.9(X + D) - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X + 0.9D - D}{X} = \\frac{0.9X - 0.1D}{X} = 0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$.",
        "Conclude based on the analysis. Since drag $D > 0$ and initial excess thrust $X = (T_1 - D) > 0$, the term $\\frac{0.1D}{X}$ is positive. Therefore, $0.9 - \\frac{0.1D}{X}$ must be less than $0.9$. This implies $R/C_2 < 0.9 \\times R/C_1$, meaning the new rate of climb is lower by more than 10%."

For instance, during a go-around or takeoff, a partial thrust loss means the rate of climb decreases by a proportionally larger amount, which is critical for obstacle clearance and safe operations.",

Underestimating the impact of thrust loss can lead to safety hazards, increased fuel consumption, and compromise regulatory compliance for minimum climb gradients."

A quick numerical example can confirm the non-linear effect.",
