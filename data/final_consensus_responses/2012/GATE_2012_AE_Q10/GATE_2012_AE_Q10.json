      "reasoning": "The Poisson's ratio (ν) for stable, isotropic, linear elastic materials theoretically lies between -1 and 0.5. For most common engineering materials, especially metals like those used in aircraft (e.g., aluminum and titanium alloys), ν is positive and typically falls within the range of 0.25 to 0.35. A value of ν = 0.5 indicates an incompressible material, which is not typical for aircraft alloys. Negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic materials) are rare and not commonly used in aircraft structures. Therefore, option C (0.2 ≤ ν ≤ 0.4) is the most accurate representation for typical aircraft grade metallic alloys, as it encompasses the common practical range and aligns with standard engineering knowledge."

        "Understand the question, which asks for the typical range of Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$) for 'aircraft grade metallic alloys'. This requires knowledge of standard material properties for structural aerospace metals and the definition of Poisson's ratio as the ratio of transverse strain to axial strain under uniaxial stress.",
        "Recall the theoretical limits of Poisson's ratio for stable, isotropic, linear elastic materials, which are derived from the requirement that elastic moduli must be positive: $-1 < \\nu < 0.5$.",
        "Identify the practical range for common engineering materials, specifically metallic alloys used in structural applications like aircraft. Most metals exhibit a positive Poisson's ratio, typically between 0.25 and 0.35. Note that auxetic materials ($\\nu < 0$) are rare, and a value of 0.5 indicates incompressibility, which is not typical for aircraft alloys.",
        "Apply this knowledge to 'aircraft grade metallic alloys'. Primary structural materials in aircraft, such as aluminum and titanium alloys, are standard metallic alloys, and their Poisson's ratio falls within the typical metal range. A Poisson's ratio of $\\nu = 0.5$ indicates an incompressible material, which is not typical for aircraft alloys.",
        "Evaluate the given options against the established theoretical and practical ranges. Option A ($-1 \\le \\nu \\le 0$) includes auxetic materials, not typical metallic alloys. Option B ($0 \\le \\nu \\le 0.2$) is generally too low for most metals. Option D ($0.4 \\le \\nu \\le 0.5$) is at the higher end, representing materials closer to incompressible, which is not typical for the majority of metals. Option C ($0.2 \\le \\nu \\le 0.4$) best fits the typical range of 0.25 to 0.35 for aircraft grade metallic alloys, making it the correct answer."
