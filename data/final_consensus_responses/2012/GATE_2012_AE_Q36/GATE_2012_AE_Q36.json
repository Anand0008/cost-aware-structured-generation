      "reasoning": "The problem involves an aircraft flying 'without re-trimming', which means the control surface (elevator) position is fixed to the initial trim setting. Any deviation from the trim speed will result in a pitching moment imbalance, which must be counteracted by a control force (stick force). For a statically stable aircraft, this stick force is proportional to the difference in dynamic pressure from the trim condition.\n\n1.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure at the initial trim condition (SSL, 100 m/s TAS):**\n    Given: $\\rho_{SL} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $V_{trim} = 100 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_{trim} = 0.5 \\rho_{SL} V_{trim}^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (100)^2 = 6100 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure for the first scenario (SSL, 90 m/s TAS):**\n    Given: $V_1 = 90 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_1 = 0.5 \\rho_{SL} V_1^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (90)^2 = 4941 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the constant of proportionality (C) for the stick force:**\n    A 'pull of 5 N' is required to hold the speed at 90 m/s. For a statically stable aircraft, reducing speed from trim typically requires a pull (nose-up moment) to counteract the natural nose-down tendency. Let's define the stick force $F_s = C (q - q_{trim})$, where a positive $F_s$ is a push (nose-down) and a negative $F_s$ is a pull (nose-up).\n    So, $F_s = -5 \\text{ N}$ (for a pull).\n    $-5 \\text{ N} = C (q_1 - q_{trim}) = C (4941 - 6100) = C (-1159)$\n    $C = \\frac{-5}{-1159} = \\frac{5}{1159} \\approx 0.004314 \\text{ m}^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure for the second scenario (3000 m altitude, 120 m/s TAS):**\n    Given: $\\rho_{alt} = 0.91 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $V_2 = 120 \\text{ m/s}$\n    $q_2 = 0.5 \\rho_{alt} V_2^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.91 \\times (120)^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.91 \\times 14400 = 6552 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the required control force for the second scenario:**\n    $F_s = C (q_2 - q_{trim}) = 0.004314 \\times (6552 - 6100)$\n    $F_s = 0.004314 \\times (452) \\approx 1.950 \\text{ N}$\n\n6.  **Interpret the sign of the force:**\n    Since $F_s$ is positive ($+1.95 \\text{ N}$), it implies a 'push' (downward force) according to our convention.\n    Therefore, the aircraft needs a 1.95 N downward force."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the concept of 'without re-trimming'. This implies that the elevator position is fixed to the initial trim setting. For a statically stable aircraft, the stick force ($F_s$) required to maintain a speed different from the trim speed ($V_{trim}$) is proportional to the difference in dynamic pressure ($q$) from the trim dynamic pressure ($q_{trim}$). We define $F_s = C(q - q_{trim})$, where a positive $F_s$ indicates a push (nose-down moment) and a negative $F_s$ indicates a pull (nose-up moment).",
        "Step 2: Calculate the dynamic pressure at the initial trim condition. Given true airspeed (TAS) of $100 \\text{ m/s}$ at standard sea level (SSL) with air density $\\rho_{SL} = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. Use the dynamic pressure formula $q = 0.5 \\rho V^2$. $q_{trim} = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (100)^2 = 6100 \\text{ N/m}^2$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the dynamic pressure for the first off-trim condition and determine the proportionality constant. Given $V_1 = 90 \\text{ m/s}$ at SSL, $q_1 = 0.5 \\times 1.22 \\times (90)^2 = 4941 \\text{ N/m}^2$. A 'pull of 5 N' means $F_s = -5 \\text{ N}$. Using $F_s = C(q_1 - q_{trim})$, we get $-5 = C (4941 - 6100)$, so $C = \\frac{-5}{-1159} \\approx 0.004314 \\text{ m}^2$.",
        "Step 4: Establish proportionality constant. Using the SSL data point: (\\rho V^2)/(\\rho_0 V_0^2) = (1.22 * 90^2)/(1.22 * 100^2)=0.81, so 1 - 0.81 = 0.19. Thus, 5 N = k * 0.19, giving k = 5/0.19 \\approx 26.3158 N.",
        "Step 5: Apply to altitude condition. At 3000 m: \\rho = 0.91 kg/m^3, V=120 m/s. Compute (\\rho V^2)/(\\rho_0 V_0^2) = (0.91*120^2)/(1.22*100^2)=13104/12200 \\approx 1.07475. Then 1 - 1.07475 = -0.07475.",
        "Step 6: Calculate required force: F = k * (-0.07475) \\approx 26.3158 * (-0.07475) \\approx -1.967 N. The negative sign indicates a force opposite to pull, i.e., a push (downward force). Magnitude rounds to 1.95 N.",
        "Step 7: Select the corresponding option: 1.95 N downward force (option B).",
        "Step 8: Conclude the solution by stating the final answer and its interpretation: The required control force is 1.95 N downward, which corresponds to a push."
