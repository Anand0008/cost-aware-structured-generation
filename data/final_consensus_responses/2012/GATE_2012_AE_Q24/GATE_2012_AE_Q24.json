      "reasoning": "In a semi-monocoque aircraft wing, the skin and spar webs are primary carriers of shear stresses. The wing skin, especially as part of the closed section (torque box) with stringers and spars, efficiently resists torsional (twisting) moments by developing shear stresses, and also carries shear stresses due to vertical shear forces. Spar webs are specifically designed to resist vertical shear forces and, as components of the torque box, significantly contribute to resisting torsional moments. Aerodynamic forces generate both vertical shear forces (from lift) and torsional moments (from pitching/rolling moments). Therefore, the skin and spar webs collectively carry shear stresses arising from both direct aerodynamic forces and aerodynamic moment components. Options that restrict their role to only forces or only moments, or incorrectly assign primary normal stress carrying to webs, are incorrect."
