      "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. This question addresses the 'starting difficulty' in a supersonic wind tunnel, which involves establishing stable supersonic flow in the test section by 'swallowing' the starting normal shock. The key principles are:\n\n1.  **Stagnation Pressure Loss across a Normal Shock:** A normal shock wave causes a significant loss in stagnation pressure. This means the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock (P₀,diffuser) is lower than the stagnation pressure upstream (P₀,nozzle).\n2.  **Choked Mass Flow Rate:** The maximum mass flow rate through a choked throat is proportional to the stagnation pressure upstream of that throat and its area (ṁ_choked ∝ P₀ A_throat / √T₀).\n3.  **Mass Flow Matching for Startup:** For the tunnel to start and the shock to be 'swallowed', the mass flow rate that the nozzle throat can pass must be equal to or less than what the diffuser throat can 'swallow'. Since P₀,diffuser < P₀,nozzle due to the shock, to maintain the same mass flow rate (assuming constant stagnation temperature), the diffuser throat area (A_throat,diffuser) must be larger than the nozzle throat area (A_throat,nozzle). Specifically, A_throat,diffuser = A_throat,nozzle × (P₀,nozzle / P₀,diffuser). Since (P₀,nozzle / P₀,diffuser) > 1, it implies A_throat,diffuser > A_throat,nozzle.\n4.  **Shock Location for 'Swallowing':** The term 'swallow the starting shock' implies that the shock, which initially forms in the divergent section of the nozzle or test section, must be pushed downstream through the diffuser throat. Once it has passed through the diffuser throat and stable supersonic flow is established in the test section, the shock will reside downstream of the diffuser throat, typically in the divergent section of the diffuser or further downstream, where the flow decelerates subsonically.\n\nTherefore, the diffuser throat must be larger than the nozzle throat, and for stable operation, the shock must be located downstream of the diffuser throat. This corresponds to option B."

        "Step 1: Understand the 'starting difficulty' in supersonic wind tunnels. This refers to the challenge of establishing stable supersonic flow in the test section due to the formation of a normal shock wave during the startup phase, and the role of the C-D diffuser in overcoming this by 'swallowing' the shock.",
        "Recognize that the starting difficulty in such a tunnel arises due to the formation of a normal shock wave in the diffuser during startup, which causes a significant loss in stagnation pressure ($P_0$).",
        "Relate the stagnation pressure loss to the mass flow capacity of the diffuser throat. The maximum mass flow rate through a choked throat is directly proportional to the stagnation pressure upstream of that throat. Since the diffuser throat is downstream of the shock, the stagnation pressure available to drive flow through it ($P_{0,diffuser}$) is lower than the stagnation pressure upstream of the nozzle throat ($P_{0,nozzle}$). This reduces the effective pressure available to drive flow through the diffuser throat.",
        "Determine the required relative size of the diffuser throat. The stagnation pressure loss creates a mismatch between the maximum mass flow rate the nozzle throat can pass and what the diffuser throat (with the shock upstream) can 'swallow'. To maintain the same mass flow rate through both throats, the diffuser throat area ($A_{throat,diffuser}$) must be larger than the nozzle throat area ($A_{throat,nozzle}$) to compensate for the reduced stagnation pressure ($P_{0,diffuser} < P_{0,nozzle}$). This ensures the diffuser can 'swallow' the mass flow supplied by the nozzle.",
        "Determine the desired location of the shock for 'swallowing'. For the tunnel to be considered 'started' and the shock 'swallowed', the shock must have successfully passed through the diffuser throat. Its stable position will be downstream of the diffuser throat, typically in the divergent section of the diffuser or further towards the exhaust, where the flow becomes subsonic. The shock is not held at the throat in steady operation.",
        "Based on these points, the diffuser throat must be larger than the nozzle throat, and the shock must be located downstream of the diffuser throat for the tunnel to start successfully. Having the shock at the diffuser throat would still lead to starting difficulty."

        "industry_example": "Large supersonic wind tunnels, such as those at NASA facilities (e.g., NASA Langley’s Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel or the Boeing Transonic Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames), often employ variable geometry diffusers (movable walls or plugs) to adjust the diffuser throat area. This allows the tunnel to 'swallow' the starting shock and then optimize for stable, steady-state supersonic flow in the test section.",
        "why_it_matters": "Accurate simulation of high-speed aerodynamic phenomena is essential for developing advanced aerospace systems. Efficient and reliable operation of supersonic wind tunnels is critical for testing new aircraft and spacecraft designs. Incorrect diffuser design can lead to an 'unstarted' tunnel, causing large pressure oscillations, test interruptions, and making it unusable for its intended purpose."

This larger area allows the normal shock to be 'swallowed' into the diffuser. Once stable supersonic flow is established, the throat area can be reduced to its optimal size for efficient operation.",

Place the normal shock in the diverging part of the diffuser where Mach number is still supersonic but decreasing, ensuring the test section remains supersonic and the diffuser can handle the shock.",
