The product of the eigenvalues is equal to the determinant of the matrix.\n\nGiven matrix: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & 10 \\\\ 5 & 2 & 25 \\\\ 1 & 6 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$\nOne eigenvalue is given as $\\lambda_1 = -9.33$.\nLet the other two eigenvalues be $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Trace of the Matrix**\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements.\n$\\text{Trace}(A) = 2 + 2 + 5 = 9$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Sum of Eigenvalues Property**\n$\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = \\text{Trace}(A)$\n$-9.33 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 9$\n$\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 9 + 9.33 = 18.33$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Determinant of the Matrix**\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}$ is given by $a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$.\n$\\text{det}(A) = 2((2)(5) - (25)(6)) - 7((5)(5) - (25)(1)) + 10((5)(6) - (2)(1))$\n$\\text{det}(A) = 2(10 - 150) - 7(25 - 25) + 10(30 - 2)$\n$\\text{det}(A) = 2(-140) - 7(0) + 10(28)$\n$\\text{det}(A) = -280 - 0 + 280 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Product of Eigenvalues Property**\n$\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = \\text{det}(A)$\nSince $\\text{det}(A) = 0$, it implies that at least one of the eigenvalues must be zero. Given that $\\lambda_1 = -9.33 \\neq 0$, one of the remaining eigenvalues, say $\\lambda_3$, must be $0$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Remaining Eigenvalue**\nSubstitute $\\lambda_3 = 0$ into the sum equation from Step 2:\n$\\lambda_2 + 0 = 18.33$\n$\\lambda_2 = 18.33$\n\nThus, the three eigenvalues of the matrix A are approximately $-9.33$, $18.33$, and $0$. More precisely, the eigenvalues are $0$, $\\frac{9+3\\sqrt{85}}{2} \\approx 18.33$, and $\\frac{9-3\\sqrt{85}}{2} \\approx -9.33$. The question asks for 'One of the other eigenvalues'.

      "Fluid Mechanics": "Eigenvalue analysis is used in stability analysis of fluid flows, such as boundary layer stability or hydrodynamic stability.",
      "Linear Algebra": "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra, with applications in many areas of engineering and science.",
      "Structural Mechanics": "Eigenvalue analysis is crucial for understanding the natural frequencies and mode shapes of structural systems, which is essential for vibration analysis and design.",
      "Structures": "In structural dynamics, eigenvalues correspond to the natural frequencies of vibration of a structure, and eigenvectors represent the corresponding mode shapes. This is vital for resonance analysis and structural design."
