      "reasoning": "The sentence 'Food prices ___ again this month' requires a verb that indicates an increase in prices. We need to choose between 'raise' and 'rise' and apply the correct tense.\n\n1.  **'Raise' vs. 'Rise'**: \n    *   'Raise' is a transitive verb, meaning it requires a direct object. Someone or something 'raises' something else (e.g., 'The government raised taxes', 'He raised his hand'). Prices do not 'raise' themselves.\n    *   'Rise' is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. Something 'rises' on its own (e.g., 'The sun rises', 'The water level rose'). Food prices 'rise' naturally due to market forces.\n    Therefore, 'rise' is the correct verb to use in this context.\n\n2.  **Tense**: The phrase 'again this month' suggests an action that started in the past and is continuing or has continued up to the present. The present perfect continuous tense ('have been rising') is appropriate for such an ongoing action.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. have raised**: Incorrect. 'Raise' is transitive, and prices don't raise themselves. Also, 'have raised' would imply a completed action by an agent.\n*   **B. have been raising**: Incorrect. 'Raise' is transitive, and this is the active voice, implying prices are actively raising something.\n*   **C. have been rising**: Correct. 'Rise' is intransitive, and the present perfect continuous tense correctly conveys an ongoing increase in food prices up to the present moment, fitting 'again this month'.\n*   **D. have arose**: Incorrect. 'Arose' is the simple past tense of 'arise'. The past participle is 'arisen'. So, 'have arisen' would be the correct present perfect form of 'arise'. While 'arise' can mean to come into being or occur, 'rise' (meaning to go up) is the more natural and common verb for price increases. The grammatical error 'have arose' makes this option definitively wrong."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Analyze the sentence context. The sentence \"Food prices ___ again this month\" describes an ongoing trend of increasing prices that has been happening and continues into the current month.",
        "Step 2: Identify the core grammatical distinction. The primary challenge is choosing between 'raise' and 'rise', and then selecting the correct tense.",
        "Step 3: Understand 'raise' vs. 'rise'. 'Raise' is a transitive verb, meaning it requires a direct object (e.g., \"The government raised taxes\"). 'Rise' is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object; the subject itself performs the action (e.g., \"The sun rises\"). Since food prices are increasing on their own, an intransitive verb is needed.",
        "Step 4: Determine the appropriate verb tense. The phrase \"again this month\" indicates an action that began in the past and is continuing or has continued up to the present. The present perfect continuous tense (have/has been + -ing form of the verb) is suitable for describing such an ongoing action.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate the options based on verb type and tense. A. 'have raised': Incorrect, as 'raise' is transitive. B. 'have been raising': Incorrect, as 'raise' is transitive. C. 'have been rising': Correct, as 'rise' is intransitive and 'have been rising' is the appropriate present perfect continuous tense for an ongoing action. D. 'have arose': Incorrect past participle of 'arise' (should be 'arisen'). Also, 'arise' is generally used for problems or situations, not typically for price increases in this context.",
        "Step 6: Select the best option. Based on the analysis of verb transitivity and appropriate tense for an ongoing action, option C, \"have been rising,\" is the correct choice."
