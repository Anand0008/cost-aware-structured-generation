For an incompressible, irrotational 2D source flow, the radial velocity component ($V_r$) is inversely proportional to the radial distance ($r$) from the source, given by the formula $V_r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}$.\n\nGiven:\n1.  Pipe radius $r_1 = 10 \\text{ mm} / 2 = 5 \\text{ mm} = 0.005 \\text{ m}$.\n2.  Radial velocity at pipe surface $V_{r1} = 1 \\text{ m/s}$.\n3.  Target radial location $r_2 = 0.5 \\text{ m}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the source strength $\\Lambda$ using the initial conditions:\n$\\Lambda = 2\\pi r_1 V_{r1} = 2\\pi (0.005 \\text{ m}) (1 \\text{ m/s}) = 0.01\\pi \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nNext, find the radial velocity $V_{r2}$ at $r_2 = 0.5 \\text{ m}$:\n$V_{r2} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r_2} = \\frac{0.01\\pi \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}}{2\\pi (0.5 \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.01}{1} \\text{ m/s} = 0.01 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nThe information about the pipe spinning at 60 rpm is a distractor for the calculation of the *radial* velocity component, as radial and tangential velocities are orthogonal and the radial flow field is independent of the source's tangential motion in this ideal model."
