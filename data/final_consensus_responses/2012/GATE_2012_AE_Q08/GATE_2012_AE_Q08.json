For an Earth-Mars transfer, the transfer ellipse must be tangential to both the initial (Earth's) and final (Mars') circular orbits. The perigee (closest point to the central body, the Sun) of the transfer ellipse must coincide with Earth's orbital radius, and the apogee (farthest point from the Sun) must coincide with Mars' orbital radius. This configuration minimizes the required velocity changes for the transfer."

        "Step 2: Identify the central body and the initial/final orbits for an Earth-Mars transfer. The central body is the Sun. Earth is in an inner, smaller circular orbit, and Mars is in an outer, larger circular orbit.",
        "Step 3: Recall the definitions of perigee (periapsis) and apogee (apoapsis). Perigee is the point in an orbit where the spacecraft is closest to the central body, and apogee is the point where it is farthest from the central body.",
        "Step 4: For a Hohmann transfer from an inner to an outer orbit, the transfer ellipse must be tangential to the initial inner orbit at its perigee and tangential to the final outer orbit at its apogee.",
        "Step 5: Applying this to an Earth-Mars transfer, the perigee of the Hohmann transfer ellipse will be at Earth's orbit (the inner orbit), and the apogee will be at Mars' orbit (the outer orbit).",
        "Step 6: Therefore, the correct description is 'apogee at Mars and perigee at Earth'."
