      "reasoning": "For a symmetric airfoil, the lift coefficient at zero angle of attack (α = 0°) is zero. This is because the upper and lower surfaces of a symmetric airfoil are mirror images of each other. When the airfoil's chord line is aligned parallel to the incoming free stream velocity, the flow over the upper and lower surfaces is perfectly symmetrical. This symmetry results in identical pressure distributions above and below the airfoil, leading to no net vertical force. Consequently, the net lift force is zero, and the lift coefficient C_L is also zero. This is a fundamental principle of aerodynamics."

        "Analyze flow symmetry. For a symmetric airfoil at zero angle of attack ($\\alpha = 0$), the airflow pattern over the upper surface is a mirror image of the airflow pattern under the lower surface, resulting in perfectly symmetrical flow.",
        "Relate flow symmetry to pressure distribution. This perfectly symmetrical flow leads to identical pressure distributions on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil.",
        "Conclude the lift force. Since there is no differential pressure between the top and bottom surfaces, there is no net vertical aerodynamic force, meaning the lift (L) generated by the airfoil is zero.",
        "Determine the lift coefficient. The lift coefficient ($\\text{C}_L$) is defined as $\\text{C}_L = \\frac{L}{0.5 \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}^2 S_{ref}}$. Since the lift (L) is zero at zero angle of attack for a symmetric airfoil, its lift coefficient ($\\text{C}_L$) must also be zero."
