      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the maximum amplitude of vibration of the first degree of freedom for an undamped two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) system. The general solution for the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}(t)$ of an undamped MDOF system is a superposition of its normal modes:\n$$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\sin(\\omega_i t) + B_i \\cos(\\omega_i t))$$\nGiven:\n1.  Mode shapes: $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix}$\n2.  Natural frequencies: $\\omega_1 = 0.45 \\text{ Hz}$, $\\omega_2 = 1.2471 \\text{ Hz}$\n3.  Initial displacement: $\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ mm}$\n4.  Initial velocity: $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Apply initial velocity condition:**\n    The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\omega_i \\cos(\\omega_i t) - B_i \\omega_i \\sin(\\omega_i t))$.\n    At $t=0$, $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i (A_i \\omega_i)$.\n    Since $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $\\mathbf{\\phi}_i$ are linearly independent, we must have $A_i \\omega_i = 0$. Since $\\omega_i \\neq 0$, it implies $A_i = 0$ for all modes.\n    Therefore, the general solution simplifies to:\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\mathbf{\\phi}_1 B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\mathbf{\\phi}_2 B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n2.  **Apply initial displacement condition:**\n    At $t=0$, $\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\mathbf{\\phi}_1 B_1 + \\mathbf{\\phi}_2 B_2$.\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} B_1 + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix} B_2$$\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $2 = 1 \\cdot B_1 + 1 \\cdot B_2 \\implies B_1 + B_2 = 2$\n    (2) $1 = 0.5 \\cdot B_1 - 0.675 \\cdot B_2$\n\n3.  **Solve for $B_1$ and $B_2$:**\n    From equation (1), $B_2 = 2 - B_1$.\n    Substitute $B_2$ into equation (2):\n    $1 = 0.5 B_1 - 0.675 (2 - B_1)$\n    $1 = 0.5 B_1 - 1.35 + 0.675 B_1$\n    $1 + 1.35 = (0.5 + 0.675) B_1$\n    $2.35 = 1.175 B_1$\n    $B_1 = \\frac{2.35}{1.175} = 2$\n    Now find $B_2$: $B_2 = 2 - B_1 = 2 - 2 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Write the complete response $\\mathbf{u}(t)$:**\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} (2) \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -0.675 \\end{bmatrix} (0) \\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n    $$\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cos(\\omega_1 t)$$\n\n5.  **Determine the maximum amplitude of the first degree of freedom:**\n    The displacement of the first degree of freedom is $u_1(t) = 2 \\cos(\\omega_1 t)$.\n    The maximum amplitude of $u_1(t)$ occurs when $\\cos(\\omega_1 t) = \\pm 1$.\n    Therefore, the maximum amplitude of the first degree of freedom is $2 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nThe calculation is consistent with the provided correct answer."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Recall that for an undamped 2-DOF system, the free vibration response is a superposition of normal modes: $\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i (C_i \\cos(\\omega_i t) + D_i \\sin(\\omega_i t))$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i$ are mode shapes, $\\omega_i$ are natural frequencies, and $C_i, D_i$ are constants.",
        "Step 2: Apply initial conditions: zero initial velocity $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = \\mathbf{0}$ implies $D_i = 0$ for all i. Thus, the response simplifies to $\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i C_i \\cos(\\omega_i t)$.",
        "Step 3: Use the initial displacement $\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\{2, 1\\}^T$ mm to find $C_i$: $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i C_i = \\mathbf{u}(0)$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the given mode shapes $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_1 = \\{1, 0.5\\}^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_2 = \\{1, -0.675\\}^T$ into the initial displacement equation: $C_1 \\{1, 0.5\\} + C_2 \\{1, -0.675\\} = \\{2, 1\\}$. This forms a system of linear equations: $C_1 + C_2 = 2$ and $0.5 C_1 - 0.675 C_2 = 1$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the linear equations. From the first equation, $C_1 = 2 - C_2$. Substitute this into the second equation: $0.5(2 - C_2) - 0.675 C_2 = 1 \\Rightarrow 1 - 0.5 C_2 - 0.675 C_2 = 1 \\Rightarrow 1 - 1.175 C_2 = 1 \\Rightarrow 1.175 C_2 = 0 \\Rightarrow C_2 = 0$. Substituting $C_2 = 0$ back into $C_1 = 2 - C_2$ gives $C_1 = 2$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the determined constants $C_1=2$ and $C_2=0$ back into the simplified response equation. The response for the first degree of freedom is $u_1(t) = 1 \\cdot C_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t) = 2 \\cos(2\\pi \\cdot 0.45 \\cdot t)$. The maximum amplitude of vibration for the first degree of freedom is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine term, which is $|2| = 2$ mm.",
