      "reasoning": "The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for static transverse deflection under a distributed load q(x) is given by the equation EI \\frac{d^4v}{dx^4} = q(x). Let's analyze its properties:\n1.  **Order:** The highest derivative is the fourth derivative (\\frac{d^4v}{dx^4}), making it a **4th order** differential equation.\n2.  **Type:** The deflection v is a function of only one independent variable, x (position along the beam), for static problems. Therefore, it is an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**, not a partial differential equation (PDE).\n3.  **Linerity:** The dependent variable v and its derivatives appear only to the first power, and there are no products of v or its derivatives. Thus, it is a **linear** differential equation.\n4.  **Homogeneity:** The right-hand side of the equation is q(x), which represents the uniformly distributed load. Since the question specifies an 'uniformly distributed load', q(x) is a non-zero constant. An equation is homogenous if its right-hand side is zero. Since q(x) \\neq 0, the equation is **non-homogenous**.\n\nCombining these characteristics, the governing equation is a 4th order linear non-homogenous ordinary differential equation. This matches option B."

        "Step 1: Understand the problem context. The question concerns the static transverse deflection of a beam under a uniformly distributed load, governed by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. This implies that the deflection `v` is a function of position `x` only, not time.",
        "Step 2: Recall the fundamental relationships from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and beam mechanics:\n    *   Bending moment (M) is related to curvature: M = EI (d^2v/dx^2).\n    *   Shear force (V) is related to bending moment: V = dM/dx.\n    *   Distributed load (q) is related to shear force: q = -dV/dx (or dV/dx + q = 0).",
        "Step 3: Derive the governing differential equation. Substitute the relationships:\n    *   q = -d/dx (V) = -d/dx (dM/dx) = -d^2M/dx^2.\n    *   Substitute M = EI (d^2v/dx^2): q = -d^2/dx^2 (EI d^2v/dx^2).\n    *   Assuming constant flexural rigidity EI, this simplifies to: EI (d^4v/dx^4) = q(x).",
        "Step 4: Classify the derived equation EI (d^4v/dx^4) = q(x):\n    *   **Order**: The highest derivative present is the fourth derivative (d^4v/dx^4), so it is a **4th order** equation.\n    *   **Type**: Since `v` is a function of only one independent variable `x` (position) in static analysis, it is an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**.",
        "Step 5: Continue classifying the equation:\n    *   **Linearity**: The dependent variable `v` and its derivatives appear only to the first power, and `EI` and `q(x)` are not functions of `v` or its derivatives, making it a **linear** equation.\n    *   **Homogeneity**: The right-hand side `q(x)` represents the distributed load. Since a load is present (`q(x) ≠ 0`), the equation is **non-homogenous**.",
        "Step 6: Combine these characteristics to match the correct option: The governing equation for static transverse deflection of a beam under a uniformly distributed load, based on Euler-Bernoulli theory, is a **4th order, linear, non-homogenous, ordinary differential equation**.",
