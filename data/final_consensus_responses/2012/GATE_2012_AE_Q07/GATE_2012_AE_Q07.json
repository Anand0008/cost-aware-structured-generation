      "reasoning": "The shadowgraph flow visualization technique is fundamentally sensitive to the second spatial derivative of the refractive index, which, through the Gladstone-Dale relation, is directly proportional to the second spatial derivative of density. This means it highlights regions where the density gradient is changing rapidly, such as shock waves. The intensity variations observed in a shadowgraph are proportional to the Laplacian of density, or the second spatial derivatives of density. All provided RAG chunks consistently confirm this principle. Option A describes interferometry, option B describes schlieren, and option D is not a standard sensitivity for common optical techniques."

        "The shadowgraph flow visualization technique relies on the principle that the refractive index of a gas is proportional to its density, as described by the Gladstone-Dale law (n - 1 = K \\rho). This means density variations in a flow field cause changes in the refractive index.",
        "As light rays pass through a flow field with density variations, they are deflected due to these changes in refractive index. Different optical techniques (shadowgraph, schlieren, interferometry) are sensitive to different aspects of this light ray distortion.",
        "For the shadowgraph technique, light rays passing through the density field are projected onto a screen. The intensity variations on this screen result from the convergence or divergence of these rays. This convergence/divergence is related to the rate of change of light ray deflection, which corresponds to the second spatial derivative of the refractive index (d^2n/dy^2). In contrast, schlieren systems measure the first derivative of refractive index, and interferometers measure the integrated refractive index.",
        "Due to the Gladstone-Dale relation, the second spatial derivative of the refractive index is directly proportional to the second spatial derivative of density. The intensity variation on a shadowgraph screen (\\Delta I / I_0) is approximately proportional to the Laplacian of density, i.e., the sum of the second partial derivatives of density with respect to spatial coordinates: \\Delta I / I_0 \\propto L Z K (\\partial^2 \\rho / \\partial x^2 + \\partial^2 \\rho / \\partial y^2).",
        "Therefore, the shadowgraph technique is fundamentally sensitive to the second spatial derivative of density (or the Laplacian of density) with respect to spatial coordinates.",
