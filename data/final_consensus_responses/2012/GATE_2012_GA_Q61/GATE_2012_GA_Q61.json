      "reasoning": "Let $P(B)$ be the probability that B hits the convict. Let $P(B) = x$. Given that the probability that A hits the convict is three times the probability that B hits, we have $P(A) = 3x$.\n\nThe event \"convict not getting injured\" means that both A and B miss. Since their shots are independent, the probability of this event is the product of their individual miss probabilities:\n$P(\\text{not injured}) = P(\\text{A misses}) \\times P(\\text{B misses})$\n\nUsing the complementary probability $P(E') = 1 - P(E)$:\n$P(\\text{A misses}) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 3x$\n$P(\\text{B misses}) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - x$\n\nGiven that $P(\\text{not injured}) = 0.5$, we set up the equation:\n$0.5 = (1 - 3x)(1 - x)$\n\nExpand the right side of the equation:\n$0.5 = 1 - x - 3x + 3x^2$\n$0.5 = 1 - 4x + 3x^2$\n\nRearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$):\n$3x^2 - 4x + 1 - 0.5 = 0$\n$3x^2 - 4x + 0.5 = 0$\n\nUse the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ to solve for $x$, with $a=3$, $b=-4$, and $c=0.5$:\n$x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(3)(0.5)}}{2(3)}$\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 6}}{6}$\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}{6}$\n\nCalculate the two possible values for $x$:\n$x_1 = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{10}}{6} \\approx \\frac{4 + 3.162277}{6} = \\frac{7.162277}{6} \\approx 1.1937$\n$x_2 = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{10}}{6} \\approx \\frac{4 - 3.162277}{6} = \\frac{0.837723}{6} \\approx 0.13962$\n\nSince probability values must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive), $x_1 \\approx 1.1937$ is not a valid probability. Therefore, the valid probability for B hitting the convict is $x_2 \\approx 0.13962$.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, $P(B) \\approx 0.14$. This matches option A."
