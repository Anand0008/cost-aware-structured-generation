The velocity is $\\dot{x}(t) = -X \\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t)$. The energy dissipated per cycle is given by $W_d = \\int_0^T F_d \\, dx = \\int_0^T c \\, \\dot{x}^2 \\, dt$. Substituting $\\dot{x}(t)$ and integrating over one period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_d$ yields $W_d = \\pi c \\omega_d X^2$. This standard formula is explicitly stated in multiple retrieved knowledge chunks and matches option A."

      "question_nature": "Derivation / Formula Recall",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the system and define the harmonic displacement and velocity. Given the displacement $x(t) = X \\cos(\\omega_d t)$, the velocity is obtained by differentiating with respect to time: $\\dot{x}(t) = -X\\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t)$.",
        "Step 2: Define the viscous damping force. The viscous damping force is $F_d = c \\dot{x}$. Substituting the velocity, we get $F_d(t) = c (-X\\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t))$.",
        "Step 3: The energy dissipated per cycle ($W_d$) is the work done by the damping force over one period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_d$. This is given by the integral $W_d = \\oint F_d \\, dx$. Using $dx = \\dot{x} dt$, this becomes $W_d = \\int_0^T F_d(t) \\dot{x}(t) \\, dt$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the expressions for $F_d(t)$ and $\\dot{x}(t)$ into the integral: $W_d = \\int_0^T c [\\dot{x}(t)]^2 \\, dt = \\int_0^T c (-X\\omega_d \\sin(\\omega_d t))^2 \\, dt = c X^2 \\omega_d^2 \\int_0^T \\sin^2(\\omega_d t) \\, dt$.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate the integral $\\int_0^T \\sin^2(\\omega_d t) \\, dt$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, the integral becomes $\\int_0^T \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\omega_d t)}{2} dt$. Over one full period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_d$, the integral of $\\cos(2\\omega_d t)$ is zero. Therefore, $\\int_0^T \\sin^2(\\omega_d t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2} [t]_0^T = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_d}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the result of the integral back into the equation for $W_d$: $W_d = c X^2 \\omega_d^2 (\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_d}) = \\pi c \\omega_d X^2$. This is the energy dissipated per cycle and matches option A.",
