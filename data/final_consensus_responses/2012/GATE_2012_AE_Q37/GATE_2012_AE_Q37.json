      "reasoning": "The question asks for 'The ratio of the Mach number downstream of the shock to its normal component'. This phrasing can be ambiguous, potentially meaning $M_2 / M_{2n}$ or $M_{2n} / M_2$. However, to align with the provided options and the correct answer (Option A), the intended ratio is the normal component of the downstream Mach number ($M_{2n}$) to the total downstream Mach number ($M_2$).\n\nFor an oblique shock wave, the downstream flow makes an angle of $(\\beta - \\theta)$ with the shock wave, where $\\beta$ is the shock wave angle and $\\theta$ is the flow deflection angle (wedge angle). The normal component of the downstream Mach number ($M_{2n}$) is the projection of the total downstream Mach number ($M_2$) onto the direction normal to the shock wave. This relationship is given by:\n$M_{2n} = M_2 \\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$\n\nRearranging this equation to find the ratio $M_{2n} / M_2$:\n$\\frac{M_{2n}}{M_2} = \\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$\n\nThis directly matches option A. If the question were strictly interpreted as $M_2 / M_{2n}$, the answer would be $1 / \\sin(\\beta - \\theta)$, which is not among the options. Therefore, the intended question is for the ratio of the normal component to the total Mach number."
