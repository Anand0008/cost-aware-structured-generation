This property means that when a matrix is multiplied by itself, the result is the original matrix.\n\n1.  **Identity Matrix ($I$):** The identity matrix, when multiplied by itself, always results in the identity matrix. Thus, $I \\times I = I$, which means $I^2 = I$. The identity matrix satisfies the constraint.\n\n2.  **Null Matrix ($0$):** The null matrix (or zero matrix) consists of all zero elements. When a null matrix is multiplied by itself, the result is always a null matrix. Thus, $0 \\times 0 = 0$, which means $0^2 = 0$. The null matrix satisfies the constraint.\n\nSince both the identity matrix and the null matrix satisfy the condition $A^2 = A$, option C, 'both the identity matrix and the null matrix', is the correct answer."
