Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation: L{m d^2x/dt^2 + kx} = L{u(t)} which simplifies to m L{d^2x/dt^2} + k L{x} = L{u(t)}.\n2. Use the standard Laplace transform properties:\n   - L{d^2x/dt^2} = s^2 X(s) - s x(0) - x_dot(0)\n   - L{x} = X(s)\n   - L{u(t)} = 1/s (for the unit step function)\n3. Assume zero initial conditions (x(0) = 0, x_dot(0) = 0) as they are not specified and are standard for finding the forced response in the Laplace domain.\n4. Substitute these into the transformed equation: m (s^2 X(s) - s * 0 - 0) + k X(s) = 1/s.\n5. Simplify to: m s^2 X(s) + k X(s) = 1/s.\n6. Factor out X(s): X(s) (m s^2 + k) = 1/s.\n7. Solve for X(s): X(s) = 1 / (s (m s^2 + k)).\nThis derived solution matches option A."

        "description": "This method involves solving the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the time domain. It typically involves finding the homogeneous solution (complementary function) by solving the characteristic equation (e.g., $x_h(t) = A\\cos(\\omega_n t) + B\\sin(\\omega_n t)$ for $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$) and a particular solution for the non-homogeneous part (forcing function, e.g., $x_p = 1/k$ for $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 1$). The total solution is the sum of these two parts, with constants determined by applying initial conditions.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides direct physical insight into the transient and steady-state response. Cons: More steps involved, especially if initial conditions are non-zero or forcing functions are complex. Laplace method is often more straightforward for zero initial conditions and directly gives the full solution in one step, whereas initial conditions are applied at the end in classical methods, which can be cumbersome.",
        "when_to_use": "When you need to explicitly understand the time-domain oscillations, when initial conditions are non-zero and important, or for simpler forcing functions where classical methods like undetermined coefficients are efficient."
