      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the internal pressure at yield for a thin-walled spherical vessel based on the Von Mises yield criterion. First, determine the stress state in the spherical vessel. For a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel under internal pressure 'P', the principal stresses in the wall are equal in all tangential directions (hoop and longitudinal stresses are the same). The third principal stress, normal to the surface, is considered zero for thin-walled approximations.\n\n1.  **Calculate the principal stresses:**\n    *   Inner radius `r = D/2 = 1 m / 2 = 0.5 m`. Wall thickness `t = 10 mm = 0.01 m`.\n    *   The hoop/longitudinal stress in a thin-walled spherical vessel is given by `$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2t}$`.\n    *   So, `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\frac{P \\times 0.5 \\text{ m}}{2 \\times 0.01 \\text{ m}} = 25P$`.\n    *   The third principal stress `$\\sigma_3 = 0$` (stress normal to the surface).\n\n2.  **Apply the Von Mises Yield Criterion:**\n    *   The Von Mises equivalent stress `$\\sigma_e$` is given by `$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2]}$`.\n    *   At yield, `$\\sigma_e = \\sigma_Y$` (yield strength).\n    *   Substitute the principal stresses into the Von Mises equation:\n        `$\\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(25P - 25P)^2 + (25P - 0)^2 + (0 - 25P)^2]}$`\n        `$\\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [0^2 + (25P)^2 + (-25P)^2]}$`\n        `$\\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [2 \\times (25P)^2]}$`\n        `$\\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{(25P)^2}$`\n        `$\\sigma_Y = 25P$`\n\n3.  **Solve for the yield pressure `p_Y`:**\n    *   Given `$\\sigma_Y = 500 \\text{ MPa}$`\n    *   `$500 \\text{ MPa} = 25 \\times p_Y$`\n    *   `$p_Y = \\frac{500 \\text{ MPa}}{25} = 20 \\text{ MPa}$`\n\nTherefore, the internal pressure at yield based on the Von Mises criterion is 20 MPa, which corresponds to option D."
