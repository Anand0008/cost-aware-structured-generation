      "reasoning": "The logarithmic decrement (δ) is given as 0.125. The exact relationship between the logarithmic decrement (δ) and the damping ratio (ζ) for a viscously damped single degree of freedom system is given by the formula: δ = (2πζ) / √(1 - ζ²). For small damping ratios (ζ << 1), the term √(1 - ζ²) can be approximated as 1, simplifying the formula to δ ≈ 2πζ. Using this approximation, we can find the damping ratio: ζ = δ / (2π). Substituting the given value: ζ = 0.125 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.125 / 6.28318 ≈ 0.01989. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: ζ% = 0.01989 * 100% ≈ 1.989%. This value is closest to 2.0%. Using the exact formula would yield a value extremely close to this, confirming the validity of the approximation for this problem. Therefore, the closest option is D."

        "Step 3: Recognize that for small damping ratios (typically \\zeta < 0.2), the term \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} is very close to 1. This allows for a common and accurate approximation: \\delta \\approx 2 \\pi \\zeta. Given \\delta = 0.125 is small, this approximation is appropriate, simplifying to \\zeta \\approx \\frac{\\delta}{2 \\pi}.",

For higher accuracy, or to verify, the exact formula for \\zeta from \\delta is \\zeta = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{(2\\pi)^2 + \\delta^2}}. Substituting \\delta = 0.125 gives \\zeta = \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{(2\\pi)^2 + (0.125)^2}} \\approx \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{39.4784 + 0.015625}} \\approx \\frac{0.125}{6.2844} \\approx 0.01989.
