      "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is defined as the freestream Mach number at which the local Mach number at some point on the airfoil surface (typically the point of minimum pressure) first reaches unity (Mach 1.0). This is the point where supersonic flow first appears on the airfoil, marking the transition to the transonic flight regime. This definition is consistently provided across multiple retrieved knowledge chunks. Option A and B are incorrect because $M_{cr}$ is generally a subsonic freestream Mach number, not sonic or supersonic. Option D is incorrect because at $M_{cr}$, only a *local* point reaches Mach 1.0, not the entire airfoil surface; a region of supersonic flow forms only when the freestream Mach number *exceeds* $M_{cr}$."
