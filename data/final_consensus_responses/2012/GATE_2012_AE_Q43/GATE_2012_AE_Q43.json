Therefore, gravity losses during the burn phase are negligible, and the ideal rocket equation can be used to find the initial velocity. After this instantaneous burn, the payload coasts vertically upwards under constant gravity.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial-to-final mass ratio.**\nGiven propellant mass fraction ($m_p/m_0$) = 0.60.\nThe final mass ($m_f$) is the initial mass ($m_0$) minus the propellant mass ($m_p$).\n$m_f/m_0 = 1 - m_p/m_0 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\nTherefore, the initial-to-final mass ratio is $m_0/m_f = 1/0.40 = 2.5$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$).**\nUsing the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for instantaneous burn:\n$\\Delta V = c \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_0}{m_f}\\right)$\nGiven effective exhaust velocity ($c$) = 3000 m/s.\n$\\Delta V = 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot \\ln(2.5)$\n$\\Delta V \\approx 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.91629 \\approx 2748.87 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maximum altitude attained ($h$).**\nAfter achieving this velocity, the rocket coasts upwards. The maximum altitude is reached when its vertical velocity becomes zero. Using the kinematic equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ (where $v=0$, $u=\\Delta V$, $a=-g$):\n$0^2 = (\\Delta V)^2 + 2(-g)h$\n$h = \\frac{(\\Delta V)^2}{2g}$\nGiven $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n$h = \\frac{(2748.87 \\text{ m/s})^2}{2 \\cdot 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}$\n$h \\approx \\frac{7556300}{19.62} \\text{ m} \\approx 385132 \\text{ m} \\approx 385.13 \\text{ km}$.\nThis value is closest to 385 km, which corresponds to option D."

        "Step 1: Interpret the given data and assumptions. The propellant mass fraction is 60%, effective exhaust velocity is 3000 m/s, and gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/s^2. The 'instantaneous' burn implies an impulsive velocity change with no gravity loss during thrust. Calculate the initial-to-final mass ratio: Propellant mass fraction $m_p/m_0 = 0.60$. Final mass fraction $m_f/m_0 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$. Thus, mass ratio $m_0/m_f = 1/0.40 = 2.5$.",
        "Step 2: Since the propellant is expended instantaneously (burn time $t_b \\approx 0$), gravity loss during thrust can be ignored. Apply the ideal Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to find the velocity increment (initial upward velocity) imparted to the payload: $\\Delta v = c \\ln(m_0/m_f)$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the values into the ideal rocket equation: $\\Delta v = 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\ln(2.5)$. Calculate $\\ln(2.5) \\approx 0.91629$. Therefore, $\\Delta v \\approx 3000 \\times 0.91629 \\approx 2748.87 \\text{ m/s}$. This is the initial upward velocity ($v_0$) for the subsequent ballistic motion.",
        "Step 4: After the instantaneous burn, the rocket payload coasts vertically upward under constant gravitational acceleration $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$. To find the maximum altitude ($h_{\\text{max}}$) reached, use the kinematic equation for vertical motion where the final velocity at maximum height is zero: $h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the calculated initial velocity ($v_0 = 2748.87 \\text{ m/s}$) and gravitational acceleration ($g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$) into the maximum altitude formula: $h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(2748.87)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} \\approx \\frac{7,556,296}{19.62} \\approx 385,132 \\text{ m}$.",

If 'instantaneous' burn is mentioned, assume ideal \\Delta V (Tsiolkovsky) and then use kinematics for altitude. The calculation flow is: compute mass ratio \\rightarrow apply Tsiolkovsky equation for \\Delta v \\rightarrow use $h = v_0^2/(2g)$ for altitude. It's straightforward if formulas are known.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If stuck, estimate the \\Delta V (e.g., $\\ln(2.5) \\approx 0.92$, so $\\Delta v \\approx 2760$ m/s). Then quickly estimate altitude using $h = (\\Delta V)^2/(2g)$ (e.g., $h \\approx (2760^2)/(20) \\approx 3.8e5 m = 380 km$) and pick the closest option. Higher mass fraction and high exhaust velocity generally lead to altitudes of several hundred kilometers.",
      "time_management": "Allocate 2-3 minutes. The calculations are straightforward if formulas are known. It's a 2-mark question with negative marking, so efficient calculation is key."
