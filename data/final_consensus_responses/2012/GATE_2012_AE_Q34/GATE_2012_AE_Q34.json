      "reasoning": "The aircraft range is governed by the Breguet Range Equation. For a given aircraft, in steady, level flight, the range ($R$) can be expressed as:\n$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_0}{W_f}\\right)$\nwhere $K$ is a constant, $W_0$ is the initial aircraft weight (empty weight + fuel weight), and $W_f$ is the final aircraft weight (empty weight). To analyze the effect of fuel reduction, it's often convenient to express the range in terms of the fuel mass fraction, $f_m = \\frac{W_{fuel}}{W_0} = \\frac{W_0 - W_f}{W_0}$. From this, we can write $\\frac{W_0}{W_f} = \\frac{1}{1 - f_m}$. Substituting this into the Breguet Range Equation gives:\n$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - f_m}\\right) = -K \\ln(1 - f_m)$\n\nTo understand how a change in $f_m$ affects $R$, we examine the second derivative of $R(f_m)$. The function $R(f_m)$ is a **convex function** for $0 < f_m < 1$. A property of convex functions is that for a given percentage decrease in the input variable, the output variable decreases by a *larger* percentage. Therefore, a 10% reduction in the fuel mass fraction ($f_m$) will result in a decrease in range $R$ that is **more than 10%**.\n\nFor example, if $f_{m,std} = 0.5$ and $K=1$, then $R_{std} = -\\ln(1 - 0.5) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$. If fuel is reduced by 10%, $f_{m,new} = 0.9 \\times 0.5 = 0.45$. Then $R_{new} = -\\ln(1 - 0.45) = \\ln(1/0.55) \\approx 0.592$. The percentage decrease in range is $\\frac{0.693 - 0.592}{0.693} \\times 100\\% \\approx 14.57\\%$, which is greater than 10%."

        "Introduce the fuel mass fraction, $f_m = \\frac{W_0 - W_f}{W_0}$. This can be rearranged to express the weight ratio as $\\frac{W_0}{W_f} = \\frac{1}{1-f_m}$.",

        "Since $K > 0$ and $(1-x)^2 > 0$ for $0 < x < 1$, $g''(x) > 0$. This means the function $R(f_m)$ is convex.",
