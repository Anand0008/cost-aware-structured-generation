      "reasoning": "The ideal static pressure coefficient for a diffuser ($C_{p,s}$) is defined as the ratio of the static pressure rise ($p_2 - p_1$) to the inlet dynamic pressure ($\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_1 V_1^2$). That is, $C_{p,s} = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_1 V_1^2}$.\nFor an ideal diffuser, assuming incompressible flow (a standard assumption when Mach number is not specified for such problems), Bernoulli's equation states that the total pressure is conserved: $p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$. From this, the static pressure rise can be expressed as $p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $C_{p,s}$: $C_{p,s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^2$.\nFor incompressible flow, the continuity equation is $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$. Therefore, the velocity ratio is $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$.\nThe given area ratio is $A_2/A_1 = 2.0$. So, $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{1}{2.0} = 0.5$.\nSubstituting this velocity ratio into the $C_{p,s}$ formula: $C_{p,s} = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\nAlthough the official GATE answer key for this question is 'Marks to All', which suggests potential ambiguity or a flaw in the question, the derivation for 0.75 is straightforward and based on standard ideal incompressible flow assumptions for diffusers."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define the ideal static pressure coefficient ($C_{p,s}$). For a diffuser, it is defined as the ratio of the static pressure rise across the diffuser to the dynamic pressure at the inlet: $C_{p,s} = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2}$.",
        "Step 2: Apply Bernoulli's equation for ideal incompressible flow. For steady, incompressible, inviscid flow along a streamline, Bernoulli's equation states: $p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$.",
        "Step 3: Rearrange Bernoulli's equation. Express the static pressure rise ($p_2 - p_1$): $p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (V_1^2 - V_2^2)$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the continuity equation. For steady, incompressible flow, the continuity equation is $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$.",
        "Step 5: Determine the velocity ratio from the area ratio. The problem states the area ratio is $A_2/A_1 = 2.0$. From the continuity equation, $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{1}{2.0} = 0.5$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the velocity ratio into the rearranged Bernoulli's equation. $p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 (1 - (\\frac{V_2}{V_1})^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 (1 - (0.5)^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 (1 - 0.25) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 (0.75)$.",
        "Step 7: Substitute the expression for ($p_2 - p_1$) into the definition of $C_{p,s}$. $C_{p,s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 (0.75)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2}$.",
