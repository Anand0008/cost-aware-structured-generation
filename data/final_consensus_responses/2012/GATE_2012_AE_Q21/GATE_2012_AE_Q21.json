      "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) is defined as the ratio of the useful propulsive power (thrust power) to the rate at which kinetic energy is imparted to the exhaust jet. For an ideal jet engine, the propulsive efficiency can be expressed as:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\text{Thrust Power}}{\\text{Kinetic Energy Added to Jet}} = \\frac{F V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e^2 - V_a^2)}$$\nWhere $F$ is the thrust, $V_a$ is the flight speed, $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity, and $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate of the working fluid. For an ideal jet, thrust $F = \\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)$. Substituting this into the efficiency equation:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e^2 - V_a^2)}$$\nUsing the difference of squares identity, $V_e^2 - V_a^2 = (V_e - V_a)(V_e + V_a)$:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{\\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)V_a}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}(V_e - V_a)(V_e + V_a)} = \\frac{2V_a}{V_e + V_a}$$\nTo find the ratio of flight speed to exhaust velocity for maximum propulsive efficiency, let $R = V_a / V_e$. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $V_e$:\n$$\\eta_p = \\frac{2(V_a/V_e)}{(V_e/V_e) + (V_a/V_e)} = \\frac{2R}{1 + R}$$\nTo maximize this function, we can observe its behavior. As $R$ increases, $\\eta_p$ increases. The maximum theoretical value for $\\eta_p$ is 1 (or 100%). This occurs when the numerator equals the denominator in the simplified form, i.e., $2R = 1 + R$, which implies $R = 1$. Therefore, when the flight speed ($V_a$) equals the exhaust velocity ($V_e$), the propulsive efficiency is theoretically 100%. This is a fundamental result in propulsion theory, confirmed by retrieved knowledge (Sutton-Biblarz, Ch. 2, \\u00a72.4), which states that the maximum value of $\\eta_p$ is 1 (or 100%) when $u/c = 1$ (where $u$ is flight speed and $c$ is exhaust velocity)."
