        "Calculate the axial component of the absolute velocity ($c_a$): $c_a = C_1 \\cos(\\alpha_1) = 120 \\cos(18^{\\circ}) \\approx 114.13$ m/s. This axial velocity is assumed constant through the stage.",
        "Calculate the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet ($c_{t1}$): $c_{t1} = C_1 \\sin(\\alpha_1) = 120 \\sin(18^{\\circ}) \\approx 37.08$ m/s.",
        "Determine the tangential component of the relative velocity at the rotor inlet ($w_{t1}$): $w_{t1} = c_{t1} - U = 37.08 - 200 = -162.92$ m/s. (Note: For a compressor, the relative tangential velocity is often considered as $U - c_{t1}$ for velocity triangle construction, which would be $200 - 37.08 = 162.92$ m/s, with the relative velocity vector pointing opposite to blade rotation in the velocity triangle diagram).",
        "Calculate the tangent of the relative flow angle at the rotor inlet ($\\beta_1$): $\\tan(\\beta_1) = \\frac{w_{t1}}{c_a} = \\frac{-162.92}{114.13} \\approx -1.4276$.",
        "Compute the relative flow angle at the rotor inlet: $\\beta_1 = \\arctan(-1.4276) \\approx -55.0^{\\circ}$. The negative sign indicates the direction of the relative tangential velocity component relative to the blade speed.",
        "The calculated magnitude of the relative flow angle is $|\\beta_1| \\approx 55.0^{\\circ}$. Given the options are positive, this suggests that the question might be asking for the magnitude or using a different sign convention for the angle. However, $55.0^{\\circ}$ is not among the exact options provided.",
        "The rotor turning angle (27°) is provided but not directly used in the calculation of the inlet blade angle based on the given absolute inlet conditions and blade speed. Without further information (e.g., degree of reaction or exit conditions), the inlet blade angle cannot be uniquely determined from the turning angle alone. The discrepancy between the calculated value and the options suggests a potential issue with the problem statement or options."
