      "reasoning": "The given differential equation is a second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients: $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \\frac{dy}{dt} - 2y = 0$. To find its general solution, we form the characteristic equation by replacing $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$ with $r^2$, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ with $r$, and $y$ with $1$. This yields the quadratic equation: $r^2 + r - 2 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(r+2)(r-1) = 0$. The roots are $r_1 = 1$ and $r_2 = -2$. Since these are distinct real roots, the general solution is given by the form $y(t) = A e^{r_1 t} + B e^{r_2 t}$, where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary constants. Substituting the roots, we obtain $y(t) = A e^{t} + B e^{-2t}$. This solution precisely matches option C (with constants A and B possibly swapped, as they are arbitrary)."
