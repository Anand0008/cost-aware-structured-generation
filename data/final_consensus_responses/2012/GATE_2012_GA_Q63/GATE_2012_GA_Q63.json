      "reasoning": "The question states that a prime number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, which can be written as $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This is a direct application of Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares. This theorem states that an odd prime number $p$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares (i.e., $p = x^2 + y^2$ for natural numbers $x$ and $y$) if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ or $p=2$. Since the question specifies a prime number with a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, it satisfies the condition $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, such a prime number can be expressed as the sum of squares of two natural numbers. For example, $5 = 1^2 + 2^2$, $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$, $17 = 1^2 + 4^2$, $29 = 2^2 + 5^2$. The other options (sum of cubes, sum of square roots, sum of cube roots) do not have such a general characterization for primes of this form."

        "Recall Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares (also known as the Christmas theorem), which directly addresses this property of prime numbers.",
        "Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares states that an odd prime number p can be expressed as the sum of two squares (p = x^2 + y^2 for integers x, y) if and only if p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}. Since the given prime satisfies p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}, it must be expressible in this form.",
        "Applying the theorem, since the prime number satisfies p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}, it can be expressed as the sum of squares of two natural numbers (positive integers).",
        "Verify with examples: For p=5, 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} and 5 = 1^2 + 2^2. For p=13, 13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} and 13 = 2^2 + 3^2. These examples confirm the theorem. This directly matches the form 'sum of squares of two natural numbers'. Other options like sums of cubes or roots are not generally valid for such primes."
