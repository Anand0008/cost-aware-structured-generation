      "reasoning": "The solution involves equating the mass generation rate from the burning propellant to the mass efflux rate through the nozzle, which is the condition for equilibrium chamber pressure in a solid rocket motor. First, convert the burning rate law to m/s and the chamber pressure from bar to Pascals. Calculate the burning rate (r) using the given pressure. Then, calculate the mass generation rate (ṁ_b = ρ_p A_b r). Equate this to the mass efflux rate through the nozzle (ṁ_e = p A_t / c*). Solve for the nozzle throat area (A_t), and finally, calculate the throat diameter (d_t = sqrt(4A_t/π)). The calculated diameter of approximately 37.8 mm rounds to 38 mm, matching option B."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. For equilibrium chamber pressure, the mass flow rate generated by propellant burning equals the mass flow rate through the nozzle: $\\dot{m}_g = \\dot{m}_n$.",
        "Step 2: Write the mass flow rate equations. Generation: $\\dot{m}_g = \\rho_p A_b r$, where $r = a P_c^n$ (Vieille's law). Nozzle flow: $\\dot{m}_n = (P_c A_t) / c^*$.",
        "Step 3: Set up the equilibrium equation: $\\rho_p A_b a P_c^n = (P_c A_t) / c^*$.",
        "Step 4: Solve for throat area $A_t$: $A_t = \\frac{\\rho_p A_b a P_c^n c^*}{P_c} = \\rho_p A_b a P_c^{n-1} c^*$.",
        "Step 5: Convert all units to SI. $\\rho_p = 1800 \\ \\text{kg/m}^3$, $A_b = 0.314 \\ \\text{m}^2$, $c^* = 1450 \\ \\text{m/s}$, $P_c = 50 \\ \\text{bar} = 50 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{Pa} = 5 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Pa}$. Burning rate law: $r = 6.65 \\times 10^{-3} P^{0.45} \\ \\text{mm/s}$. So $a = 6.65 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{mm/s/Pa}^{0.45} = 6.65 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m/s/Pa}^{0.45} = 6.65 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m/s/Pa}^{0.45}$, $n = 0.45$.",
        "Step 6: Compute $P_c^{n-1} = (5 \\times 10^6)^{0.45 - 1} = (5 \\times 10^6)^{-0.55}$. Alternatively, compute $r$ first: $r = 6.65 \\times 10^{-6} \\times (5 \\times 10^6)^{0.45} \\ \\text{m/s}$. Calculate $(5 \\times 10^6)^{0.45} \\approx 1034.0$. Thus $r \\approx 6.65 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 1034.0 = 0.006876 \\ \\text{m/s}$.",
        "Step 7: Compute $A_t = \\frac{\\rho_p A_b r c^*}{P_c} = \\frac{1800 \\times 0.314 \\times 0.006876 \\times 1450}{5 \\times 10^6} \\approx 0.001127 \\ \\text{m}^2$.",
        "Step 8: Find throat diameter: $A_t = \\pi d_t^2 / 4 \\Rightarrow d_t = \\sqrt{4 A_t / \\pi} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 0.001127 / \\pi} \\approx 0.03788 \\ \\text{m} = 37.88 \\ \\text{mm} \\approx 38 \\ \\text{mm}$.",
