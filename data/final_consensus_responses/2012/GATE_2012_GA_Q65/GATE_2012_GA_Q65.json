      "reasoning": "The passage states: 'Progress was taken for granted and social scientists attempted to discover its laws and phases.' The phrase 'taken for granted' directly implies that social scientists 'did not question that progress was a fact.' Let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A. did not question that progress was a fact.** This aligns perfectly with 'Progress was taken for granted.' If something is taken for granted, it is accepted without question.\n*   **B. did not approve of Biology.** The passage says theories were 'inspired less by Biology than by the conviction of social scientists'. This indicates a different primary source of inspiration, not disapproval of Biology itself.\n*   **C. framed the laws of progress.** The passage states they 'attempted to discover its laws and phases.' Attempting to discover is not the same as successfully framing or establishing them as definitive laws.\n*   **D. emphasized Biology over Social Sciences.** This directly contradicts the passage, which states they were 'inspired less by Biology than by the conviction of social scientists'.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most accurate inference that can be drawn directly from the given passage."
