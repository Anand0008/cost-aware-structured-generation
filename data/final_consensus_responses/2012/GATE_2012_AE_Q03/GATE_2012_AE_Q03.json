      "confidence_type": "single_model",
      "reasoning": "An aircraft in trimmed condition is defined as the state where the net pitching moment about its center of gravity (CG) is zero. This ensures that the aircraft maintains a constant pitch attitude without requiring continuous control input from the pilot. This definition is explicitly supported by retrieved knowledge, stating that an airplane is trimmed when the net moment about its center of gravity is zero (M_cg = 0). The aerodynamic center (AC) is a point where the pitching moment coefficient is independent of the angle of attack, but the moment at the AC is generally not zero. Other options like 25% MAC or 50% wing root chord are specific locations that do not universally define the trimmed condition for the entire aircraft. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the term 'trimmed condition'. In aerospace engineering, 'trimmed condition' refers to a state of equilibrium where the aircraft maintains a steady flight path (e.g., constant altitude, constant speed, constant pitch attitude) without requiring continuous control inputs from the pilot. This implies that net forces and moments are zero.",
        "For an aircraft to be in equilibrium, specifically in trimmed flight, the net forces and net moments acting on it must be zero. For pitching motion, this means the sum of all pitching moments must be zero.",
        "In flight mechanics and stability analysis, pitching moments are typically summed about the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). This is because the CG is the point about which the aircraft rotates, and forces acting through the CG do not create a moment about it.",
        "Combining these points, for an aircraft to be in trimmed flight, the sum of all pitching moments (from the wing, tail, fuselage, thrust, etc.) about its center of gravity must be zero. This condition ensures no angular acceleration in pitch and maintains a steady pitch attitude without continuous pilot input.",
        "Based on the definition of trimmed flight and the principles of equilibrium, the net pitching moment must be zero about the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). Therefore, option B, 'its center of gravity', is the correct answer."
