        "Determine the radial velocity component V_r at r = 0.5 m. Using mass conservation for steady, incompressible, axisymmetric flow, the mass flow rate through any cylindrical surface is constant: ρ(2πrL)V_r = constant. Given V_r(R) = 1 m/s at the pipe surface (r = R), then V_r(r) = V_r(R) × (R/r) = 1 × (0.005/0.5) = 0.01 m/s.",
        "Determine the tangential velocity component V_θ at the pipe surface (r = R). Since the fluid emerges radially relative to the pipe surface (no relative tangential velocity), in the absolute frame, it acquires the tangential velocity of the pipe due to the no-slip condition. Thus, at r = R, V_θ(R) = ωR = 2π × 0.005 ≈ 0.03142 m/s.",
        "Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum for inviscid flow outside the pipe (free vortex model). Since there are no external torques, the angular momentum per unit mass (rV_θ) remains constant along a streamline. Thus, r V_θ(r) = R V_θ(R) = ωR².",
        "Compute the tangential velocity V_θ at the specified radial location r = 0.5 m: V_θ = (ωR²) / r = (2π × (0.005)²) / 0.5 = (2π × 2.5e-5) / 0.5 = 5πe-5 / 0.5 = 10πe-5 ≈ 3.1416e-4 m/s = 0.00031416 m/s.",

The calculated value (≈ 0.000314 m/s) is significantly smaller than any of the typical options (e.g., 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.31 m/s), suggesting a possible error in the problem statement or options.
