The energy balance states that the total enthalpy of the incoming air plus the heat added by the fuel must equal the total enthalpy of the outgoing hot gases. Given different specific heats for air ($c_{p,a}$) and hot gases ($c_{p,g}$), the energy balance equation is: \n\n$\\dot{m}_a c_{p,a} T_{03} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$ \n\nDividing by the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) and defining $f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$, we get: \n\n$c_{p,a} T_{03} + f Q_R = (1 + f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$ \n\nRearranging to solve for $f$: \n\n$c_{p,a} T_{03} + f Q_R = c_{p,g} T_{04} + f c_{p,g} T_{04}$ \n$f Q_R - f c_{p,g} T_{04} = c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}$ \n$f (Q_R - c_{p,g} T_{04}) = c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}$ \n$f = \\frac{c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}}{Q_R - c_{p,g} T_{04}}$ \n\nGiven values: \n$T_{03} = 600$ K \n$T_{04} = 1200$ K \n$Q_R = 44$ MJ/kg = $44 \\times 10^3$ kJ/kg \n$c_{p,a} = 1.005$ kJ/kg.K \n$c_{p,g} = 1.147$ kJ/kg.K \n\nSubstitute the values: \nNumerator: $(1.147 \\text{ kJ/kg.K} \\times 1200 \\text{ K}) - (1.005 \\text{ kJ/kg.K} \\times 600 \\text{ K})$ \n$= 1376.4 \\text{ kJ/kg} - 603 \\text{ kJ/kg} = 773.4 \\text{ kJ/kg}$ \n\nDenominator: $(44 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kJ/kg}) - (1.147 \\text{ kJ/kg.K} \\times 1200 \\text{ K})$ \n$= 44000 \\text{ kJ/kg} - 1376.4 \\text{ kJ/kg} = 42623.6 \\text{ kJ/kg}$ \n\n$f = \\frac{773.4}{42623.6} \\approx 0.018145$ \n\nThis value is approximately 0.018, which matches option B."

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and the quantity to be calculated. Given: inlet stagnation temperature ($T_{03}=600$ K), exit stagnation temperature ($T_{04}=1200$ K), heating value of fuel ($Q_R=44$ MJ/kg), specific heat for air ($c_{p,a}=1.005$ kJ/kg·K), and specific heat for hot gases ($c_{p,g}=1.147$ kJ/kg·K). We need to find the fuel-to-air ratio ($f$).",
        "Step 2: Write the steady-flow energy balance for the combustion chamber, assuming adiabatic walls, constant pressure, and complete combustion: $\\dot{m}_a c_{p,a} T_{03} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$.",
        "Step 3: Define the fuel-to-air ratio ($f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$) and divide the energy balance equation by $\\dot{m}_a$: $c_{p,a} T_{03} + f Q_R = (1+f) c_{p,g} T_{04}$.",
        "Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for $f$: $f Q_R - f c_{p,g} T_{04} = c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}$ \\u2192 $f(Q_R - c_{p,g} T_{04}) = c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}$ \\u2192 $f = \\frac{c_{p,g} T_{04} - c_{p,a} T_{03}}{Q_R - c_{p,g} T_{04}}$.",
        "Step 5: Ensure all units are consistent. Convert the heating value of fuel from MJ/kg to kJ/kg: $Q_R = 44 \\text{ MJ/kg} = 44000 \\text{ kJ/kg}$. Now, compute the terms in the numerator and denominator: $c_{p,g} T_{04} = 1.147 \\text{ kJ/kg\\cdot K} \\times 1200 \\text{ K} = 1376.4 \\text{ kJ/kg}$. $c_{p,a} T_{03} = 1.005 \\text{ kJ/kg\\cdot K} \\times 600 \\text{ K} = 603 \\text{ kJ/kg}$.",
