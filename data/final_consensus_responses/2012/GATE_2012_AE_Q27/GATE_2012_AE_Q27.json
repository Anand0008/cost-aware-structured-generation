The fundamental relationship for time to climb is given by $t = \\int_{h_1}^{h_2} \\frac{dh}{R/C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rate of Climb (R/C) function.**\nAssume a linear relationship for R/C with altitude $h$: $R/C = A + Bh$.\nGiven:\n- At sea level ($h=0$ m), $R/C = 300$ m/s.\n- At $h=2500$ m, $R/C = 150$ m/s.\n\nUsing the first condition:\n$300 = A + B(0) \\implies A = 300$\n\nUsing the second condition:\n$150 = A + B(2500)$\n$150 = 300 + B(2500)$\n$B(2500) = 150 - 300 = -150$\n$B = \\frac{-150}{2500} = -0.06$\n\nSo, the R/C function is: $R/C = 300 - 0.06h$ (m/s).\n\n**Step 2: Set up the integral for time to climb.**\nThe aircraft climbs from $h_1 = 500$ m to $h_2 = 3000$ m.\n$t = \\int_{500}^{3000} \\frac{dh}{300 - 0.06h}$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral.**\nLet $u = 300 - 0.06h$.\nThen, $du = -0.06 dh \\implies dh = -\\frac{1}{0.06} du = -\\frac{100}{6} du = -\\frac{50}{3} du$.\n\nChange the limits of integration:\n- When $h = 500$ m, $u_1 = 300 - 0.06(500) = 300 - 30 = 270$.\n- When $h = 3000$ m, $u_2 = 300 - 0.06(3000) = 300 - 180 = 120$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$t = \\int_{270}^{120} \\frac{-50/3}{u} du$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\int_{270}^{120} \\frac{1}{u} du$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} [\\ln|u|]_{270}^{120}$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} (\\ln(120) - \\ln(270))$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{120}{270}\\right)$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{27}\\right)$\n$t = -\\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)$\n\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)$\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\ln(2.25)$\n\nCalculate the numerical value:\n$\\ln(2.25) \\approx 0.81093$\n$t = \\frac{50}{3} \\times 0.81093 \\approx 16.6667 \\times 0.81093 \\approx 13.5155$ seconds.\n\nThis value (13.5155 s) falls within the specified correct answer range of 13 to 14 seconds."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the problem and model the Rate of Climb (R/C). The question asks for the time to climb between two altitudes given varying R/C. Assume a linear relationship for R/C with altitude h. Given R/C = 300 m/s at h=0 and R/C = 150 m/s at h=2500 m, model R/C as R/C = a - b h. Solving for constants: a = 300 (at h=0), and b = (300 - 150) / 2500 = 150 / 2500 = 0.06. Thus, R/C = 300 - 0.06h (m/s).",
        "Step 2: Write the general formula for time to climb. The time (t) to climb from an initial altitude h₁ to a final altitude h₂ is given by the integral: t = \\int_{h_1}^{h_2} (dh / (R/C)).",
        "Step 3: Substitute the derived R/C function and the given altitude limits into the integral. The aircraft climbs from h₁ = 500 m to h₂ = 3000 m. So, t = \\int_{500}^{3000} dh / (300 - 0.06h).",
        "Step 4: Perform the integration using substitution. Let u = 300 - 0.06h. Then, differentiate u with respect to h: du = -0.06 dh, which implies dh = -du/0.06. Change the limits of integration according to the substitution: When h = 500 m, u = 300 - 0.06(500) = 300 - 30 = 270. When h = 3000 m, u = 300 - 0.06(3000) = 300 - 180 = 120.",
        "Step 5: Substitute u and du into the integral and evaluate. The integral becomes t = \\int_{u=270}^{120} (1/u) * (-du/0.06). Rearrange the integral by swapping the limits and changing the sign: t = (1/0.06) \\int_{120}^{270} (1/u) du. Integrate (1/u) to get ln|u|: t = (1/0.06) [ln u]_{120}^{270} = (50/3) [ln u]_{120}^{270}.",
        "Step 6: Apply the limits of integration and simplify. t = (50/3) (ln 270 - ln 120). Using the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we get t = (50/3) ln(270/120). Simplify the ratio: 270/120 = 27/12 = 9/4 = 2.25. So, t = (50/3) ln(2.25).",
        "Step 7: Compute the numerical value. Calculate ln(2.25) ≈ 0.81093. Then, t ≈ (50/3) * 0.81093 ≈ 13.5155 seconds."
