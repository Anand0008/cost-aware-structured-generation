      "reasoning": "Let the five different natural numbers be $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5$. Natural numbers are positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). The problem states they must be different.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of these five numbers is given as 12. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:\n$$\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of numbers}}{\\text{Count of numbers}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$12 = \\frac{n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5}{5}$$\nTo find the sum of the five numbers:\n$$n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 = 12 \\times 5 = 60$$\nTo maximize one number (let's say $n_5$), the other four numbers ($n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4$) must be as small as possible while still being different natural numbers.\n\nThe smallest possible different natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nSo, let:\n$n_1 = 1$\n$n_2 = 2$\n$n_3 = 3$\n$n_4 = 4$\n\nNow, substitute these minimum values into the sum equation:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + n_5 = 60$$\n$$10 + n_5 = 60$$\n$$n_5 = 60 - 10$$\n$$n_5 = 50$$\nThus, the largest possible value among the numbers is 50. This is achievable with the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 50}. Any larger value for $n_5$ would require the sum of the other four distinct natural numbers to be less than 10, which is impossible (minimum sum is 10). Therefore, the correct answer is C."
