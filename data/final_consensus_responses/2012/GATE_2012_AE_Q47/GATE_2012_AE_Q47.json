      "reasoning": "Buckling is a stability failure under compressive stress. Internal pressurization induces tensile hoop stress in the fuselage skin. This tensile pre-stress counteracts any compressive stresses that might arise from bending moments or external aerodynamic loads, thereby stabilizing the skin and delaying the onset of buckling. Options B, C, and D would all promote buckling: placing stiffeners farther apart increases the unsupported panel width, reducing critical buckling stress; reducing skin thickness decreases buckling resistance; and decreasing internal pressure removes the beneficial pre-tensioning effect."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand Buckling: Buckling is a structural instability where thin elements (like fuselage skin) deform out of their original plane when subjected to compressive loads.",
        "Recall Plate Buckling Theory: The critical buckling stress ($\\sigma_{cr}$) for a plate is proportional to the square of the ratio of skin thickness to unsupported width, i.e., $\\sigma_{cr} \\propto (t/b)^2$. Stiffeners subdivide the skin into smaller panels, effectively reducing the unsupported width 'b'.",
        "Analyze the Role of Internal Pressure: Commercial aircraft fuselages are pressurized to maintain cabin comfort. This internal pressure creates tensile stresses in the fuselage skin, specifically circumferential (hoop) stress, given by $\\sigma_{hoop} = Pr/t$.",
        "Effect of Tensile Stress on Buckling: Since buckling is a compressive failure mode, the tensile pre-stress induced by internal pressure counteracts any additional compressive forces that might arise from flight loads. This effectively increases the critical compressive load required to initiate buckling, thereby delaying its onset.",
        "Evaluate Option A ('increasing internal pressure'): Increasing internal pressure enhances the beneficial tensile pre-stress in the skin, making it more resistant to buckling. This is the correct action to delay buckling.",
        "Evaluate Option B ('placing stiffeners farther apart'): Placing stiffeners farther apart increases the unsupported width ('b') of the skin panels. According to the plate buckling formula, increasing 'b' reduces buckling resistance, making the skin more prone to buckling. This is incorrect.",
        "Evaluate Option C ('reducing skin thickness'): Reducing skin thickness ('t') decreases the critical buckling stress (as $\\sigma_{cr} \\propto t^2$), making the skin more prone to buckling. This is incorrect.",
        "Evaluate Option D ('placing stiffeners farther and decreasing internal pressure'): This option combines two actions that would both increase the likelihood of buckling (increasing 'b' and reducing the beneficial tensile pre-stress). This is incorrect."

A key parameter governing a plate's resistance to buckling is its width-to-thickness ratio (b/t); a large b/t ratio leads to a low critical buckling stress. A highly effective method to improve buckling resistance is to attach reinforcing members, called stiffeners, which essentially divide one wide, unstable plate into an assembly of smaller, more stable plates. This significantly reduces the effective 'b' for each sub-panel, thereby increasing the stress required to cause buckling.",
