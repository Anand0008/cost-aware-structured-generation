      "reasoning": "Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is a standardized measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine, defined as the total impulse per unit of propellant weight consumed. The standard formula is $I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m}g_0}$, where $F$ is thrust, $\\dot{m}$ is propellant mass flow rate, and $g_0$ is the standard acceleration due to gravity. This $g_0$ is universally defined as the standard acceleration due to gravity at Earth's sea level, approximately $9.80665 \\text{ m/s}^2$. This value is a constant used for standardization and comparability across different environments, irrespective of the actual local gravitational acceleration at the rocket's operating location (e.g., Mars, or a crater on Mars). Therefore, specific impulse is always normalized by Earth's standard sea level gravity."
