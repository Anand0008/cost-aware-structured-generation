      "reasoning": "The sentence describes administrators implementing 'yet another unreasonable measure,' arguing that 'one more would hardly make a difference.' This implies that the existing measures are already in a state where adding another negative one won't significantly worsen the situation or public perception. 'Unpopular' is the most appropriate word because if the measures are already disliked by many, adding another 'unreasonable measure' would indeed 'hardly make a difference' to their existing unpopularity. This option perfectly fits the logical flow and implied meaning of the sentence.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A. reflective:** Means thoughtful or considering. This does not fit the context of 'unreasonable measure' or the idea that 'one more would hardly make a difference.'\n*   **B. utopian:** Means idealistic or perfect. This is the opposite of what is implied by 'unreasonable measure.'\n*   **C. luxuriant:** Means rich, abundant, or lush. This word is completely out of context for describing administrative measures."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Read the entire sentence carefully to grasp its overall meaning and tone. Identify the key information: administrators are implementing an 'unreasonable measure' and justifying it by arguing that previous measures were already in a certain state, implying 'one more would hardly make a difference.'",
        "Identify the blank's role: it requires an adjective to describe the existing measures. Analyze the logical link in the argument: 'the measures were already ___ and one more would hardly make a difference.' The word must describe a state of the existing measures that makes adding another 'unreasonable' one seem insignificant or not impactful.",
        "Analyze the phrase 'one more would hardly make a difference.' This suggests the existing measures are already in a negative or undesirable state, such that an additional negative measure won't significantly worsen the perception or impact. Now, evaluate each option for semantic and contextual fit.",
        "Evaluate option A, 'reflective' (meaning thoughtful or showing deep thought). This does not align with the context of an 'unreasonable measure' or the argument that 'one more would hardly make a difference,' as thoughtful measures would not logically lead to such a justification.",
        "Evaluate option B, 'utopian' (meaning idealistically perfect). This contradicts the context of an 'unreasonable measure' and the overall negative tone of the sentence.",
        "Evaluate option C, 'luxuriant' (meaning rich, lush, or abundant). This word is semantically irrelevant to describing policies or measures in this context.",
        "Evaluate option D, 'unpopular' (meaning disliked by many). This fits perfectly: if the measures are already unpopular, the administrators' flawed argument is that adding another unreasonable one would 'hardly make a difference' to their already negative reception. Therefore, 'unpopular' is the most appropriate choice, making the sentence logically coherent and consistent with the implied meaning."
