      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the volume of a solid generated by rotating a region about the x-axis. The region is bounded by the line $y=1$ and the semi-circle $y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.\n\n1.  **Geometric Interpretation:** The equation of the semi-circle $y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ can be rewritten as $(y-1) = -\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. Squaring both sides yields $(y-1)^2 = 1 - x^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. Since $y-1 = -\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, it implies $y-1 \\le 0$, so $y \\le 1$. This equation represents the lower semi-circle of a circle centered at $(0,1)$ with a radius of $1$. The line $y=1$ forms the upper boundary of the region. The region extends from $x=-1$ to $x=1$.\n\n2.  **Method of Volume Calculation:** The Washer Method is appropriate for finding the volume of revolution about the x-axis. The outer radius $R(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the line $y=1$, so $R(x) = 1$. The inner radius $r(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the semi-circle $y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, so $r(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.\n\n3.  **Setting up the Integral:** The volume $V$ is given by the integral:\n    $$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (R(x))^2 - (r(x))^2 ] dx$$\n    $$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (1)^2 - (1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 ] dx$$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Integrand:** Expand the term $(1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2$:\n    $$(1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + (1 - x^2) = 2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$$\n    Substitute this back into the integral:\n    $$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ 1 - (2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}) ] dx$$\n    $$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ 1 - 2 + x^2 + 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} ] dx$$\n    $$V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ x^2 - 1 + 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} ] dx$$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Integral:** Split the integral into two parts:\n    *   **Part 1:** $\\int_{-1}^{1} (x^2 - 1) dx$\n        $$= \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3} - x\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left(\\frac{1^3}{3} - 1\\right) - \\left(\\frac{(-1)^3}{3} - (-1)\\right)$$\n        $$= \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - 1\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} + 1\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{3}$$\n    *   **Part 2:** $\\int_{-1}^{1} 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$\n        The integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$ represents the area of a semi-circle of radius $1$. The area of a full circle is $\\pi r^2$, so the area of a semi-circle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2$. For $r=1$, this area is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n        Therefore, $2 \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\pi$.\n\n6.  **Combining the Results:**\n    $$V = \\pi \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) + \\pi \\right] = \\pi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$$\n\nThis result matches option A."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the region bounded by the line y=1 and the semi-circle y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2} from x=-1 to x=1. The rotation is about the x-axis.",
        "Step 2: Rewrite the equation of the semi-circle to understand its geometry. $y - 1 = -\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\implies (y-1)^2 = 1 - x^2 \\implies x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. Since $y-1 \\le 0$, this is the lower half of a circle centered at $(0,1)$ with radius $1$.",
        "Step 3: Determine the appropriate method for calculating the volume of revolution. Since the region is bounded by two curves and does not touch the axis of rotation, the Washer Method is used.",
        "Step 4: Define the outer radius $R(x)$ and inner radius $r(x)$. For rotation about the x-axis, $R(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the upper curve ($y=1$), so $R(x) = 1$. The inner radius $r(x)$ is the distance from the x-axis to the lower curve ($y = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$), so $r(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.",
        "Step 5: Determine the limits of integration for $x$. The semi-circle $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ exists for $x$ values from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, the limits are $a=-1$ and $b=1$.",
        "Step 6: Set up the definite integral using the Washer Method formula: $V = \\pi \\int_a^b [ (R(x))^2 - (r(x))^2 ] dx$. Substitute the radii and limits: $V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [ (1)^2 - (1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 ] dx$.",
        "Step 7: Simplify the integrand algebraically. Expand $(1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + (1 - x^2) = 2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. Then, $1 - (2 - x^2 - 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x^2 - 1 + 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.",
        "Step 8: Evaluate the integral. Split the integral into two parts: $\\int_{-1}^{1} (x^2 - 1) dx$ and $\\int_{-1}^{1} 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$. The first part evaluates to $-4/3$. The second part represents twice the area of a semi-circle of radius 1, which is $2 \\times (\\pi/2) = \\pi$. Combine these to get $V = \\pi [ -4/3 + \\pi ] = \\pi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.",
        "Step 9: The final volume is $V = \\pi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$."

For rotation about the x-axis, the formula is $V = 2\\pi \\int_c^d y \\cdot [f(y) - g(y)] dy$, where $f(y)$ and $g(y)$ define the right and left boundaries in terms of $y$.
