      "reasoning": "For a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel, the principal stresses on the surface are equal, `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h$` (hoop/tangential stress), and the radial stress `$\\sigma_3 \\approx 0$` (negligible for thin walls). The hoop stress is given by `$\\sigma_h = \\frac{pR}{2t}$`, where `p` is the pressure difference across the wall.\n\n1) **Internal Pressure Case (as in linked Q54):**\n- Internal pressure `p_i = p`, external `p_o = 0`.\n- `$\\sigma_h$` is tensile: `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = +\\sigma_h = +\\frac{pR}{2t}$`.\n- The Von Mises equivalent stress `$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}}$` is calculated as:\n  `$$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}[(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1)^2]}$$`\n  Substituting `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h$` and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$`:\n  `$$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}[(\\sigma_h-\\sigma_h)^2 + (\\sigma_h-0)^2 + (0-\\sigma_h)^2]} = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}[0 + \\sigma_h^2 + \\sigma_h^2]} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_h^2} = |\\sigma_h|$$`\n- Yielding occurs when `$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = |\\sigma_h| = \\sigma_Y$`, where `$\\sigma_Y$` is the yield strength. This gives the yield pressure `p_Y`.\n\n2) **External Pressure Case (this question):**\n- Vessel evacuated: `p_i = 0`, external pressure `p_o = p`.\n- `$\\sigma_h$` is compressive: `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = -\\sigma_h = -\\frac{pR}{2t}$`.\n- When these compressive stresses are substituted into the Von Mises criterion, the calculation for `$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}}$` remains the same because it depends on the *differences* of principal stresses and their squares, making the sign irrelevant:\n  `$$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = |-\\sigma_h| = |\\sigma_h|$$`\n- Therefore, yielding occurs when `$\\sigma_{\\text{vm}} = |\\sigma_h| = \\sigma_Y$`, which means the magnitude of the pressure required to cause yielding is the same as in the internal pressure case.\n\n3) **Conclusion:** The problem explicitly states to assume elastic stability until yield, which means buckling under external pressure is not considered. Under this assumption, the Von Mises yield criterion predicts that yielding occurs at the same magnitude of pressure, `p_Y`, whether it's internal or external. Hence, option C: 'occurs at about the same pressure `p_Y`' is correct."

        "Recall that for a thin spherical shell under a pressure difference p across the wall, the membrane stress magnitude is `$\\sigma = p r / (2t)$`. This formula applies for both internal pressure (tensile stress) and external pressure (compressive stress).",
        "Identify the principal stress state for a thin-walled spherical vessel. The radial stress is negligible, so `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma$` (hoop stresses) and `$\\sigma_3 \\approx 0$` (radial stress).",

        "Substitute `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma$` and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$` into the Von Mises formula, which simplifies to `$\\sigma_v = |\\sigma|$`.",

For a spherical vessel, `$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_h$` and `$\\sigma_3 = 0$`. The maximum shear stress is `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{|\\sigma_h - 0|}{2} = \\frac{|\\sigma_h|}{2}$`. So, `$\\frac{|\\sigma_h|}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{2}$`, which means `$\\left| \\frac{pD}{4t} \\right| = \\sigma_Y$`. This leads to the same result as Von Mises for this specific stress state.",

Cons: Generally more conservative than Von Mises for most stress states, though for a spherical vessel (`$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3 = 0$`), both Tresca and Von Mises give the same yield pressure.
