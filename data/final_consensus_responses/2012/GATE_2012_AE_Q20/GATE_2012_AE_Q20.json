      "reasoning": "Bernoulli's equation is a statement of conservation of energy for an ideal fluid. Its applicability depends critically on the flow assumptions:\n\n1.  **General Inviscid, Incompressible, Steady Flow:** When the flow is inviscid, incompressible, and steady, Bernoulli's equation is valid *only along a single streamline*. This is because its derivation typically involves integrating Euler's equation (which assumes inviscid flow) along a streamline. If the flow is rotational, the constant value of Bernoulli's equation will differ from one streamline to another.\n\n2.  **Potential Flow (Irrotational, Inviscid, Incompressible, Steady Flow):** Potential flow is a special case of inviscid, incompressible, steady flow where the flow is also *irrotational*. For irrotational flow, the vorticity is zero everywhere. This condition implies that the Bernoulli constant is the same for *all streamlines* throughout the entire flow field. Therefore, in potential flow, Bernoulli's equation can be applied *between any two points* in the flow, regardless of whether they lie on the same streamline or not.\n\nBased on this, Option A correctly distinguishes between the two scenarios: 'only along a streamline in inviscid flow' (referring to general inviscid flow which may be rotational) and 'between any two points in potential flow' (where irrotationality allows broader application)."
