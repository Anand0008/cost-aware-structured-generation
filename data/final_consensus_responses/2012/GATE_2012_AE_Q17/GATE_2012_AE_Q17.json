      "reasoning": "The elevator is the primary control surface for longitudinal control, generating pitching moments. Its effectiveness ($C_{m_{\\delta_e}}$) quantifies how much pitching moment it can produce for a given deflection. When the center of gravity (CG) is moved forward, the aircraft becomes more statically stable, which means it develops a larger nose-down pitching moment for a given angle of attack. To trim the aircraft (i.e., achieve zero pitching moment) or to perform maneuvers requiring nose-up moments (like flaring for landing at high lift coefficients), the elevator must generate a sufficient nose-up pitching moment to counteract this inherent nose-down moment. If the CG is too far forward, even with maximum elevator deflection, the elevator might not be able to generate enough nose-up moment to achieve trim or control. Therefore, the elevator's control effectiveness directly limits how far forward the CG can be placed while maintaining adequate control authority for trimming and maneuvering. The aft-most CG location, conversely, is determined by static stability requirements (i.e., the CG must remain ahead of the neutral point for positive static margin), which is largely independent of elevator effectiveness."

        "A forward Center of Gravity (CG) position increases static longitudinal stability, leading to a larger inherent nose-down pitching moment that needs to be counteracted.",
        "To trim the aircraft at a forward CG, especially under critical conditions like landing flare (high lift coefficient), the elevator must generate a sufficient nose-up pitching moment.",
        "The required elevator deflection for trim is inversely proportional to the elevator control effectiveness ($|C_{m_{\\delta_e}}|$). A higher effectiveness means less deflection is needed to produce the necessary balancing moment.",
        "The forward-most allowable CG location is limited by the elevator's maximum authority to generate the required nose-up pitching moment. A more effective elevator (higher $|C_{m_{\\delta_e}}|$) allows the CG to be placed further forward.",
