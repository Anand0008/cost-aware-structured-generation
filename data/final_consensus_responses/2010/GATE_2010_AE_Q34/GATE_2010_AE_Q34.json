        "name": "3D Tangent Vector Approach / Directional Derivative Maximization",
        "description": "Consider the steepest path on the surface as a 3D curve. The direction vector in the tangent plane that gives the steepest ascent is (∂z/∂x, ∂z/∂y, |∇z|²) after normalization, which yields a unit vector with a k-component. Alternatively, one can maximize the directional derivative D_u z = ∇z ⋅ u subject to ||u|| = 1 using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which proves that the maximum occurs when u is parallel to ∇z.",
        "pros_cons": "3D Tangent Vector Approach: Pros: More geometrically accurate for the path on the surface. Cons: More complex; often not the standard definition of 'steepest slope direction' in 2D. Directional Derivative Maximization: Pros: Reinforces theoretical understanding of why gradient gives steepest direction. Cons: Longer and more algebraic than directly using the known result.",
        "when_to_use": "3D Tangent Vector Approach: When asked for the 3D direction of the path of steepest ascent on the surface, not just its horizontal projection. Directional Derivative Maximization: Useful when proving the property of gradient or in more theoretical exam questions."
