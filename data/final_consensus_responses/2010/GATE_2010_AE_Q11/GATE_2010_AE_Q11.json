      "reasoning": "The integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{dx}{x^2}$ is improper because the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ has an infinite discontinuity at $x=0$, which lies within the interval $[-1, 1]$. To evaluate such an integral, it must be split into two parts at the point of discontinuity: $\\int_{-1}^{0} \\frac{dx}{x^2} + \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{dx}{x^2}$. Each part is then evaluated as a limit. For the second part: $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{dx}{x^2} = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\varepsilon}^{1} x^{-2} dx$. Evaluating the antiderivative, we get $[-x^{-1}]_{\\varepsilon}^{1}$. Applying the limits: $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^+} (-1^{-1} - (-\\varepsilon^{-1})) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^+} (-1 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$, $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$ approaches positive infinity. Therefore, $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{dx}{x^2}$ diverges to $+\\infty$. Since at least one of the component improper integrals diverges, the original definite integral does not exist (it is divergent). Hence, the correct answer is that the integral does not exist."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the integral type. The integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$ is an improper integral of Type II because the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ has an infinite discontinuity at $x=0$, which lies within the interval of integration $[-1, 1]$.",
        "Step 2: Split the integral at the discontinuity. Split the integral into two parts at the point of discontinuity $x=0$: $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx + \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.",
        "Step 3: Define each sub-integral as a limit. Evaluate each improper integral using the limit definition:\n$\\int_{-1}^{0} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\lim_{a \\to 0^-} \\int_{-1}^{a} x^{-2} dx$\n$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\lim_{b \\to 0^+} \\int_{b}^{1} x^{-2} dx$",
        "Step 4: Find the antiderivative of the integrand. The antiderivative of $x^{-2}$ is $\\int x^{-2} dx = -x^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} + C$.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate the first sub-integral. For the first part: $\\lim_{a \\to 0^-} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{x} \\right]_{-1}^{a} = \\lim_{a \\to 0^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{a} - (-\\frac{1}{-1}) \\right) = \\lim_{a \\to 0^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{a} - 1 \\right)$. As $a \\to 0^-$, $-1/a \\to +\\infty$. Thus, this integral diverges to $+\\infty$.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate the second sub-integral. For the second part: $\\lim_{b \\to 0^+} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{x} \\right]_{b}^{1} = \\lim_{b \\to 0^+} \\left( -\\frac{1}{1} - (-\\frac{1}{b}) \\right) = \\lim_{b \\to 0^+} \\left( -1 + \\frac{1}{b} \\right)$. As $b \\to 0^+$, $1/b \\to +\\infty$. Thus, this integral also diverges to $+\\infty$.",
        "Step 7: Conclude the existence of the original integral. Since at least one of the component improper integrals diverges (in this case, both do), the original integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$ does not converge to a finite value and therefore does not exist.",

      "Mathematics": "Improper integrals are an advanced topic in integral calculus, building on the foundations of definite integrals and properties of limits.",
      "Numerical Methods": "Improper integrals often require specialized numerical integration techniques (e.g., adaptive quadrature, variable transformations) to handle singularities accurately when analytical solutions are not feasible.",
      "Physics": "Divergent integrals appear in classical field theories (e.g., infinite self-energy of point charges), motivating regularization and renormalization techniques.",
      "Physics (Electromagnetism/Gravitation)": "Many fundamental laws in physics, such as Coulomb's Law and Newton's Law of Gravitation, involve inverse square relationships ($1/r^2$). Integrals involving these functions can lead to singularities at the origin, requiring the careful application of improper integral concepts to calculate quantities like potential energy or total force.",
      "Probability and Statistics": "Improper integrals are fundamental for defining continuous probability distributions and their moments, and are used to normalize probability density functions defined on infinite or semi-infinite intervals. The concept of convergence and divergence is crucial."
