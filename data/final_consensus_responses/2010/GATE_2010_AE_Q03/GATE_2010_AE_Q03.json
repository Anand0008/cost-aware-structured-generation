      "reasoning": "For an aircraft climbing at a constant speed in a straight line (rectilinear flight), the forces perpendicular to the flight path must be balanced. This balance is given by the equation: $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$, where $L$ is lift, $W$ is weight, and $\\gamma$ is the flight path angle (angle of climb). The load factor $n$ is defined as the ratio of lift to weight, i.e., $n = L/W$. Substituting the lift equation, we get $n = (W \\cos(\\gamma)) / W = \\cos(\\gamma)$. Since the aircraft is climbing at a 'steep angle of climb', $\\gamma$ is positive and greater than 0 degrees (and less than 90 degrees for a practical climb). For any $\\gamma$ such that $0 < \\gamma < 90^{\\circ}$, the value of $\\cos(\\gamma)$ is positive but less than 1.0. Therefore, the load factor $n$ is positive but less than 1.0. This confirms option C."

        "Step 1: Understand the flight condition. The aircraft is climbing at a constant speed in a straight line at a steep angle of climb. This implies steady, unaccelerated rectilinear flight.",
        "Step 1: Identify the forces acting on the aircraft (Lift L, Drag D, Thrust T, Weight W) and establish the force balance condition for steady, straight-line climb. For motion along a straight line at constant speed, the net force perpendicular to the flight path is zero.",
        "Step 2: Resolve the weight vector. The weight ($W$) acts vertically downward. Its component perpendicular to the flight path (inclined at angle $\\gamma$ to the horizontal) is $W \\cos(\\gamma)$. Apply Newton's Second Law for force balance perpendicular to the flight path, meaning the net force perpendicular to the velocity vector is zero.",
        "Step 3: From the force balance perpendicular to the flight path, the lift ($L$) must balance the perpendicular component of weight. Thus, $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the flight path angle.",
        "Step 4: Define the load factor ($n$) as the ratio of lift to weight: $n = L/W$. Substitute the expression for $L$ from the previous step into this definition.",
        "Step 5: Performing the substitution, we get $n = (W \\cos(\\gamma)) / W = \\cos(\\gamma)$.",
        "Step 6: For a steady climb, the flight path angle $\\gamma$ is positive ($0^\\circ < \\gamma < 90^\\circ$). In this range, the value of $\\cos(\\gamma)$ is always positive and less than 1.0.",
        "Step 7: Therefore, the load factor ($n$) sustained by the aircraft during a steady steep climb will be positive but less than 1.0."
