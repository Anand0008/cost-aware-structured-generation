      "reasoning": "The passage highlights a shift in modern warfare towards the suppression of civilian populations, for which 'chemical agents that do their work silently' are perceived as suitable. Crucially, the author uses the word 'regretfully' to express disapproval of the idea that people in military establishments consider chemical agents 'useful tools'. This indicates a strong negative sentiment regarding their use. Therefore, the statement that best sums up the meaning of the passage must reflect this undesirable aspect. Option C, 'Use of chemical agents in warfare would be undesirable,' accurately captures the author's implied stance and the negative connotation conveyed by 'regretfully' in the context of their use against civilians. Options A, B, and D either misinterpret the author's tone or focus on factual elements without conveying the underlying evaluative judgment."
