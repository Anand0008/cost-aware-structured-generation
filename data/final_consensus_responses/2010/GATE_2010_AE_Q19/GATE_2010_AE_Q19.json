      "reasoning": "In a multi-stage axial compressor, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is constant. A common design practice, known as the constant axial velocity design, maintains the axial component of the absolute velocity ($\\text{V}_x$) approximately constant across all stages. As air flows through the compressor, it is compressed, leading to a significant increase in its density ($\\rho$).\n\nThe mass flow rate equation is given by: $\\dot{m} = \\rho \\cdot A \\cdot \\text{V}_x$, where $A$ is the annular flow cross-sectional area.\n\nSince $\\dot{m}$ and $\\text{V}_x$ are constant, for the equation to hold, the product $\\rho \\cdot A$ must remain constant. Therefore, as $\\rho$ increases, $A$ must decrease.\n\nThe annular flow area $A$ can also be expressed as $A = \\pi (r_{\\text{tip}}^2 - r_{\\text{hub}}^2)$, where $r_{\\text{tip}}$ is the tip radius and $r_{\\text{hub}}$ is the hub radius. The blade height $h = r_{\\text{tip}} - r_{\\text{hub}}$.\n\nThe question states that the compressor has a 'constant diameter hub', meaning $r_{\\text{hub}}$ is constant. If $A$ decreases and $r_{\\text{hub}}$ is constant, then $r_{\\text{tip}}$ must decrease. Consequently, the blade height $h = r_{\\text{tip}} - r_{\\text{hub}}$ must also decrease in the flow direction."
