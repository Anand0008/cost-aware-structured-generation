The loading is biaxial tension, which is a plane stress state with no shear stress. Therefore, the applied stresses $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ are the principal stresses $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, with $\\sigma_3 = 0$.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Data:**\n    *   Uniaxial yield strength, $\\sigma_Y = 200 \\text{ MPa}$\n    *   Tensile stress in x-direction, $\\sigma_x = 150 \\text{ MPa}$\n    *   Tensile stress in y-direction, $\\sigma_y = ?$\n\n2.  **Apply Von Mises Yield Criterion for Plane Stress:**\n    For a plane stress state where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are the principal stresses and $\\sigma_3 = 0$, the Von Mises equivalent stress ($\\sigma_e$) is given by:\n    $\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}$\n    Yielding occurs when $\\sigma_e = \\sigma_Y$.\n\n3.  **Substitute Values:**\n    Let $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_x = 150 \\text{ MPa}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_y$.\n    $200 = \\sqrt{150^2 + \\sigma_y^2 - 150 \\cdot \\sigma_y}$\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\sigma_y$:**\n    Square both sides:\n    $200^2 = 150^2 + \\sigma_y^2 - 150 \\sigma_y$\n    $40000 = 22500 + \\sigma_y^2 - 150 \\sigma_y$\n    Rearrange into a quadratic equation:\n    $\\sigma_y^2 - 150 \\sigma_y + 22500 - 40000 = 0$\n    $\\sigma_y^2 - 150 \\sigma_y - 17500 = 0$\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, $\\sigma_y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{(-150)^2 - 4(1)(-17500)}}{2(1)}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{22500 + 70000}}{2}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{92500}}{2}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 \\pm 304.138}{2}$\n\n    Two possible solutions:\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 + 304.138}{2} = \\frac{454.138}{2} \\approx 227.069 \\text{ MPa}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 - 304.138}{2} = \\frac{-154.138}{2} \\approx -77.069 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Solution:**\n    The question asks for the 'maximum uniform tensile stress', so we choose the positive value.\n    $\\sigma_y \\approx 227 \\text{ MPa}$\n\nThis matches option A."

        "Identify the given information: The material is isotropic and follows the Von Mises (Distortion Energy) yield criterion. The uniaxial yield strength is $\\sigma_Y = 200 \\text{ MPa}$. The applied stress state is biaxial tension with $\\sigma_x = 150 \\text{ MPa}$ and an unknown tensile stress $\\sigma_y$ in the y-direction. There is no shear stress ($\\tau_{xy} = 0$).",
        "Recognize that this is a plane stress condition, meaning the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_x = 150 \\text{ MPa}$, $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_3 = 0$.",
        "Apply the Von Mises yield criterion for plane stress without shear, which states that yielding occurs when $\\sigma_x^2 - \\sigma_x \\sigma_y + \\sigma_y^2 = \\sigma_Y^2$.",
        "Substitute the known values into the equation: $(150)^2 - (150)(\\sigma_y) + (\\sigma_y)^2 = (200)^2$. This simplifies to $22500 - 150\\sigma_y + \\sigma_y^2 = 40000$.",
        "Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form: $\\sigma_y^2 - 150\\sigma_y - 17500 = 0$.",
        "Solve the quadratic equation for $\\sigma_y$ using the quadratic formula: $\\sigma_y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the coefficients ($a=1, b=-150, c=-17500$), we get $\\sigma_y = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{(-150)^2 - 4(1)(-17500)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{22500 + 70000}}{2} = \\frac{150 \\pm \\sqrt{92500}}{2}$.",

The two roots are $\\sigma_y \\approx (150 + 304.138)/2 \\approx 227.069 \\text{ MPa}$ and $\\sigma_y \\approx (150 - 304.138)/2 \\approx -77.069 \\text{ MPa}$.
