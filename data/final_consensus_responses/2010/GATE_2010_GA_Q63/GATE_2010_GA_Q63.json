      "reasoning": "To solve this work-rate problem, we first determine the individual work rate of each type of worker. The work rate is defined as the amount of work done per unit of time (in this case, per day).\n\n1.  **Calculate the work rate of one skilled worker:**\n    5 skilled workers build a wall in 20 days.\n    Total work done by 5 skilled workers in 1 day = 1/20 of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 skilled worker in 1 day = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 20} = \\frac{1}{100} of a wall per day.\n\n2.  **Calculate the work rate of one semi-skilled worker:**\n    8 semi-skilled workers build a wall in 25 days.\n    Total work done by 8 semi-skilled workers in 1 day = 1/25 of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 semi-skilled worker in 1 day = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 25} = \\frac{1}{200} of a wall per day.\n\n3.  **Calculate the work rate of one unskilled worker:**\n    10 unskilled workers build a wall in 30 days.\n    Total work done by 10 unskilled workers in 1 day = 1/30 of a wall.\n    Work done by 1 unskilled worker in 1 day = \\frac{1}{10 \\times 30} = \\frac{1}{300} of a wall per day.\n\n4.  **Calculate the combined work rate of the team:**\n    The team consists of 2 skilled, 6 semi-skilled, and 5 unskilled workers.\n    Work rate of 2 skilled workers = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{1}{50} of a wall per day.\n    Work rate of 6 semi-skilled workers = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{6}{200} = \\frac{3}{100} of a wall per day.\n    Work rate of 5 unskilled workers = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{5}{300} = \\frac{1}{60} of a wall per day.\n\n    Total work rate of the team = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{3}{100} + \\frac{1}{60} wall per day.\n\n    To sum these fractions, find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 50, 100, and 60. The LCM is 300.\n    Total work rate = \\frac{6}{300} + \\frac{9}{300} + \\frac{5}{300} = \\frac{6 + 9 + 5}{300} = \\frac{20}{300} = \\frac{1}{15} of a wall per day.\n\n5.  **Calculate the time taken to build the wall:**\n    If the team builds 1/15 of a wall per day, then the time taken to build 1 full wall is the reciprocal of the total work rate.\n    Time = \\frac{1}{\\text{Total Work Rate}} = \\frac{1}{1/15} = 15 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 days for the team to build the wall, which corresponds to option D."

        "description": "Instead of working with fractions, assume the total work is a certain number of 'units'. This total work is usually taken as the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the individual times taken by each worker or group. Then, calculate the 'units of work per day' for each worker type and sum them up to find the team's rate.",
        "name": "Total Work Units Method (LCM Method)",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Avoids fractional arithmetic until the very end, which can be less error-prone and faster for some students. Cons: Requires an extra step to define total work units, and numbers can become large if the LCM is big.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful when dealing with multiple groups or individuals with different completion times, especially if fractional arithmetic is a common source of error or if you are more comfortable with integer arithmetic."
