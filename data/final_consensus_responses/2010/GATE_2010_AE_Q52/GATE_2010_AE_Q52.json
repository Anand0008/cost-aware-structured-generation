      "reasoning": "For an ideal turbojet, the turbine work exactly equals the compressor work. Given Δh_c = 335 kJ/kg, turbine work per kg is -335 kJ/kg. Using C_p = 1117 J/kgK, the temperature drop across the isentropic turbine is ΔT_t = -335000/1117 ≈ -300 K, so T05 = T04 - 300 = 1100 K. With T04 = 1400 K, γ = 1.3, the isentropic relation P05/P04 = (T05/T04)^(γ/(γ-1)) gives P05 = 6 bar × (1100/1400)^(1.3/0.3) ≈ 2.11 bar, matching option C (2.1 bar)."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify Given Parameters and Principle. Given: $P_{03} = 6$ bar (turbine inlet stagnation pressure), $T_{03} = 1400$ K (turbine inlet stagnation temperature), $\\Delta h_c = 335$ kJ/kg (change in specific enthalpy across compressor), $C_p = 1117$ J/kgK, $\\gamma = 1.3$. Objective: Find $P_{04}$ (stagnation pressure at nozzle inlet, which is turbine exit). Principle: For an ideal turbojet, the work done by the turbine ($w_t$) is equal to the work consumed by the compressor ($w_c$). So, $w_t = \\Delta h_c$.",
        "Step 2: Calculate Turbine Work. The work done by the turbine per unit mass flow rate is $w_t = \\Delta h_c = 335$ kJ/kg.",
        "Step 3: Determine Stagnation Temperature at Turbine Exit ($T_{04}$). The turbine work can also be expressed as $w_t = C_p (T_{03} - T_{04})$. Substitute known values: $335 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J/kg} = 1117 \\text{ J/kgK} \\times (1400 \\text{ K} - T_{04})$. $1400 - T_{04} = \\frac{335000}{1117} \\approx 300$ K. Therefore, $T_{04} = 1400 - 300 = 1100$ K.",
        "Step 4: Apply Isentropic Relation for Turbine. For an ideal (isentropic) turbine, the stagnation pressure and temperature are related by: $\\frac{P_{04}}{P_{03}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{04}}{T_{03}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the Exponent. The exponent is $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1.3}{1.3-1} = \\frac{1.3}{0.3} = \\frac{13}{3} \\approx 4.3333$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate Stagnation Pressure at Nozzle Inlet ($P_{04}$). Substitute the values: $P_{04} = P_{03} \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{04}}{T_{03}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$. $P_{04} = 6 \\text{ bar} \\times \\left(\\frac{1100 \\text{ K}}{1400 \\text{ K}}\\right)^{13/3}$. $P_{04} = 6 \\text{ bar} \\times (0.7857)^{4.3333}$. $P_{04} = 6 \\text{ bar} \\times 0.3517 \\approx 2.1102$ bar.",
