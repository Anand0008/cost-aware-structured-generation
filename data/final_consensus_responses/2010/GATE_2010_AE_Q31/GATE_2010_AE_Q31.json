      "reasoning": "The section is a thin-walled open section symmetric about the x-axis. The centroidal x-axis is the horizontal axis through the mid-height of the web, and the given Ixx = \\frac{35}{12} t h^3 is about this axis. Due to symmetry about the x-axis, the shear center must lie on this axis at some x = -e (to the left of the web). To find its location, we apply a vertical shear force S_y through the unknown shear center at x = -e, which produces no net twisting. This means the total moment of internal shear flows about the shear center must be zero. For an open thin-walled section with one symmetry axis and S_x = 0, I_{xy} = 0, the shear flow is given by q_s = - \\frac{S_y}{I_{xx}} \\int_0^s t y \\, ds. Starting from the free edges of the flanges (where q = 0) and integrating along each flange and then the web, the horizontal flange shear flows form a couple. This internal couple's moment about the web must be balanced by the moment of the external shear force (S_y * e) about the web. Using the given Ixx and the geometry (each flange length = h/2, located at y = \\pm h/2), the integration for the resultant horizontal shear force in one flange leads to F_f = - \\frac{S_y t h^3}{8 I_{xx}}. The two flanges create a couple of magnitude 2 F_f \\cdot h/2 = \\frac{S_y t h^4}{8 I_{xx}}. Equating this internal couple to S_y e, and substituting I_{xx} = \\frac{35}{12} t h^3, we solve for e to get e = \\frac{9}{28} h. Since 'e' is the distance to the left of the web, the shear center is located at x_{SC} = - \\frac{9}{28} h, which matches option B.",
