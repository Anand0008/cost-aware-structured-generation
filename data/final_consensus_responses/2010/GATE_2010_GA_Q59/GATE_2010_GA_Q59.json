      "reasoning": "The sentence states, 'His rather casual remarks on politics _______ his lack of seriousness about the subject.' We need a word that implies the remarks *revealed* or *showed* his lack of seriousness.\n\nA. **Masked**: To mask means to hide or conceal. If his remarks masked his lack of seriousness, it would mean he was trying to hide his lack of seriousness, or that the remarks gave a false impression of seriousness. This contradicts the idea that the remarks *showed* his lack of seriousness.\nB. **Belied**: To belie means to contradict or give a false impression. If his remarks belied his lack of seriousness, it would imply that the remarks suggested he *was* serious, which is the opposite of what the sentence intends.\nC. **Betrayed**: To betray, in this context, means to reveal unintentionally or to show. If his casual remarks betrayed his lack of seriousness, it means the remarks inadvertently revealed or demonstrated that he was not serious about politics. This fits the sentence perfectly.\nD. **Suppressed**: To suppress means to hold back or prevent from being expressed. If his remarks suppressed his lack of seriousness, it would mean the remarks prevented his lack of seriousness from being shown, which is contrary to the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, 'betrayed' is the most appropriate word as it conveys that the casual remarks served as an unintentional revelation of his true attitude."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the sentence structure and the core meaning, identifying key elements like 'casual remarks' and 'lack of seriousness'. The sentence implies that the remarks revealed or indicated his lack of seriousness.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the meaning of each given option: (A) 'masked' means to hide or conceal. (B) 'belied' means to give a false impression, to show something to be untrue or to contradict. (C) 'betrayed' means to reveal unintentionally, to show signs of, or to be disloyal to. (D) 'suppressed' means to forcibly put an end to or prevent from being expressed.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate options based on context. 'Masked' and 'suppressed' are incorrect because they suggest hiding or preventing the lack of seriousness, which contradicts the idea that casual remarks would *show* it.",
        "Step 4: 'Belied' is incorrect because it implies the remarks would contradict his lack of seriousness (i.e., make him seem serious), which is not the case here; casual remarks are consistent with a lack of seriousness.",
        "Step 5: 'Betrayed' fits perfectly as it means the remarks unintentionally revealed or showed his true lack of seriousness.",
        "Step 6: Conclude that 'betrayed' is the most fitting word as it accurately conveys that the casual remarks served as an unintentional revelation of his lack of seriousness.",
