      "reasoning": "The absolute ceiling of an aircraft is the maximum altitude at which the aircraft can sustain level flight. At this altitude, the maximum power available from the engine exactly equals the minimum power required to maintain level flight, leaving no excess power for climb (i.e., the rate of climb becomes zero). Therefore, above the absolute ceiling, the aircraft cannot sustain level flight at a constant speed because the available power is insufficient to overcome drag and maintain its weight."

        "Apply the absolute ceiling condition: At the absolute ceiling, ROC = 0. This implies that the maximum power available (P_{\\text{available}}) exactly equals the power required (P_{\\text{required}}) for level flight. There is no excess power.",
        "Explain the implication: With no excess power, the aircraft cannot climb higher or accelerate.",
        "Describe conditions above the absolute ceiling: Above this altitude, the power required for level flight would exceed the maximum power available from the engine (P_{\\text{required}} > P_{\\text{available}}).",
