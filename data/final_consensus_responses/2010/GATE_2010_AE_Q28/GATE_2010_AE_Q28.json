      "reasoning": "The problem describes a uniform rigid rod of mass `m` and length `l` hinged at its upper end, oscillating as a physical pendulum. To find its natural frequency for small oscillations, we use the equation of motion for rotational dynamics.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** This is a physical pendulum, not a simple pendulum (where mass is concentrated at a point).\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (I) about the pivot:** For a uniform rod of mass `m` and length `l` rotating about an axis perpendicular to the rod and passing through one end (the hinge), the moment of inertia is given by `I = (1/3)ml^2`.\n3.  **Distance to the Center of Mass (h):** For a uniform rod, the center of mass (CM) is located at its geometric center, which is `l/2` from the hinge.\n4.  **Restoring Torque (M):** When the rod is displaced by a small angle `$\\theta$` from the vertical equilibrium position, the gravitational force `mg` acts at the CM. The restoring torque about the hinge is `M = - (mg) * h * sin(\\theta) = - (mg) * (l/2) * sin(\\theta)`. The negative sign indicates it's a restoring torque.\n5.  **Equation of Motion:** Applying Newton's second law for rotational motion, `$\\sum M = I \\ddot{\\theta}$`:\n    `$I \\ddot{\\theta} = - (mg) (l/2) sin(\\theta)$`\n    `$(1/3)ml^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + (mg) (l/2) sin(\\theta) = 0$`\n6.  **Linearization for Small Oscillations:** For small angles, `$\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$` (in radians).\n    `$(1/3)ml^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + (mg) (l/2) \\theta = 0$`\n7.  **Standard Form of SHM Equation:** Divide the entire equation by `$(1/3)ml^2$` to get it into the form `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\omega_n^2 \\theta = 0$`:\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{(mg)(l/2)}{(1/3)ml^2} \\theta = 0$`\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{3mg l}{2ml^2} \\theta = 0$`\n    `$\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{3g}{2l} \\theta = 0$`\n8.  **Natural Angular Frequency ($\\omega_n$):** From the standard form, `$\\omega_n^2 = \\frac{3g}{2l}$`.\n    Therefore, the natural angular frequency is `$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{3g}{2l}}$`.\n\nThis matches option D."

For a physical pendulum, $T = (1/2)I \\dot{\\theta}^2$ and $V = mgh(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$. For small angles, $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$, simplifying $V \\approx (1/2)mgd\\theta^2$. The equation of motion can be derived using Lagrange's equation: $\\frac{d}{dt} (\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}) - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, or by differentiating the total energy $E = T + V = \\text{constant}$ with respect to time, leading to $I\\ddot{\\theta} + mgd\\theta = 0$, from which $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{mgd/I}$.",

Cons: Requires understanding of Lagrangian mechanics and energy formulations, which might be more advanced. Can be slightly longer than direct application of Newton's Second Law for simple cases.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for systems with multiple degrees of freedom, complex geometry, or constraints where direct force/torque analysis is cumbersome. Also valuable for providing additional insight into physical behavior, or for verifying derivations and formulas."
