      "reasoning": "The problem describes a simply supported beam of length L with a square cross-section of dimension `h x h`. A bracket is welded at its center, carrying a vertical load P. The bracket dimension `a = 0.1L` indicates an eccentric load.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Loading**: The vertical load P, applied at a distance `a` from the beam's centerline at `L/2`, creates two effects on the beam at its center: a downward vertical force `P` and a clockwise moment `M = P \\times a = P \\times 0.1L`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Support Reactions**: For a simply supported beam with a central point load P and a central moment M, the reactions can be found by superposition:\n    *   `R_A = P/2 - M/L = 0.5P - (P \\times 0.1L)/L = 0.5P - 0.1P = 0.4P` (upward)\n    *   `R_B = P/2 + M/L = 0.5P + (P \\times 0.1L)/L = 0.5P + 0.1P = 0.6P` (upward)\n\n3.  **Determine Maximum Shear Force (V_max)**:\n    *   The shear force `V` from the left support (A) to the center (just before the load) is `V = R_A = 0.4P`.\n    *   At the center, there is a downward force `P`. So, the shear force drops by `P`.\n    *   The shear force `V` from the center (just after the load) to the right support (B) is `V = R_A - P = 0.4P - P = -0.6P`.\n    *   The maximum absolute shear force in the beam is `V_{max} = |-0.6P| = 0.6P`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Maximum Shear Stress ($\\tau_{max}$)**:\n    *   The beam has a square cross-section of dimension `h x h`. Therefore, the cross-sectional area `A = h \\times h = h^2`.\n    *   For a solid rectangular cross-section, the maximum shear stress occurs at the neutral axis and is given by the formula: `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V_{max}}{A}$`.\n    *   Substitute the values of `V_{max}` and `A`:\n        `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{0.6P}{h^2}$`\n        `$\\tau_{max} = 1.5 \\times 0.6 \\frac{P}{h^2}$`\n        `$\\tau_{max} = 0.9 \\frac{P}{h^2}$`\n\nThis result matches Option D."

        "description": "Directly apply the general shear stress formula `$\\tau = \\frac{VQ}{Ib}$`. Here, $Q$ is the first moment of area of the section above (or below) the point where shear stress is calculated, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the entire cross-section about the neutral axis, and $b$ is the width of the section at that point. For a rectangular section, $Q$ is maximum at the neutral axis, leading to $\\tau_{max}$.",
