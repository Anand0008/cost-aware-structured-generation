By comparing, we identify the maximum circulation at the wing root Gamma_0 = 100 m^2/s and the wingspan b = 4 m. The free stream velocity is given as V_infinity = 100 m/s. For an elliptical circulation distribution, the induced downwash (w) is constant across the entire span and is given by the formula: w = Gamma_0 / (2b). Substituting the values, w = 100 / (2 * 4) = 12.5 m/s. The induced angle of attack (alpha_i) is defined as the ratio of the induced downwash to the free stream velocity: alpha_i = w / V_infinity. Substituting the calculated downwash and free stream velocity, alpha_i = 12.5 / 100 = 0.125 radians. The induced angle of attack is constant across the span for an elliptical distribution. The sign is positive, as induced angle is typically considered a magnitude in such problems."
