        "Step 1: Understand the trim condition. For an aircraft to be in trimmed flight (longitudinal equilibrium, e.g., steady, level flight), the net pitching moment about its center of gravity must be zero ($C_{m,cg} = 0$). This is the fundamental condition for trim.",
        "Step 2: Write down the given pitching moment coefficient equation and apply the trim condition. The given equation is $C_{m,cg} = (0.05 - 0.2 \\delta_e) - 0.1 C_L$. For trim, set $C_{m,cg} = 0$, so $0 = (0.05 - 0.2 \\delta_e) - 0.1 C_L$.",
        "Step 3: Solve the equation for elevator deflection ($\\delta_e$) in terms of lift coefficient ($C_L$). Rearranging the equation from Step 2: $0.05 - 0.2 \\delta_e - 0.1 C_L = 0 \\implies -0.2 \\delta_e = 0.1 C_L - 0.05 \\implies \\delta_e = \\frac{0.05 - 0.1 C_L}{0.2}$.",
        "Step 4: Simplify the expression for $\\delta_e$: $\\delta_e = \\frac{0.05}{0.2} - \\frac{0.1 C_L}{0.2} \\implies \\delta_e = 0.25 - 0.5 C_L$. This equation gives the elevator deflection required for trim for any given $C_L$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the initial elevator deflection ($\\delta_{e1}$) for the initial lift coefficient $C_{L1} = 0.4$: $\\delta_{e1} = 0.25 - 0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05$ radians.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the final elevator deflection ($\\delta_{e2}$) for the final lift coefficient $C_{L2} = 0.9$: $\\delta_{e2} = 0.25 - 0.5 \\times 0.9 = 0.25 - 0.45 = -0.20$ radians.",
        "Step 7: Determine the change in elevator deflection ($\\Delta \\delta_e$) required: $\\Delta \\delta_e = \\delta_{e2} - \\delta_{e1} = (-0.20) - (0.05) = -0.25$ radians.",
        "Step 8: Interpret the result. A negative change in elevator deflection ($\\Delta \\delta_e = -0.25$ radians) means the elevator must be deflected upward (or to a more negative angle) to achieve the new trim condition with a higher lift coefficient. This is consistent with increasing lift often requiring a nose-up moment from the tail, which an upward elevator deflection provides."

      "Control Systems": "The concept of trim is analogous to setting a 'setpoint' or 'equilibrium' in control systems, specifically by setting the error signal to zero in a feedback control loop to maintain a desired output (e.g., altitude hold). Elevator deflection acts as a control input to achieve this equilibrium, and the derivatives in the moment equation are akin to system gains."
