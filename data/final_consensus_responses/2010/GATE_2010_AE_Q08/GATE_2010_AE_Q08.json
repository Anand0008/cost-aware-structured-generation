      "reasoning": "In straight and level flight, stall speed V_s0 = 40 m/s. For a level turn with bank angle φ=60°, the load factor (n) is calculated as n = 1/cos(φ). Substituting φ=60°, we get n = 1/cos(60°) = 1/0.5 = 2. The stall speed in turning flight (V_stall,turn) increases by the factor √n relative to the straight and level stall speed (V_s0). So, V_stall,turn = V_s0 * √n = 40 * √2 ≈ 56.568 m/s. This value is approximately 56.6 m/s, which matches option C."
