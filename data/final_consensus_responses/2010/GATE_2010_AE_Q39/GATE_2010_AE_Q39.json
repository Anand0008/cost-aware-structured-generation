      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the mass flow rate through a choked converging-diverging nozzle. The condition 'supersonic at the exit' implies that the nozzle throat is choked (Mach number M=1). For isentropic flow through a choked nozzle, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) can be calculated using the formula: $\\dot{m} = A_t \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2(\\gamma-1)}}$. Substituting the given values: $P_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^6$ Pa, $T_0 = 2500$ K, $\\gamma = 1.2$, $R = 692.83$ J/kgK, and $A_t = 0.025$ m$^2$. The calculation yields $\\dot{m} \\approx 18.477$ kg/s, which rounds to 18.5 kg/s, matching option A."

        "Compute the stagnation term: $\\frac{P_0 A_t}{\\sqrt{T_0}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^6 \\times 0.025}{\\sqrt{2500}} = \\frac{37500}{50} = 750$.",
