      "reasoning": "The problem states `137 + 276 = 435`. Performing standard decimal addition, `137 + 276 = 413`. Since `413 \\neq 435`, the numbers are not being added in base 10. This suggests that the numbers are represented in a different number base.\n\nLet's assume the numbers are in an unknown base `B`. We can set up an algebraic equation by converting the numbers to base 10:\n`(1 \\cdot B^2 + 3 \\cdot B^1 + 7 \\cdot B^0) + (2 \\cdot B^2 + 7 \\cdot B^1 + 6 \\cdot B^0) = (4 \\cdot B^2 + 3 \\cdot B^1 + 5 \\cdot B^0)`\n`(B^2 + 3B + 7) + (2B^2 + 7B + 6) = (4B^2 + 3B + 5)`\n`3B^2 + 10B + 13 = 4B^2 + 3B + 5`\nRearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation:\n`0 = 4B^2 - 3B^2 + 3B - 10B + 5 - 13`\n`0 = B^2 - 7B - 8`\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n`(B - 8)(B + 1) = 0`\nSince a number base must be a positive integer, `B = 8`. This means the given operation is addition in base 8.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the second expression: `731 + 672`. We perform addition in base 8:\n\n  `731_8`\n+ `672_8`\n-------\n\n1.  **Units digit**: `1_8 + 2_8 = 3_8` (No carry, as 3 < 8)\n2.  **Eights digit**: `3_8 + 7_8 = 10_{10}`. In base 8, `10_{10}` is represented as `1 \\times 8^1 + 2 \\times 8^0 = 12_8`. So, we write down `2` and carry over `1` to the next place value.\n3.  **Sixty-fours digit**: `7_8 + 6_8 + 1_8` (carry) `= 14_{10}`. In base 8, `14_{10}` is represented as `1 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0 = 16_8`. So, we write down `6` and carry over `1` to the next place value.\n4.  **Two-hundred-fifty-sixes digit**: `0_8 + 0_8 + 1_8` (carry) `= 1_8`.\n\nCombining the digits, the sum is `1623_8`.\n\nTo verify, convert `1623_8` to base 10:\n`1623_8 = 1 \\cdot 8^3 + 6 \\cdot 8^2 + 2 \\cdot 8^1 + 3 \\cdot 8^0 = 1 \\cdot 512 + 6 \\cdot 64 + 2 \\cdot 8 + 3 \\cdot 1 = 512 + 384 + 16 + 3 = 915_{10}`\n\nAlso, `731_8 = 7 \\cdot 8^2 + 3 \\cdot 8^1 + 1 \\cdot 8^0 = 448 + 24 + 1 = 473_{10}` and `672_8 = 6 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8^1 + 2 \\cdot 8^0 = 384 + 56 + 2 = 442_{10}`. Their sum is `473_{10} + 442_{10} = 915_{10}`. The base 8 addition is consistent.\n\nTherefore, `731 + 672 = 1623` in this context."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Recognize that the given addition (137 + 276 = 435) is not valid in base 10 (since 137 + 276 = 413 in base 10). This suggests the numbers are in a different base, say base b.",
        "Step 2: Let the unknown base be 'b'. Write the place-value expansion for each number in base b: $(1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b + 7) + (2 \\cdot b^2 + 7 \\cdot b + 6) = (4 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b + 5)$.",
        "Step 3: Simplify the equation: $3b^2 + 10b + 13 = 4b^2 + 3b + 5 \\implies b^2 - 7b - 8 = 0$.",
        "Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation: $(b-8)(b+1)=0$. This yields $b=8$ or $b=-1$. Since a number base must be positive, the valid base is $b=8$. Thus, the numbers are in base 8 (octal).",
        "Step 5: Now, compute $731_8 + 672_8$ in base 8. Perform digit-by-digit addition from right to left, considering carries in base 8:\n    *   Units digit: $1_8 + 2_8 = 3_8$.\n    *   Eights digit: $3_8 + 7_8 = 10_{10} = 12_8$. Write 2, carry 1.\n    *   Sixty-fours digit: $7_8 + 6_8 + 1_8$ (carry) $= 14_{10} = 16_8$. Write 6, carry 1.\n    *   Final carry: $1_8$.\n    The result is $1623_8$.",
        "Step 6: (Optional Verification) Convert the numbers and sum to decimal: $731_8 = 7 \\cdot 8^2 + 3 \\cdot 8^1 + 1 \\cdot 8^0 = 448 + 24 + 1 = 473_{10}$. $672_8 = 6 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8^1 + 2 \\cdot 8^0 = 384 + 56 + 2 = 442_{10}$. The sum is $473_{10} + 442_{10} = 915_{10}$. Convert $915_{10}$ to base 8: $915 \\div 8 = 114$ R $3$, $114 \\div 8 = 14$ R $2$, $14 \\div 8 = 1$ R $6$, $1 \\div 8 = 0$ R $1$. Reading remainders upwards gives $1623_8$. This matches the calculated result."
