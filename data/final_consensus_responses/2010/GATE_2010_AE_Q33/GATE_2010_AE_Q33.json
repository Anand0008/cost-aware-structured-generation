We need to find the Laplace transform of `y_1(t) = e^t (2 \\cos 2t - \\sin 2t)`. This can be solved using the First Shifting Theorem of Laplace transforms.\n\nLet `f(t) = 2 \\cos 2t - \\sin 2t`.\nWe are given `L\\{e^{-t} f(t)\\} = 2s / ((s+1)^2 + 4)`.\nAccording to the First Shifting Theorem, if `L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s)`, then `L\\{e^{at} f(t)\\} = F(s-a)`.\n\nFrom the given information, `L\\{e^{-t} f(t)\\} = F(s - (-1)) = F(s+1) = 2s / ((s+1)^2 + 4)`.\n\nTo find `F(s)`, we can substitute `(s-1)` for `s` in the expression for `F(s+1)`:\nLet `s' = s+1`. Then `s = s' - 1`.\nSo, `F(s') = 2(s' - 1) / (s'^2 + 4)`.\nReplacing `s'` with `s`, we get `F(s) = 2(s - 1) / (s^2 + 4)`.\n\nNow, we need to find `L\\{e^t f(t)\\}`, which is `F(s-1)` according to the First Shifting Theorem (with `a=1`).\nSubstitute `(s-1)` for `s` in the expression for `F(s)`:\n`F(s-1) = 2((s-1) - 1) / (((s-1))^2 + 4)`\n`F(s-1) = 2(s - 2) / ((s-1)^2 + 4)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. `2(s-2)/((s-1)^2+4)` - This matches our derived result.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
