        "Step 1: Understand the problem. The system is an underdamped Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system, where peak amplitudes decay exponentially. The third peak amplitude is 100 and the tenth peak amplitude is 10. The goal is to find the damping ratio ($\\zeta$) using the logarithmic decrement method.",
        "Step 2: Determine the number of cycles ($n$) between the given peaks. The third peak ($u_3 = 100$) and the tenth peak ($u_{10} = 10$) are separated by $n = 10 - 3 = 7$ cycles.",
        "Step 3: Apply the logarithmic decrement formula for $n$ cycles: $\\delta = \\frac{1}{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{u_m}{u_{m+n}}\\right)$. Substitute $n=7$, $u_m=u_3=100$, and $u_{m+n}=u_{10}=10$. So, $\\delta = \\frac{1}{7} \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{10}\\right) = \\frac{1}{7} \\ln(10)$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the value of $\\delta$: $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$. Therefore, $\\delta \\approx \\frac{2.302585}{7} \\approx 0.32894$.",
        "Step 5: Relate the logarithmic decrement ($\\delta$) to the damping ratio ($\\zeta$). The exact relationship for an underdamped system is $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$. For small damping ratios ($\\zeta < 0.1$), the approximation $\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\approx 1$ can be used, simplifying the relation to $\\delta \\approx 2\\pi\\zeta$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the damping ratio ($\\zeta$). Using the small damping approximation, $\\zeta \\approx \\frac{\\delta}{2\\pi}$. Substitute the calculated $\\delta \\approx 0.32894$: $\\zeta \\approx \\frac{0.32894}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{0.32894}{6.283185} \\approx 0.05235$. This value is approximately 0.052.",
        "Step 7: (Optional) Verify the result using the exact formula for $\\zeta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\pi^2 + \\delta^2}}$. Substituting $\\delta \\approx 0.32894$: $\\zeta = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.32894)^2}{4\\pi^2 + (0.32894)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.10820}{39.4784 + 0.10820}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.10820}{39.5866}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.002733} \\approx 0.05227$.
