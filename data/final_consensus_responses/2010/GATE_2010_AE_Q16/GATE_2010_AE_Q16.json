For this boundary condition, the effective length factor (K) is $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$. The corresponding critical buckling load would be $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(0.707 L)^2}$. However, the provided correct answer (D) corresponds to the formula $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(2 L)^2}$, which is applicable for a column with one end fixed and the other end **free** (cantilever), where K=2. Therefore, there is a significant discrepancy between the question's stated boundary conditions and the formula implied by the correct answer.

This factor corresponds to a fixed-free (cantilever) column. Therefore, either the question's description of 'hinged' is incorrect, or the provided answer key assumes a fixed-free condition."
