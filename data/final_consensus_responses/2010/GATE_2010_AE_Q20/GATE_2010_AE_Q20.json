      "reasoning": "The correct answer is B, `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\gg \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$`. This is a fundamental characteristic of a thin laminar boundary layer, based on Prandtl's boundary layer approximations. The boundary layer thickness `$\\delta$` is much smaller than the characteristic streamwise length `x` (i.e., `$\\delta \\ll x$`). Consequently, the streamwise velocity `u` changes much more rapidly in the wall-normal direction `y` (across the thin boundary layer, from 0 at the wall to the free-stream velocity at the edge) than it does in the streamwise direction `x` (along the flow). This leads to the wall-normal velocity gradient `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$` being significantly larger than the streamwise velocity gradient `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$`. This scaling is a cornerstone assumption for simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations into the boundary-layer equations."

        "Identify the flow regime as a 2-D, steady, fully developed, laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. This implies a zero pressure gradient and a self-similar velocity profile.",
        "Recall the fundamental assumption of boundary layer theory: the boundary layer thickness `$\\delta$` is much smaller than the characteristic streamwise length `x` (i.e., `$\\delta \\ll x$`). This means the flow changes much more rapidly in the wall-normal direction than in the streamwise direction.",
        "Apply scaling analysis to estimate the order of magnitude of the velocity gradients. The streamwise velocity `u` changes from 0 at the wall to `U_e` (free-stream velocity) at the edge of the boundary layer over a distance `$\\delta$`. Along the plate, it changes over a characteristic length `x` (or `L`).",
        "Estimate the order of magnitude for the wall-normal velocity gradient as `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\sim \\frac{U_e}{\\delta}$` and the streamwise velocity gradient as `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{U_e}{x}$` (or `$\\frac{U_e}{L}$`).",
        "Since `$\\delta \\ll x$` (or `$\\delta \\ll L$`), it implies that `$\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\gg \\frac{1}{x}$`. Therefore, `$\\frac{U_e}{\\delta} \\gg \\frac{U_e}{x}$`, which directly leads to the conclusion that `$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\gg \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$`.",
