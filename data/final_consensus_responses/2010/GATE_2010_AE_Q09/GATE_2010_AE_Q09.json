A Hermitian matrix is defined as a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose ($A = A^*$). For a real matrix, the conjugate transpose $A^*$ simplifies to the transpose $A^T$. Therefore, if a matrix is real and symmetric ($A = A^T$), it satisfies the condition for being Hermitian ($A = A^*$). A fundamental property of Hermitian matrices is that all their eigenvalues are real numbers. Consequently, since real symmetric matrices are Hermitian, their eigenvalues must always be real."
