      "reasoning": "The problem requires the application of the Breguet Range Equation for propeller-driven aircraft, which relates the range (R) to the initial and final weights of the aircraft, assuming constant propulsive efficiency (η), specific fuel consumption (c_p), and maximum lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) for maximum range flight.\n\nThe Breguet Range Equation for propeller aircraft is:\n$R = \\frac{\\eta}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)_{max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\\right)$\nLet $K = \\frac{\\eta}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)_{max}$ be a constant for a given aircraft flying at maximum range conditions. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\\right)$\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nThe aircraft consumes 20% of its take-off weight ($W_{TO}$) as fuel. The distance traveled is R.\nInitial weight, $W_{initial,1} = W_{TO}$.\nFinal weight, $W_{final,1} = W_{TO} - 0.20 \\cdot W_{TO} = 0.80 \\cdot W_{TO}$.\nSubstituting these into the Breguet equation:\n$R = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{TO}}{0.80 \\cdot W_{TO}}\\right) = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.80}\\right) = K \\ln(1.25)$ (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nThe aircraft continues to fly and consumes a total of 50% of its take-off weight ($W_{TO}$) as fuel. The new distance traveled is $R'$.\nInitial weight, $W_{initial,2} = W_{TO}$.\nFinal weight, $W_{final,2} = W_{TO} - 0.50 \\cdot W_{TO} = 0.50 \\cdot W_{TO}$.\nSubstituting these into the Breguet equation:\n$R' = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{TO}}{0.50 \\cdot W_{TO}}\\right) = K \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.50}\\right) = K \\ln(2)$ (Equation 2)\n\nTo find $R'$ in terms of $R$, divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n$\\frac{R'}{R} = \\frac{K \\ln(2)}{K \\ln(1.25)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.25)}$\n\nUsing numerical values for natural logarithms:\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$\n$\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.223144$\n\n$\\frac{R'}{R} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.223144} \\approx 3.1066$\n\nTherefore, $R' \\approx 3.1066 \\cdot R$.\nThe closest option among the choices is B, which is 3.1 R."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. For a propeller aircraft flying at maximum range, the distance is given by the Breguet range equation: $R = \\frac{\\eta}{C_p} \\frac{L}{D} \\ln \\left( \\frac{W_0}{W_1} \\right)$. The condition 'trimmed to attain maximum range' implies that the aerodynamic efficiency (L/D) and engine parameters (propulsive efficiency $\\eta$ and power-specific fuel consumption $c_p$) are constant and optimized.",
        "Step 2: Define variables and constant terms. Let $W_0$ be the take-off weight. The factor $k = \\frac{\\eta}{C_p} \\frac{L}{D}$ is constant for the flight under maximum range conditions.",
        "Step 3: Apply the equation to the first scenario. The aircraft consumes 20% of its take-off weight as fuel. So, the final weight $W_1 = W_0 - 0.2W_0 = 0.8W_0$. The distance covered is $R = k \\ln \\left( \\frac{W_0}{0.8W_0} \\right) = k \\ln(1.25)$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the equation to the second scenario. The aircraft consumes a total of 50% of its take-off weight as fuel. So, the final weight $W_2 = W_0 - 0.5W_0 = 0.5W_0$. The total distance from take-off is $R_{total} = k \\ln \\left( \\frac{W_0}{0.5W_0} \\right) = k \\ln(2)$.",
        "Step 5: Form the ratio of the two ranges. Divide the equation for $R_{total}$ by the equation for $R$ to eliminate the constant $k$: $\\frac{R_{total}}{R} = \\frac{k \\ln(2)}{k \\ln(1.25)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.25)}$.",
        "Step 6: Compute the numerical value. $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.223144$. Therefore, $\\frac{R_{total}}{R} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.223144} \\approx 3.1066$.",
        "Step 7: State the final answer. The distance from the take-off point after burning 50% of the take-off weight as fuel is approximately $3.1R$."
