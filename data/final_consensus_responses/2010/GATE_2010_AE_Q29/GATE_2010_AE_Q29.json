      "reasoning": "For an Airy stress function \\(\\phi(x,y)\\), the plane stress components are defined as:\n\\(\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2}\\)\n\\(\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}\\)\n\\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\)\n\nThe problem states the plate is subjected to uniform shear \\(\\tau_0\\) along all edges and uniform uniaxial tension \\(\\sigma_0\\) in the y-direction. This implies the desired stress state is:\n\\(\\sigma_x = 0\\)\n\\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\) (constant tension)\n\\(\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_0\\) (constant shear)\n\nLet's test Option C: \\(\\phi = -\\tau_0 xy + \\sigma_0 \\frac{x^2}{2}\\)\n\n1.  **Calculate \\(\\sigma_x\\):**\n    \\(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = -\\tau_0 x\\)\n    \\(\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\tau_0 x) = 0\\). This matches the requirement \\(\\sigma_x = 0\\).\n\n2.  **Calculate \\(\\sigma_y\\):**\n    \\(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = -\\tau_0 y + \\sigma_0 x\\)\n    \\(\\sigma_y = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\tau_0 y + \\sigma_0 x) = \\sigma_0\\). This matches the requirement \\(\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0\\).\n\n3.  **Calculate \\(\\tau_{xy}\\):**\n    \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\tau_0 x) = -(-\\tau_0) = \\tau_0\\). This matches the requirement \\(\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_0\\).\n\nAdditionally, for a valid Airy's stress function in the absence of body forces, it must satisfy the biharmonic equation \\(\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0\\). For the given \\(\\phi\\), all fourth-order partial derivatives are zero, so the compatibility condition is satisfied.\n\nComparing with other options:\n*   Options B and D have \\(+\\tau_0 xy\\), which would result in \\(\\tau_{xy} = -\\tau_0\\), opposite to the applied shear.\n*   Option A has \\(-\\sigma_0 x^2/2\\), which would give \\(\\sigma_y = -\\sigma_0\\) (compression) instead of tension. Also, options A and D include higher-order terms like \\(x^4 - y^4\\) which would produce non-uniform stresses, contradicting the uniform traction condition.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the appropriate Airy's stress function that satisfies all given loading conditions and compatibility."

        "description": "Instead of starting with an Airy's function and deriving stresses, one could start with the equilibrium equations ($\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y}{\\partial y} = 0$) and the compatibility equation, and try to integrate them to find the stress components directly. Once stresses are known, an Airy's function can be constructed.",
