      "reasoning": "The problem requires a systematic application of the given conditions to determine the correct birth order. Let the siblings be H, G, I, S. Let their ages from oldest to youngest be $A_1 > A_2 > A_3 > A_4$. Since there are no twins and the age difference between successive siblings is less than 3 years, the age difference between any two successive siblings must be either 1 or 2 years (i.e., $A_i - A_{i+1} \\in \\{1, 2\\}$). \n\n**Condition 1:** Hari's age + Gita's age > Irfan's age + Saira's age (H + G > I + S).\n**Condition 2:** The age difference between Gita and Saira is 1 year. This means G and S are adjacent in the birth order.\n**Condition 3:** Gita is not the oldest ($G \\ne A_1$), and Saira is not the youngest ($S \\ne A_4$).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n**Option A: HSIG (H > S > I > G)**\n*   Condition 2: S and G are not adjacent (I is between them). This option is immediately incorrect.\n\n**Option B: SGHI (S > G > H > I)**\n*   Condition 2: S and G are adjacent. (Satisfied)\n*   Condition 3: G is not the oldest (G is $A_2$). S is not the youngest (S is $A_1$). (Satisfied)\n*   Now, apply Condition 1 (H + G > I + S). Let I's age be $x$. Since $A_i - A_{i+1} \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, let the age differences be $k_1, k_2, k_3 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    *   I's age = $x$\n    *   H's age = $x + k_1$\n    *   G's age = $x + k_1 + k_2$\n    *   S's age = $x + k_1 + k_2 + k_3$\n*   From Condition 2, since S and G are adjacent and S > G, the age difference $S - G$ must be 1. Thus, $k_3 = 1$.\n    *   S's age = $x + k_1 + k_2 + 1$\n    *   G's age = $x + k_1 + k_2$\n    *   H's age = $x + k_1$\n    *   I's age = $x$\n*   Substitute these into the inequality $H + G > I + S$:\n    $(x + k_1) + (x + k_1 + k_2) > x + (x + k_1 + k_2 + 1)$\n    $2x + 2k_1 + k_2 > 2x + k_1 + k_2 + 1$\n    $2k_1 > k_1 + 1$\n    $k_1 > 1$\n*   Since $k_1 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, the only possible value for $k_1$ is 2.

(Satisfied)\n*   Condition 3: G is not the oldest (G is $A_2$). S is not the youngest (S is $A_3$). (Satisfied)\n*   Apply Condition 1 (H + G > I + S).

Thus, $k_2 = 1$.\n    *   I's age = $x + k_1 + 1 + k_3$\n    *   G's age = $x + k_1 + 1$\n    *   S's age = $x + k_1$\n    *   H's age = $x$\n*   Substitute these into the inequality $H + G > I + S$:\n    $x + (x + k_1 + 1) > (x + k_1 + 1 + k_3) + (x + k_1)$\n    $2x + k_1 + 1 > 2x + 2k_1 + 1 + k_3$\n    $0 > k_1 + k_3$\n*   This is impossible, as $k_1, k_3 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, so their sum must be positive. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: IHSG (I > H > S > G)**\n*   Condition 2: S and G are adjacent. (Satisfied)\n*   Condition 3: G is not the oldest (G is $A_4$).
