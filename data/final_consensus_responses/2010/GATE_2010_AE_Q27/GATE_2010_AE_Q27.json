Check Equilibrium Equations:**\nFor a 2D problem with no body forces, the equilibrium equations are:\n   a. `$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} = 0$`\n   b. `$\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y}{\\partial y} = 0$`\n\nGiven stresses:\n   `$\\sigma_x = 3x^2y + 4y^2$`\n   `$\\sigma_y = y^3 + 14xy$`\n   `$\\tau_{xy} = -3xy^2 - 7x^2$`\n\nCalculate the required partial derivatives:\n   `$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^2y + 4y^2) = 6xy$`\n   `$\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-3xy^2 - 7x^2) = -6xy$`\n\nSubstitute into equation (a):\n   `$6xy + (-6xy) = 0 \\implies 0 = 0$`\n   Equation (a) is satisfied.\n\n   `$\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-3xy^2 - 7x^2) = -3y^2 - 14x$`\n   `$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^3 + 14xy) = 3y^2 + 14x$`\n\nSubstitute into equation (b):\n   `$(-3y^2 - 14x) + (3y^2 + 14x) = 0 \\implies 0 = 0$`\n   Equation (b) is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion for Equilibrium:** The proposed stress state satisfies both equilibrium equations.\n\n**2. Check Compatibility Equation:**\nFor a 2D problem with no body forces, the compatibility equation in terms of stresses is:\n   `$\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right) (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) = 0$`\n   This can be written as `$\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial y^2} = 0$`\n\nFirst, find the sum `$(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`:\n   `$\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y = (3x^2y + 4y^2) + (y^3 + 14xy) = 3x^2y + 4y^2 + y^3 + 14xy$`\n\nCalculate the second partial derivatives of `$(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)$`:\n   `$\\frac{\\partial (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^2y + 4y^2 + y^3 + 14xy) = 6xy + 14y$`\n   `$\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(6xy + 14y) = 6y$`\n\n   `$\\frac{\\partial (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2y + 4y^2 + y^3 + 14xy) = 3x^2 + 8y + 3y^2 + 14x$`\n   `$\\frac{\\partial^2 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2 + 8y + 3y^2 + 14x) = 8 + 6y$`\n\nSubstitute these into the compatibility equation:\n   `$6y + (8 + 6y) = 0$`\n   `$12y + 8 = 0$`\n\nThis equation `$(12y + 8 = 0)$` is not generally satisfied for all values of `x` and `y` in the domain. Therefore, the compatibility equation is NOT satisfied.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The proposed stress state satisfies the equilibrium equations but not the compatibility equation. This corresponds to option A."
