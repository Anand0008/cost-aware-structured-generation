      "reasoning": "The problem involves a simply supported beam with a vertical load P applied via a bracket at its center. The bracket extends horizontally by a distance 'a' (where `a = 0.1L`). This configuration introduces two effects at the beam's center (`x = L/2`):\n1.  A downward vertical force `P`.\n2.  A concentrated clockwise moment `M_c = P \\times a = P \\times 0.1L = 0.1PL`.\n\nWe can use the principle of superposition to determine the Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):\n\n**Part 1: Simply Supported Beam with Point Load `P` at `L/2`**\n*   Reactions: `R_A1 = R_B1 = P/2` (upwards).\n*   Bending Moment: `M_1(x) = (P/2)x` for `0 \\le x \\le L/2`.\n    *   `M_1(L/2) = (P/2)(L/2) = PL/4 = 0.25PL`.\n*   `M_1(x) = (P/2)x - P(x - L/2) = P(L-x)/2` for `L/2 < x \\le L`.\n\n**Part 2: Simply Supported Beam with Clockwise Concentrated Moment `M_c = 0.1PL` at `L/2`**\n*   Reactions: To balance the clockwise moment, `R_A2` must be downwards and `R_B2` upwards.\n    *   `\\Sigma M_A = 0 \\implies R_{B2} \\times L - M_c = 0 \\implies R_{B2} = M_c / L = 0.1PL / L = 0.1P` (upwards).\n    *   `\\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies R_{A2} + R_{B2} = 0 \\implies R_{A2} = -0.1P` (downwards).\n*   Bending Moment:\n    *   For `0 \\le x < L/2`: `M_2(x) = R_{A2} \\times x = -0.1P \\times x`.\n        *   `M_2(L/2)_{\\text{left}} = -0.1P(L/2) = -0.05PL`.\n    *   At `x = L/2`, a clockwise concentrated moment `M_c` causes a positive jump in the BMD (using the convention where positive moment is sagging and a clockwise external moment causes a positive jump in the BMD when moving left to right).\n        *   `M_2(L/2)_{\\text{right}} = M_2(L/2)_{\\text{left}} + M_c = -0.05PL + 0.1PL = 0.05PL`.\n    *   For `L/2 < x \\le L`: `M_2(x)` can be found by taking moments from the right end.\n        *   `M_2(x) = R_{B2} \\times (L-x) = 0.1P(L-x)`.\n\n**Combined Bending Moment Diagram (`M(x) = M_1(x) + M_2(x)`)**\n*   **For `0 \\le x < L/2`:**\n    *   `M(x) = 0.5Px - 0.1Px = 0.4Px`.\n    *   At `x=0`, `M(0) = 0`.\n    *   At `x=L/2` (left of center), `M(L/2)_{\\text{left}} = 0.4P(L/2) = 0.2PL`.\n*   **For `L/2 < x \\le L`:**\n    *   `M(x) = 0.5P(L-x) + 0.1P(L-x) = 0.6P(L-x)`.\n    *   At `x=L/2` (right of center), `M(L/2)_{\\text{right}} = 0.6P(L/2) = 0.3PL`.\n    *   At `x=L`, `M(L) = 0.6P(L-L) = 0`.\n\n**Summary of BMD shape:**\n1.  Starts at `0` at `x=0`.\n2.  Increases linearly to `0.2PL` at `x=L/2` (left side).\n3.  Jumps from `0.2PL` to `0.3PL` at `x=L/2` (right side). The jump magnitude is `0.3PL - 0.2PL = 0.1PL`, which equals `M_c`.\n4.  Decreases linearly from `0.3PL` at `x=L/2` (right side) to `0` at `x=L`.\n\nThis shape perfectly matches Diagram C."

        "Identify the loading conditions: A simply supported beam of length L has a bracket welded at its center (x = L/2). A vertical load P is applied at a distance a = 0.1L from the beam's center on this bracket. This eccentric load is equivalent to a downward vertical force P acting at the beam's center and a concentrated clockwise moment M_c = P \\times a = 0.1PL acting at the beam's center.",
        "Calculate the support reactions using equilibrium equations (\\Sigma F_y = 0 and \\Sigma M = 0). For a simply supported beam with a central downward force P and a central clockwise moment M_c = 0.1PL, the reactions are R_A = 0.4P (at left support) and R_B = 0.6P (at right support).",
        "Apply the principle of superposition by considering two separate loading cases: (a) a simply supported beam with a central point load P, and (b) a simply supported beam with a central clockwise concentrated moment M_c = 0.1PL.",
        "For case (a) (central point load P), the BMD is a triangle with a maximum value of PL/4 = 0.25PL at the beam's center (x = L/2).",
        "For case (b) (central clockwise concentrated moment M_c = 0.1PL), the BMD is antisymmetric. It varies linearly from 0 at the left support to -M_c/2 = -0.05PL just to the left of the center (x = L/2-), then jumps by M_c to +M_c/2 = +0.05PL just to the right of the center (x = L/2+), and finally decreases linearly to 0 at the right support.",
        "Superimpose the two BMDs by adding their values at corresponding points along the beam. The resulting BMD starts at 0, increases linearly to (0.25PL - 0.05PL) = 0.2PL at x = L/2- (just left of center), then jumps to (0.25PL + 0.05PL) = 0.3PL at x = L/2+ (just right of center), and finally decreases linearly to 0 at the right support. The maximum positive bending moment is 0.3PL, occurring just to the right of the center.",
        "Compare the synthesized Bending Moment Diagram with the given options to identify the correct representation. The diagram will be piecewise linear, positive throughout, with a discontinuity (jump) at the center, and the maximum moment shifted to one side of the center."
