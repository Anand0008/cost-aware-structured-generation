      "reasoning": "The Newton-Raphson method typically exhibits quadratic convergence (order = 2) for simple roots. A root is considered simple if the first derivative of the function at that root is non-zero. For the given equation, f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0, the roots are x=1 and x=5. The first derivative is f'(x) = 2x - 6. Evaluating the derivative at the roots: f'(1) = 2(1) - 6 = -4 ≠ 0 and f'(5) = 2(5) - 6 = 4 ≠ 0. Since the derivative is non-zero at both roots, they are simple roots. Therefore, the Newton-Raphson method achieves its characteristic quadratic convergence, with an order of convergence equal to 2.0."
