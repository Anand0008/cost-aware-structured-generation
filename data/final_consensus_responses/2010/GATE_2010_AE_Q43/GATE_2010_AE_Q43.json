This balance accounts for the chemical energy released by the fuel, the burner efficiency, and the increase in enthalpy of the working fluid (air and combustion products).\n\nThe general energy balance equation for a combustor, considering the mass of fuel added to the air stream and burner efficiency ($\\eta_b$), is:\n$\\dot{m}_a C_p T_{t2} + \\eta_b \\dot{m}_f Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_p T_{t3}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\dot{m}_a$ is the mass flow rate of air\n*   $\\dot{m}_f$ is the mass flow rate of fuel\n*   $C_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure of the working fluid (assumed constant for air and products)\n*   $T_{t2}$ is the total temperature at the combustor inlet\n*   $T_{t3}$ is the total temperature at the combustor outlet\n*   $Q_R$ is the heating value of the fuel\n*   $\\eta_b$ is the burner efficiency\n\nTo find the fuel-air ratio $f = \\dot{m}_f / \\dot{m}_a$, divide the entire equation by $\\dot{m}_a$:\n$C_p T_{t2} + \\eta_b f Q_R = (1+f) C_p T_{t3}$\n\nExpand the right side:\n$C_p T_{t2} + \\eta_b f Q_R = C_p T_{t3} + f C_p T_{t3}$\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for $f$:\n$f (\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3}) = C_p T_{t3} - C_p T_{t2}$\n$f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2})}{\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3}}$\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n*   $T_{t2} = 1200 \\text{ K}$\n*   $T_{t3} = 2500 \\text{ K}$\n*   $Q_R = 43 \\text{ MJ/kg} = 43 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg}$\n*   $\\eta_b = 90\\% = 0.90$\n*   $C_p = 1005 \\text{ J/kgK}$\n\nNumerator: $C_p (T_{t3} - T_{t2}) = 1005 \\text{ J/kgK} \\times (2500 \\text{ K} - 1200 \\text{ K}) = 1005 \\times 1300 = 1306500 \\text{ J/kg}$\n\nDenominator: $(\\eta_b Q_R - C_p T_{t3}) = (0.90 \\times 43 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg}) - (1005 \\text{ J/kgK} \\times 2500 \\text{ K})$\n$= 38.7 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg} - 2512500 \\text{ J/kg}$\n$= 38700000 - 2512500 = 36187500 \\text{ J/kg}$\n\nCalculate $f$:\n$f = \\frac{1306500}{36187500} \\approx 0.036102$\n\nRounding to three decimal places, $f \\approx 0.036$.
