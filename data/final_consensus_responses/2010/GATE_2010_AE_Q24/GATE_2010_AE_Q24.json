      "reasoning": "Across an oblique shock, the velocity vector is resolved into components normal and tangential to the shock front. The normal component of velocity ($V_n$) decreases as it passes through the shock, behaving similarly to a normal shock. This decrease leads to compression and an increase in pressure, density, and temperature. The tangential component of velocity ($V_t$) remains unchanged across the shock due to the conservation of momentum in the direction parallel to the shock, as there are no shear forces acting tangentially in an inviscid flow model. Therefore, the statement that the normal component of velocity decreases and the tangential component remains unchanged is true."

        "Apply conservation laws across the shock for the tangential component. In an inviscid flow, there are no shear forces acting parallel to the shock wave, so the tangential component of velocity is conserved across the shock (V_{t1} = V_{t2}).",
        "Apply conservation laws across the shock for the normal component. The normal component of velocity behaves like the velocity across a normal shock, decreasing from supersonic to subsonic (V_{n2} < V_{n1}) due to compression.",
