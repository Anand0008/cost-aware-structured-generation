      "reasoning": "The maximum operating flow rate through a centrifugal compressor at a given RPM is limited by choking of the diffuser throat. As the mass flow rate increases, the fluid velocity in the compressor, especially at the diffuser inlet, rises significantly. Eventually, the velocity reaches the local speed of sound (Mach 1) at the narrowest passage, typically the diffuser throat. Once this condition is met, no further increase in mass flow rate is possible, regardless of downstream pressure reduction. This choking condition sets the right-hand boundary of the compressor's operating map. In contrast, surge limits the minimum stable flow rate (low mass flow instability), and impeller stall is a precursor to surge or a performance degradation, not the ultimate limit on maximum flow. Inlet flow distortion affects performance and stability but is not the fundamental physical limit on the maximum achievable flow rate due to sonic conditions."

        "Define choking: Choking occurs at high mass flow rates when the fluid velocity at the narrowest passage (e.g., diffuser throat) reaches the local speed of sound (Mach 1).",
        "Understand the consequence of choking: Once choking occurs, the mass flow rate cannot be increased further, regardless of downstream pressure changes. This phenomenon sets the right-hand boundary of the compressor's performance map.",
        "Differentiate from surge: Surge is an instability occurring at low mass flow rates, characterized by flow reversal and pressure oscillations, defining the left-hand boundary of the compressor map.",
        "Conclude: Since the question asks for the maximum operating flow rate limit, choking of the diffuser throat is the relevant phenomenon."
