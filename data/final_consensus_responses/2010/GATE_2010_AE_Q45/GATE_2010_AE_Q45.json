The slope of the tangent at $(a, e^a)$ is $m = e^a$.\n\n3.  **Write the equation of the tangent line:** Using the point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line is $y - e^a = e^a (x - a)$.\n\n4.  **Use the condition that the tangent passes through the origin:** Since the tangent passes through the origin $(0,0)$, substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the tangent equation:\n    $0 - e^a = e^a (0 - a)$\n    $-e^a = -a e^a$\n\n5.  **Solve for $a$:** Since $e^a$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by $e^a$:\n    $-1 = -a$\n    $a = 1$\n\n6.  **Formulate the final equation of the tangent:** Substitute $a=1$ back into the tangent equation:\n    $y - e^1 = e^1 (x - 1)$\n    $y - e = e x - e$\n    $y = e x$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent from the origin to the curve $y = e^x$ is $y = ex$.
