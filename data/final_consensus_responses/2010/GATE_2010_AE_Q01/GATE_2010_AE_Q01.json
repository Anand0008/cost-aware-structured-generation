      "reasoning": "The isentropic efficiency ($\\eta$) for a flow-diffusing device (like a diffuser) is generally defined as the ratio of the ideal (isentropic) change in a property to the actual change in that property. Specifically, it is the ratio of the ideal temperature rise to the actual temperature rise.\n\nFor a diffuser, the process involves increasing the pressure and temperature of the incoming air. Let's denote:\n*   `T_a`: Ambient static temperature (inlet static condition).\n*   `T_02`: Actual stagnation temperature at the diffuser exit.\n*   `T_02s`: Stagnation temperature at the diffuser exit if the process from ambient static conditions (`T_a`, `P_a`) to the actual exit stagnation pressure (`P_02`) were isentropic.\n\nThe ideal temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `(T_02s - T_a)`.\nThe actual temperature rise from ambient static to diffuser exit stagnation is `(T_02 - T_a)`.\n\nDue to irreversibilities (friction, turbulence) in a real diffuser, the actual process requires more 'effort' (or results in a higher temperature for a given pressure ratio) than the ideal isentropic process. Therefore, for the same pressure ratio, the actual temperature rise `(T_02 - T_a)` will be greater than the ideal temperature rise `(T_02s - T_a)`.\n\nThus, the isentropic efficiency of a diffuser is given by:\n`$\\eta_d = \\frac{\\text{Ideal Temperature Rise}}{\\text{Actual Temperature Rise}} = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_a}{T_{02} - T_a}$`\n\nThis definition ensures that `$\\eta_d < 1$` for a real diffuser, as the numerator will be smaller than the denominator. This aligns with the definition of compressor isentropic efficiency. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B uses addition instead of subtraction. Options C and D are pressure-based, but their formulation as differences is not the standard definition for diffuser efficiency."

        "Understand the function of a subsonic diffuser: It decelerates incoming air, converting kinetic energy into pressure rise (stagnation pressure increase).
