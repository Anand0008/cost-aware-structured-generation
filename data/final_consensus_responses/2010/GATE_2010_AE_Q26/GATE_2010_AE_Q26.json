      "reasoning": "The problem describes a spacecraft gaining mass (interstellar dust) while in motion. This is a classic variable mass system problem. The fundamental principle governing such systems is the generalized Newton's Second Law, which states that the net external force on a system is equal to the rate of change of its momentum, accounting for mass entering or leaving the system.\n\nThe generalized Newton's Second Law for a variable mass system is given by:\n$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = F_{ext} + v_{rel} \\frac{dm}{dt}$\nWhere:\n*   $m$ is the instantaneous mass of the spacecraft.\n*   $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ is the acceleration of the spacecraft.\n*   $F_{ext}$ is the net external force acting on the spacecraft. (Assumed to be zero in this problem).\n*   $v_{rel}$ is the velocity of the incoming (or outgoing) mass relative to the spacecraft.\n*   $\\frac{dm}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the spacecraft's mass.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n1.  $m = 100 \\text{ kg}$ (instantaneous mass of the spacecraft).\n2.  $v = 1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}$ (instantaneous speed of the spacecraft).\n3.  $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s}$ (rate at which mass is being added).\n4.  The dust was initially at rest, so its absolute velocity is $v_{dust} = 0 \\text{ m/s}$.\n5.  No external forces are mentioned, so $F_{ext} = 0$.\n\nNow, let's determine $v_{rel}$. The relative velocity of the incoming dust with respect to the spacecraft is:\n$v_{rel} = v_{dust} - v_{spacecraft} = 0 - v = -v$\n\nSubstitute these values into the generalized Newton's Second Law:\n$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = 0 + (-v) \\frac{dm}{dt}$\n$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = -v \\frac{dm}{dt}$\n\nNow, solve for the acceleration $\\frac{dv}{dt}$:\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - \\frac{v}{m} \\frac{dm}{dt}$\n\nPlug in the given numerical values:\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}}{100 \\text{ kg}} \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s})$\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - (180 \\text{ m/kg}) \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s})$\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - 576 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m/s}^2$\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = - 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the spacecraft is decelerating. The question asks for the retardation, which is the magnitude of this deceleration.\n\nRetardation $= |\\frac{dv}{dt}| = 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, $5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$ is closest to option D, $5.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$.",

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the principle. The problem involves a spacecraft gaining mass by collecting stationary dust. This is a variable mass system where the dust, upon being accelerated to the spacecraft's speed, exerts a retarding force due to momentum conservation.",
        "Step 2: Apply the principle of conservation of momentum. Consider the system at time $t$ with momentum $mv$ and at time $t+dt$ with momentum $(m+dm)(v+dv)$. The dust collected has zero initial momentum. Thus, initial momentum $P_i = mv + (dm)(0)$. Final momentum $P_f = (m+dm)(v+dv)$. Equating $P_i = P_f$ and neglecting the second-order term $dm \\, dv$.",
        "Step 3: Derive the differential equation for motion. From momentum conservation, $mv = mv + m \\, dv + v \\, dm$, which simplifies to $m \\, dv = -v \\, dm$.",
        "Step 4: Express the acceleration (retardation). Divide the equation by $dt$: $m \\frac{dv}{dt} = -v \\frac{dm}{dt}$. Therefore, the acceleration $a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{v}{m} \\frac{dm}{dt}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given values into the derived formula. Given: instantaneous mass $m = 100 \\text{ kg}$, instantaneous speed $v = 1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}$, and rate of dust pickup $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s}$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the acceleration. $a = -\\frac{1.8 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}}{100 \\text{ kg}} \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ kg/s} = -180 \\times 3.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m/s}^2 = -5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$.",
        "Step 7: Interpret the result. The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the velocity, meaning it is a retardation. The magnitude of retardation is $|a| = 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$.",
        "Step 8: Round the value. The calculated retardation is $5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$, which can be rounded to $5.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s}^2$."
