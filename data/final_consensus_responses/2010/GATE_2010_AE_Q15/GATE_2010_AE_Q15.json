      "reasoning": "In the two-body problem, such as an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth, the gravitational force is a central force. A central force is always directed along the line connecting the two bodies, towards the center of mass of the Earth. For any central force, the torque ($\\mathbf{\\tau}$) about the center of the force is zero, because the position vector ($\\mathbf{r}$) and the force vector ($\\mathbf{F}$) are parallel or anti-parallel, making their cross product zero ($\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = 0$). According to Newton's second law for rotation, the rate of change of angular momentum ($\\mathbf{L}$) is equal to the net torque acting on the system ($\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt}$). Since the torque is zero, the rate of change of angular momentum is zero, implying that the angular momentum vector ($\\mathbf{L}$) is a constant. This principle holds true for any orbit (circular, elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) under a central gravitational force. This is also the underlying principle for Kepler's Second Law, which states that the angular momentum, given by the expression $h = r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$, is a conserved quantity. Therefore, for a satellite in a highly elliptical orbit, its angular momentum about the center of mass of the Earth remains constant."
