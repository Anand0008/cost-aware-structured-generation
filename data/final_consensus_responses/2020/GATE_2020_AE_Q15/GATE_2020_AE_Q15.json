      "reasoning": "Perfectly expanded flow in an aircraft engine nozzle occurs when the static pressure of the exhaust gases at the nozzle exit ($P_e$ or $P_{\\text{exit}}$) is equal to the ambient static pressure ($P_0$ or $P_{\\text{ambient}}$). This condition is crucial for optimal expansion, as it eliminates the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_0)A_e$ from the general thrust equation, thereby maximizing the conversion of the exhaust gas's internal energy into kinetic energy without any external pressure losses or gains. Option C, 'the ambient pressure at the nozzle exit,' directly matches this definition. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they refer to stagnation pressures or inlet static pressure, which are not conditions for perfectly expanded flow."

The term (P_e - P_0) A_e represents the 'pressure thrust'.",

        "When P_e = P_0, the pressure thrust term (P_e - P_0) A_e becomes zero. This signifies that all available pressure energy has been efficiently converted into kinetic energy, and there are no additional forces due to pressure imbalances at the nozzle exit.",
