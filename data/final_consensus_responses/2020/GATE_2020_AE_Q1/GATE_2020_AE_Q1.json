So, the continuity condition on a closed interval $[a,b]$ (if $0 \\in [a,b]$) is satisfied.\n2.  **Differentiability:** The derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ is not defined at $x = 0$. This is because the left-hand derivative at $x=0$ is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{|h|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h}{h} = -1$, and the right-hand derivative at $x=0$ is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|h|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1$. Since the left-hand derivative ($-1$) is not equal to the right-hand derivative ($1$), the derivative $df/dx$ does not exist at $x=0$. The function has a sharp corner or cusp at $x=0$.\n\nSince the Mean Value Theorem requires the function to be differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$, and $f(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$, the theorem is not applicable for any interval $[a,b]$ that contains $x=0$. Option C correctly identifies this violation of the differentiability condition."
