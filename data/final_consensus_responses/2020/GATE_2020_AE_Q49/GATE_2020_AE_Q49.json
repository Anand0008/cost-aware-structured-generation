Engineers at companies like GE Aviation or Pratt & Whitney continuously optimize this, as even a 1% increase in efficiency leads to significant fuel savings and reduced operational costs for airlines over an aircraft's lifetime.",
        "why_it_matters": "Higher turbine efficiency directly translates to more power output for the same fuel consumption, or less fuel for the same power, making engines more economical and environmentally friendly. Accurately predicting and maintaining this efficiency is crucial for optimizing engine thrust, fuel consumption, and overall aircraft performance, directly impacting airline operating costs and emissions."
