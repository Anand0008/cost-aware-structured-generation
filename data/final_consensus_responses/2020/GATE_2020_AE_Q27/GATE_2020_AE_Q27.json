Specifically:\n\n**For Profile $Y_I$ (Upper Surface):**\n1.  **Before $x_A$**: Static pressure is at freestream level ($P_{\\infty}$). \n2.  **At $x_A$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the freestream (convex corner). This generates an **expansion fan**, causing static pressure to **decrease** below $P_{\\infty}$.\n3.  **Between $x_A$ and $x_B$**: Pressure remains constant at this lower level.\n4.  **At $x_B$**: The upper surface turns *into* the flow (concave corner). This generates an **oblique shock wave**, causing static pressure to **increase**. Since the pressure rise across a shock is generally stronger than the pressure drop across an expansion for the same turning angle, the pressure after this shock will be *higher* than $P_{\\infty}$.\n5.  **Between $x_B$ and $x_C$**: Pressure remains constant at this higher level.\n6.  **At $x_C$**: The upper surface turns *away* from the flow to align with the freestream. This generates another **expansion fan**, causing static pressure to **decrease** back to $P_{\\infty}$.\n\n**For Profile $Y_{II}$ (Lower Surface):**\n1.  **Before $x_A$**: Static pressure is at freestream level ($P_{\\infty}$). \n2.  **At $x_A$**: The lower surface turns *into* the freestream (concave corner). This generates an **oblique shock wave**, causing static pressure to **increase** above $P_{\\infty}$.\n3.  **Between $x_A$ and $x_B$**: Pressure remains constant at this higher level.\n4.  **At $x_B$**: The lower surface turns *away* from the flow (convex corner). This generates an **expansion fan**, causing static pressure to **decrease**. Since the pressure drop across an expansion is generally weaker than the pressure rise across a shock for the same turning angle, the pressure after this expansion will be *lower* than $P_{\\infty}$.\n5.  **Between $x_B$ and $x_C$**: Pressure remains constant at this lower level.\n6.  **At $x_C$**: The lower surface turns *into* the flow to align with the freestream. This generates another **oblique shock wave**, causing static pressure to **increase** back to $P_{\\infty}$.\n\nOption D accurately depicts these qualitative changes and the relative magnitudes of pressure compared to the freestream pressure."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the flow regime as supersonic and analyze the wedge-shaped airfoil geometry with corners at xA, xB, and xC. The task is to determine static pressure profiles along two horizontal lines, YI (above the airfoil) and YII (below the airfoil).",
        "Step 2: Recall the principles of supersonic flow interaction with corners. When the flow turns *into* a surface (concave corner), an oblique shock wave forms, increasing static pressure. When the flow turns *away* from a surface (convex corner), an expansion fan (Prandtl-Meyer expansion) forms, decreasing static pressure. Downstream of these phenomena, pressure remains nearly uniform over flat surfaces until the next corner.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the flow turning and pressure changes along the upper surface (YI). Before xA, pressure is freestream P∞. At xA, a convex corner generates an expansion fan, decreasing pressure. Between xA and xB, pressure remains constant below P∞. At xB, a concave corner generates an oblique shock, increasing pressure to a level above P∞. Between xB and xC, pressure remains constant above P∞. At xC, a convex corner generates an expansion fan, decreasing pressure back to P∞.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the flow turning and pressure changes along the lower surface (YII). Before xA, pressure is P∞. At xA, a concave corner generates an oblique shock, increasing pressure from P∞. Between xA and xB, pressure remains constant above P∞. At xB, a convex corner generates an expansion fan, decreasing pressure to a level below P∞. Between xB and xC, pressure remains constant below P∞. At xC, a concave corner generates an oblique shock, increasing pressure back to P∞.",
        "Step 5: Compare the derived qualitative pressure profiles for both YI and YII with the given options. Identify the plot that correctly shows the sequence of pressure changes (increase/decrease) and relative magnitudes (above/below P∞) at the respective corners (xA, xB, xC). The upper surface (YI) should show a pressure drop, then a rise, then a drop back to P∞. The lower surface (YII) should show a pressure rise, then a drop, then a rise back to P∞.",
        "Step 6: Conclude that Option D accurately matches the predicted pressure profiles for both YI and YII based on the analysis of oblique shocks and expansion fans."
