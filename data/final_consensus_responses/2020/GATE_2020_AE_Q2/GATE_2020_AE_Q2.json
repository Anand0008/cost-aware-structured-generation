      "reasoning": "The question asks to find the maximum of a function f(x) where λ, σ, and μ are constants. Although the explicit form of f(x) is not provided, the presence of parameters μ (mean/location) and σ (standard deviation/scale) strongly suggests that f(x) represents a probability density function (PDF) of a normal (Gaussian) distribution or a similar unimodal symmetric function. The standard form of a Gaussian PDF is:\n\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n\nTo find the maximum of this function, we need to find x where the derivative f'(x) is zero. For a Gaussian function, the pre-exponential constant \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} (or \\lambda if \\lambda incorporates this) is positive and does not affect the location of the maximum. The exponential term e^A is maximized when its exponent A = -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} is maximized.\n\nSince -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} is always non-positive, it is maximized when \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} is minimized. The minimum value of \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} is 0, which occurs when (x-\\mu)^2 = 0. This implies x - \\mu = 0, leading to x = \\mu.\n\nAlternatively, taking the derivative:\nf'(x) = f(x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = f(x) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = -f(x)\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma^2}\nSetting f'(x) = 0 (and since f(x) is always positive), we get -(x-\\mu)/\\sigma^2 = 0, which implies x - \\mu = 0, so x = \\mu.\nThe second derivative test would confirm this is a maximum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of the function occurs at x = \\mu. This corresponds to option D."

        "Step 1: Recognize that the function f(x) is implicitly a Gaussian (Normal) probability density function or proportional to it, given the parameters `$\\mu$` and `$\\sigma$`. The general form is `$f(x) = C e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$`, where C is a positive constant.",
        "Step 2: To find the maximum of f(x), we can either apply the first derivative test (set `df/dx = 0`) or recognize that for a function of the form `$f(x) = C e^A$`, where C is a positive constant, the maximum occurs when the exponent A is maximized.",
        "Step 3: (Derivative approach) Differentiate `$f(x) = C e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$` with respect to x and set it to zero. `$\\frac{df}{dx} = C e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2(x-\\mu)}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = -\\frac{C(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma^2} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$`. Setting `$\\frac{df}{dx} = 0$` implies `$-(x-\\mu) = 0$` (since `C`, `$\\sigma^2$`, and the exponential term are all positive).",
        "Step 4: (Exponent maximization approach) To maximize `$A = -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$`, we need to minimize the term `$\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$`. Since `$\\sigma^2$` is positive, this means minimizing `$(x-\\mu)^2$`.",
        "Step 5: Both methods lead to the condition `$(x-\\mu) = 0$`.",
        "Step 6: Solving `$(x-\\mu) = 0$` yields `x = \\mu`. Therefore, the function f(x) attains its maximum value at `x = \\mu`.",
        "Step 7: (Optional) To confirm this is a maximum, one can perform the second derivative test. The second derivative `$\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$` evaluated at `x = \\mu` will be negative, confirming a local maximum.",
