For a solid circular shaft, τ_max = (2T)/(π R^3). Setting τ_max = σ_y/2 and solving for radius R gives R = (4T/(π σ_y))^(1/3). Substituting T = 10 kNm = 10^4 Nm and σ_y = 280 MPa = 280×10^6 Pa yields R ≈ 0.0357 m = 3.57 cm, which falls within the official answer range of 3.55-3.58 cm."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify failure criterion and given data. For Tresca (Maximum Shear Stress) theory, yielding occurs when τ_max ≥ τ_y, where τ_y = σ_y/2 (from uniaxial tension test). Given: σ_y = 280 MPa, torque T = 10 kNm = 10^4 Nm.",
        "Step 1: Convert the given values to consistent units. The uniaxial yield strength $\\sigma_y = 280 \\text{ MPa} = 280 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}$ and the applied torque $T = 10 \\text{ kNm} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Nm}$.",
        "Step 2: Determine the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) in a solid circular shaft under pure torsion. The shear stress distribution is linear, with maximum stress occurring at the outer surface (r = R). The formula is $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T \\cdot R}{J}$, where $J$ is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid circular cross-section, $J = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$. Substituting $J$, we get $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T \\cdot R}{(\\pi R^4)/2} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3}$.",
        "Step 3: Apply Tresca's Maximum Shear Stress Theory. For ductile materials, yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) in the component reaches half of the uniaxial yield strength ($\\sigma_y/2$). Therefore, the failure criterion is $\\tau_{max} \\le \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2}$. Substituting the expression for $\\tau_{max}$: $\\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3} \\le \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2}$.",
        "Step 4: Rearrange the inequality to solve for the minimum required radius $R$. From $\\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3} \\le \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2}$, we get $R^3 \\ge \\frac{4T}{\\pi \\sigma_y}$. Taking the cube root, the minimum radius is $R = \\left(\\frac{4T}{\\pi \\sigma_y}\\right)^{1/3}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the numerical values into the formula for $R^3$: $R^3 = \\frac{4 \\times (10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Nm})}{\\pi \\times (280 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2)} \\approx \\frac{40000}{8.796 \\times 10^8} \\approx 4.547 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^3$.",
        "Step 6: Compute the cube root to find the minimum radius $R$: $R = (4.547 \\times 10^{-5})^{1/3} \\approx 0.03569 \\text{ m}$.",

        "name": "Von Mises Yield Criterion (Distortion Energy Criterion)",
        "description": "For pure torsion, von Mises equivalent stress σ_e = √3·τ. Yielding occurs when σ_e ≥ σ_y, so τ ≤ σ_y/√3. This criterion considers the distortion energy of the material and generally predicts yielding at a higher stress level than Tresca's criterion.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More accurate for ductile materials, often less conservative than Tresca. Cons: Slightly more complex for multi-axial stress states; yields a smaller radius (less conservative) for pure torsion compared to Tresca.",
        "when_to_use": "When higher accuracy is required, when the problem explicitly specifies the Von Mises criterion, or for more realistic design of ductile shafts, especially in modern design codes."
