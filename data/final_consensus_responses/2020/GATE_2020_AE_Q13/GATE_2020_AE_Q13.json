      "reasoning": "A centrifugal compressor's primary function is to increase the pressure of the working fluid. The rotating impeller imparts energy to the fluid, primarily in the form of kinetic energy, which then converts to static pressure and contributes to an increase in total (stagnation) enthalpy. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, work input to the compressor increases the stagnation enthalpy, leading to an increase in stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure. Therefore, the exit stagnation pressure (P₀₂) will always be greater than the inlet stagnation pressure (P₀₁) across the impeller, as long as the impeller is rotating and doing work. The 'closed exit' condition means there is no mass flow, but the impeller still performs work on the trapped fluid, creating a pressure rise due to centrifugal forces and energy addition, resulting in a stagnation pressure ratio greater than 1."

        "A compressor is a turbomachine designed to increase the pressure of a fluid by adding energy to it. The rotating impeller is the component that does work on the fluid.",
        "The impeller imparts kinetic energy to the fluid, accelerating it radially outwards. This work done on the fluid increases its total energy, which is represented by stagnation enthalpy.",
        "For a gas, an increase in stagnation enthalpy directly corresponds to an increase in stagnation temperature and, consequently, stagnation pressure.",
        "Even with a closed exit (zero mass flow), the impeller continues to rotate and impart energy to the fluid within its passages. This centrifugal action and energy input still cause the static and thus stagnation pressure of the fluid to rise from the inlet to the exit of the impeller.",
        "Therefore, since energy is continuously added by the rotating impeller, the stagnation pressure at the exit of the impeller ($P_{02}$) must be greater than the stagnation pressure at the inlet ($P_{01}$). Thus, the ratio $P_{02}/P_{01}$ must be greater than 1."
