      "reasoning": "The dynamic viscosity of fluids is highly dependent on temperature, but the nature of this dependence differs significantly between liquids and gases due to their distinct molecular structures and dominant intermolecular forces.\n\nFor **liquids (like water)**, viscosity primarily arises from the cohesive forces between molecules. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, weakening these intermolecular forces. This allows molecules to move past each other more easily, reducing the fluid's resistance to shear. Therefore, the dynamic viscosity of water decreases with an increase in temperature.\n\nFor **gases (like air)**, viscosity is mainly due to the momentum transfer between adjacent layers of fluid moving at different velocities. As temperature increases, the random thermal motion of gas molecules becomes more energetic and frequent. This leads to more frequent and more energetic collisions between molecules across different layers, resulting in a greater transfer of momentum. Consequently, the resistance to shear increases, and thus the dynamic viscosity of air increases with an increase in temperature. This behavior is described by empirical relations like Sutherland's Law. Option C accurately reflects these two distinct behaviors: it decreases for water (liquid) and increases for air (gas)."
