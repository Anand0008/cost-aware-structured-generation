        "description": "Simpson's 1/3 rule approximates the integral by fitting parabolas through every pair of subintervals. For n even, with h=(b-a)/n, it uses $I_S = \\frac{h}{3}[f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \\dots + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)]$. It generally provides higher accuracy than the trapezoidal rule for the same number of function evaluations.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Higher accuracy (O(h^4) for single, O(h^5) for composite) for a given h, usually much smaller error for smooth functions. Cons: Requires an even number of subintervals; slightly more complex coefficients/formula.",
        "when_to_use": "When higher accuracy is needed for smooth functions and the number of intervals can be chosen as even."
