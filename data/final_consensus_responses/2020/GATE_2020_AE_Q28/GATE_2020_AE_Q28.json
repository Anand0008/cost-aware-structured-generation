Bulk Modulus (K) in terms of Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio (ν):\n    `K = E / (3 * (1 - 2 * nu))`\n\nGiven that `G = K`, we can equate the two expressions:\n`E / (2 * (1 + nu)) = E / (3 * (1 - 2 * nu))`\n\nSince Young's Modulus (E) is a non-zero material property, we can cancel E from both sides:\n`1 / (2 * (1 + nu)) = 1 / (3 * (1 - 2 * nu))`\n\nCross-multiply:\n`3 * (1 - 2 * nu) = 2 * (1 + nu)`\n\nExpand both sides:\n`3 - 6 * nu = 2 + 2 * nu`\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for ν:\n`3 - 2 = 2 * nu + 6 * nu`\n`1 = 8 * nu`\n`nu = 1 / 8`\n\nThus, the value of Poisson's ratio is ν = 1/8, which corresponds to option D."
