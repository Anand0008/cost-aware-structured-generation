      "reasoning": "The shaded area is the area of the circle minus the area of the inscribed rectangle. For a rectangle inscribed in a circle to have maximum area, it must be a square. Let the radius of the circle be 'a'. The diameter of the circle is '2a', which also serves as the diagonal of the inscribed square. If 's' is the side length of the square, then by the Pythagorean theorem, $s^2 + s^2 = (2a)^2$. This simplifies to $2s^2 = 4a^2$, so $s^2 = 2a^2$. The area of the square is $s^2 = 2a^2$. The area of the circle is $\\pi a^2$. Therefore, the area of the shaded portion is $\\pi a^2 - 2a^2$."
