      "reasoning": "The upstream Mach number M1 is found by solving the oblique shock relations using the given shock angle (β = 35°), flow deflection angle (θ = 5.75°), downstream temperature (T2 = 182.46 K), and upstream velocity (V1 = 517.56 m/s). Two independent approaches (θ-β-M relation and temperature ratio relation) yield M1 ≈ 2.0, which matches the answer key range of 1.9 to 2.1. The calculation is consistent with conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) for a calorically perfect gas.\n\nOne common approach is to directly apply the θ-β-M relation for oblique shock waves. This fundamental equation relates the flow deflection angle (θ), the shock wave angle (β), the upstream Mach number (M1), and the specific heat ratio (γ). Given θ = 5.75°, β = 35°, and γ = 1.4, we substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$\\tan\\theta = 2 \\cot\\beta \\frac{M_1^2 \\sin^2\\beta - 1}{M_1^2(\\gamma + \\cos2\\beta) + 2}$\n\n$\\tan(5.75^\\circ) = 2 \\cot(35^\\circ) \\frac{M_1^2 \\sin^2(35^\\circ) - 1}{M_1^2(1.4 + \\cos(2 \\times 35^\\circ)) + 2}$\n\nCalculating the trigonometric values:\n$\\tan(5.75^\\circ) \\approx 0.10082$\n$\\cot(35^\\circ) \\approx 1.42815$\n$\\sin(35^\\circ) \\approx 0.57358 \\implies \\sin^2(35^\\circ) \\approx 0.32899$\n$\\cos(70^\\circ) \\approx 0.34202$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$0.10082 = 2 \\times 1.42815 \\frac{M_1^2 \\times 0.32899 - 1}{M_1^2(1.4 + 0.34202) + 2}$\n$0.10082 = 2.8563 \\frac{0.32899 M_1^2 - 1}{1.74202 M_1^2 + 2}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $M_1^2$:\n$\\frac{0.10082}{2.8563} = \\frac{0.32899 M_1^2 - 1}{1.74202 M_1^2 + 2}$\n$0.03530 = \\frac{0.32899 M_1^2 - 1}{1.74202 M_1^2 + 2}$\n$0.03530 (1.74202 M_1^2 + 2) = 0.32899 M_1^2 - 1$\n$0.06140 M_1^2 + 0.07060 = 0.32899 M_1^2 - 1$\n$1 + 0.07060 = (0.32899 - 0.06140) M_1^2$\n$1.07060 = 0.26759 M_1^2$\n$M_1^2 = \\frac{1.07060}{0.26759} \\approx 4.0001$\n\nTaking the square root:\n$M_1 \\approx \\sqrt{4.0001} \\approx 2.0000$\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, $M_1 = 2.0$. For this specific method, the other given parameters ($V_1$, $T_2$, $R$, $C_p$) are extraneous, though they would be used in alternative approaches like the temperature ratio method."

        "Step 1: Identify given parameters: Upstream velocity V1 = 517.56 m/s, shock angle β = 35°, flow deflection angle θ = 5.75°, downstream static temperature T2 = 182.46 K, gas constant R = 287 J/(kg·K), specific heat ratio γ = 1.4, specific heat at constant pressure Cp = 1005 J/(kg·K). The goal is to find the upstream Mach number (M1).",
        "Step 2: Recall that the upstream Mach number M1 = V1 / a1, where a1 = sqrt(γ R T1) is the speed of sound upstream. T1 is unknown and must be found using oblique shock relations.",
        "Step 3: Use the temperature ratio across an oblique shock, which depends on the normal component of upstream Mach number M_n1 = M1 sin β. The ratio is: T2/T1 = (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M_n1^2) * (γ M_n1^2 - (γ-1)/2) / (((γ+1)/2)^2 * M_n1^2).",
        "Step 4: Express T1 in terms of M1 and V1: T1 = V1^2 / (γ R M1^2). Substitute this into the temperature ratio equation to get an equation for T2 in terms of M1.",
        "Step 5: Substitute numerical values into the derived equation. Calculate constants like sin β ≈ 0.5736. Let x = M1, then M_n1 = 0.5736 x, and M_n1^2 = 0.329 x^2. The equation becomes: 182.46 = (517.56^2/(1.4*287*x^2)) * [(1 + 0.2 * 0.329 x^2) * (1.4 * 0.329 x^2 - 0.2)] / (1.44 * 0.329 x^2).",
        "Step 6: Solve the equation numerically for M1. Verify the result using the θ-β-M relation: tan θ = 2 cot β (M1^2 sin^2 β - 1) / [M1^2 (γ + cos 2β) + 2]. For M1 = 2.0, the calculated θ ≈ 5.75°, which matches the given value, confirming M1 = 2.0.",
