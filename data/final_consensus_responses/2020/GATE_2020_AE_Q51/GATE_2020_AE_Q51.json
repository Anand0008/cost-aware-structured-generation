The critical damping coefficient is given by $c_{cr} = 2\\sqrt{k m}$, where $k$ is the spring stiffness and $m$ is the mass. Therefore, the damping ratio can be expressed as $\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{k m}}$.\n\nInitially, the system is critically damped, which means the original damping ratio $\\zeta_{org} = 1$. So, for the original state:\n$1 = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}$\nThis implies $c = 2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}$ (Equation 1)\n\nAfter softening of the spring, the system becomes overdamped with a new damping ratio $\\zeta_{new} = 1.2$. The problem states that the mass ($m$) and damping coefficient ($c$) remain unchanged. So, for the new state:\n$1.2 = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$ (Equation 2)\n\nTo find the ratio of the original spring stiffness to the new spring stiffness ($\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}$), we can divide Equation 2 by Equation 1, or substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n$\\frac{\\zeta_{new}}{\\zeta_{org}} = \\frac{c/(2\\sqrt{k_{new} m})}{c/(2\\sqrt{k_{org} m})}$\n$1.2 / 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$\n$1.2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$\n\nSquaring both sides to solve for the ratio:\n$(\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}) = (1.2)^2$\n$(\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}) = 1.44$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the ratio is 1.44."

        "Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal. The system is a single degree of freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper. Initially, it is critically damped ($\\xi_{org} = 1$). After a change, it becomes overdamped with a new damping ratio ($\\xi_{new} = 1.2$). The mass ($m$) and damping coefficient ($C$) remain unchanged. The goal is to find the ratio of original spring stiffness to new spring stiffness ($\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}$).",
        "Step 2: Recall the formula for the damping ratio ($\\xi$) for an SDOF system: $\\xi = \\frac{C}{C_{critical}}$, where $C$ is the actual damping coefficient and $C_{critical}$ is the critical damping coefficient. The critical damping coefficient is given by $C_{critical} = 2\\sqrt{k m}$, where $k$ is the spring stiffness and $m$ is the mass. Combining these, $\\xi = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k m}}$.",
        "Step 3: Apply the damping ratio formula to the original (critically damped) condition. Since $\\xi_{org} = 1$, we have $1 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}$. This allows us to express the damping coefficient $C$ in terms of $k_{org}$ and $m$: $C = 2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the damping ratio formula to the new (overdamped) condition. Since $\\xi_{new} = 1.2$, and the damping coefficient 'C' and mass 'm' are unchanged, we have $1.2 = \\frac{C}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the expression for $C$ from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4: $1.2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{k_{org} m}}{2\\sqrt{k_{new} m}}$.",
        "Step 6: Simplify the equation. The $2$ and $\\sqrt{m}$ terms cancel out, leaving $1.2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}}}$.",
        "Step 7: Solve for the required ratio. Square both sides of the equation to find $\\frac{k_{org}}{k_{new}} = (1.2)^2$.",
        "Step 8: Calculate the final numerical value: $(1.2)^2 = 1.44$."

Since $\\xi \\propto 1/\\sqrt{k}$ (for constant c and m), a softer spring (lower k) increases $\\xi$. Therefore, $k_{org}$ must be greater than $k_{new}$, meaning the ratio $k_{org}/k_{new}$ must be greater than 1. Eliminate options less than 1. The expected value is $(1.2)^2 = 1.44$.",
