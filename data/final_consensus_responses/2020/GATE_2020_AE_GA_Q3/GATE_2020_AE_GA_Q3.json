      "reasoning": "The analogy 'Explicit: Implicit' establishes an antonymous relationship, where 'explicit' means clearly stated and 'implicit' means implied or not directly stated. Similarly, for 'Express: ___', we need an antonym for 'Express'. 'Express' means to convey a thought, feeling, or idea directly. 'Repress' means to restrain, prevent, or inhibit the expression or development of something, making it a direct antonym. While 'suppress' is similar, 'repress' often carries the nuance of holding back internal feelings or thoughts from being expressed, which aligns more closely with the idea of something being 'implicit' (not outwardly shown or stated) compared to 'explicit' (outwardly shown or stated). Therefore, 'Repress' is the most fitting word."

        "Identify the relationship between 'Explicit' and 'Implicit'. They are antonyms or opposites.",
        "Apply this antonymous relationship to the second part of the analogy: 'Express: ___'.",
        "Define 'Express'. 'Express' means to convey, state, or make known a thought or feeling.",
        "Evaluate the given options to find the antonym of 'Express':\n    *   A. Impress: To make a strong positive impact. Not an antonym.\n    *   B. Repress: To hold back, restrain, or prevent the expression of something. This is a direct antonym.\n    *   C. Compress: To reduce in size or volume by pressure. Not an antonym.\n    *   D. Suppress: To forcibly put an end to or prevent the development/expression of something. While similar to 'repress', 'repress' often more specifically refers to holding back an internal expression, which fits the 'implicit' vs 'explicit' contrast well.",
        "Conclude that 'Repress' is the best fit to complete the analogy.",
