Similarly, 'die of diseases' is the grammatically preferred phrase to indicate the cause of death when referring to illnesses. Option A provides this correct combination. While 'die from' can be used for external causes like injuries, 'die of' is specific to diseases, and 'during' is less idiomatic than 'in' for accidents."

        "Analyze the second blank: 'many other die ___ diseases like cardio vascular disease, cancer, etc.'. The correct preposition to indicate the cause of death when referring to an illness or disease is 'of'. We say 'die of diseases'.",
        "Evaluate the options for the second blank. 'Die of diseases' is the standard and most commonly accepted idiomatic expression. While 'die from diseases' is also used, 'of' is generally preferred in formal English when the cause is an illness. Therefore, the pair 'in, of' is the most appropriate.",
        "Combine the best fits: The most suitable combination is 'in' for the first blank and 'of' for the second blank.",
        "Check the given options: Option A matches this combination ('in, of')."
