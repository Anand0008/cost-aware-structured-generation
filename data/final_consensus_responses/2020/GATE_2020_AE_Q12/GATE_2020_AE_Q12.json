      "reasoning": "For conventional airplanes, standard aerodynamic sign conventions define a positive rudder deflection (δr > 0) as the trailing edge moving to the left.\n\n1.  **Yaw Control Derivative (Cn_dr):** A positive rudder deflection (trailing edge left) generates an aerodynamic side force on the vertical tail to the right (positive Y-axis force). Since the vertical tail is located behind the aircraft's center of gravity, this rightward force creates a yawing moment that turns the nose of the aircraft to the left. A leftward yaw is conventionally defined as a negative yawing moment (Cn < 0). Therefore, for a positive δr resulting in a negative Cn, the yaw control derivative Cn_dr = ∂Cn/∂δr must be **negative** (Cn_dr < 0).\n\n2.  **Roll Control Derivative (Cl_dr):** The same positive rudder deflection (trailing edge left) that creates a rightward force on the vertical tail also induces a rolling moment. For conventional aircraft, the vertical tail's center of pressure is typically located above the aircraft's longitudinal (roll) axis. This means the rightward force acts above the roll axis, creating a moment that tends to roll the aircraft right wing up. A right-wing-up roll is conventionally defined as a positive rolling moment (Cl > 0). Therefore, for a positive δr resulting in a positive Cl, the roll control derivative Cl_dr = ∂Cl/∂δr must be **positive** (Cl_dr > 0).\n\nCombining these, the correct option is A: Cl_dr > 0 and Cn_dr < 0."

        "A positive rudder deflection (trailing edge left) creates an aerodynamic force on the vertical tail that pushes the tail to the right (positive Y direction). This force, acting aft of the center of gravity, generates a yawing moment that turns the aircraft's nose to the left.",
        "By standard sign convention (right-hand rule), a nose-left yawing moment is negative. Therefore, the yaw control derivative $C_{n_{\\delta_r}} = \\frac{\\partial C_N}{\\partial \\delta_r}$ is negative ($C_{n_{\\delta_r}} < 0$).",
        "The same rightward force on the vertical tail acts above the aircraft's longitudinal (roll) axis for conventional aircraft. This vertical offset creates a rolling moment that tends to roll the aircraft to the right (right wing up).",

In crosswind landings, the rudder is used to align the aircraft's nose with the runway while the wings are often banked to counter the crosswind, making the interaction of roll and yaw control critical.",
        "why_it_matters": "A thorough understanding of these control couplings is essential for flight control system designers to ensure stable, predictable, and desirable handling qualities. Misjudging these effects can lead to adverse aircraft behavior, increased pilot workload, or even unsafe flight conditions."

        "industry_example": "In modern airliners, a yaw damper uses rudder deflections proportional to yaw rate. Because of C_L_{\\delta_r}, this also affects roll damping and spiral stability, which must be carefully modeled.",
        "why_it_matters": "If cross-coupling via C_L_{\\delta_r} is ignored, SAS design may inadvertently degrade roll stability or create uncomfortable motions."

      "triage_tip": "This is a fundamental conceptual question. If you have a clear understanding of aerodynamic sign conventions and control surface effects, it's a quick and easy mark. Quickly recall the typical signs: positive rudder (trailing edge left) gives C_l_delta_r > 0 and C_n_delta_r < 0. If unsure, quickly sketch the aircraft and rudder deflection to visualize the forces and moments.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, try to recall at least one of the signs correctly (e.g., rudder primarily controls yaw, so C_N_delta_r < 0 for positive deflection). Use this to eliminate options. Remember that cross-coupling often has mixed signs, making options with opposite signs more plausible. If you only remember C_n_delta_r is negative, that can often eliminate multiple choices.",
      "time_management": "Allocate no more than 1-2 minutes for this question. It's either known quickly or requires a brief visualization. If you cannot recall the sign convention, make an educated guess after eliminating options and move on to avoid a time sink."

For a positive rudder deflection, sketch the side force direction on the tail.
