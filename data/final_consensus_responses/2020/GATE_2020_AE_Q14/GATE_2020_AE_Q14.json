Hypergolic propellants are those that ignite spontaneously upon contact without the need for an external ignition source. The retrieved knowledge confirms that Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine (UDMH) as the fuel and Dinitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4), also known as Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO), as the oxidizer is a classic and widely used hypergolic propellant combination. They ignite spontaneously upon contact, offering high reliability for rocket engine starts. The other options provided are not hypergolic propellant combinations:\n- Liquid hydrogen – liquid oxygen (LH2 – LOX) is a non-hypergolic, cryogenic propellant combination requiring an external ignition source.\n- Rocket fuel RP-1 – liquid oxygen (RP-1 – LOX) is also a non-hypergolic propellant combination requiring an external ignition source.\n- Liquid hydrogen – liquid fluorine (LH2 – LF2) is generally non-hypergolic and cryogenic, requiring an igniter for controlled combustion.\nTherefore, option B is the correct hypergolic propellant combination."

Key examples include hydrazine-family fuels (like Hydrazine, Monomethylhydrazine (MMH), Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)) paired with oxidizers like Nitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4) or Nitric Acid. This property provides high reliability and allows for multiple restarts, making them ideal for spacecraft maneuvering thrusters and upper-stage engines.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate each given option against the definition and known examples of hypergolic propellant combinations.",
        "Step 4: Option A (Liquid hydrogen – liquid oxygen) is a cryogenic, non-hypergolic combination, requiring an external igniter for combustion.",

        "Step 7: Option B (Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine – Nitrogen Tetroxide) is a classic and well-known hypergolic combination. UDMH is a hydrazine-family fuel, and N2O4 is a common hypergolic oxidizer; they ignite instantly upon contact.",
        "Step 8: Conclude that Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine – Nitrogen Tetroxide is the correct hypergolic propellant combination among the given choices."
