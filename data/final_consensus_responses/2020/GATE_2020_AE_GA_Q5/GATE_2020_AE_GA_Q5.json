      "reasoning": "The definition of a superadditive function is $f(x+y) \\ge f(x) + f(y)$. The question specifies the domain for $x$ as $x > 1$. For a function to be superadditive on a domain $D$, it is generally understood that both $x$ and $y$ must be elements of $D$, and $x+y$ must also be in $D$. Therefore, we consider $x > 1$ and $y > 1$.\n\n1.  **Option A: $f(x) = e^x$**\n    We need to check if $e^{x+y} \\ge e^x + e^y$ for $x > 1, y > 1$.\n    This inequality can be rewritten as $e^x e^y \\ge e^x + e^y$.\n    Rearranging the terms, we get $e^x e^y - e^x - e^y \\ge 0$.\n    Adding 1 to both sides: $e^x e^y - e^x - e^y + 1 \\ge 1$.\n    Factoring the left side: $(e^x - 1)(e^y - 1) \\ge 1$.\n    Since $x > 1$, we know $e^x > e$. Therefore, $e^x - 1 > e - 1$.\n    Similarly, since $y > 1$, we know $e^y > e$. Therefore, $e^y - 1 > e - 1$.\n    Multiplying these inequalities, we get $(e^x - 1)(e^y - 1) > (e - 1)^2$.\n    Numerically, $e \\approx 2.718$, so $e - 1 \\approx 1.718$. Then $(e - 1)^2 \\approx (1.718)^2 \\approx 2.95 > 1$.\n    Since $(e^x - 1)(e^y - 1) > 1$, the condition $(e^x - 1)(e^y - 1) \\ge 1$ is satisfied.\n    Thus, $f(x) = e^x$ is a superadditive function for $x > 1$ (and $y > 1$).\n\n2.  **Option B: $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$**\n    We need to check if $\\sqrt{x+y} \\ge \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}$ for $x > 1, y > 1$.\n    Since both sides are positive, we can square them without changing the inequality direction:\n    $(\\sqrt{x+y})^2 \\ge (\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y})^2$\n    $x+y \\ge x + y + 2\\sqrt{xy}$\n    $0 \\ge 2\\sqrt{xy}$\n    This inequality is false for $x > 1, y > 1$, as $2\\sqrt{xy}$ is always positive. For example, if $x=2, y=2$, then $0 \\ge 2\\sqrt{4} = 4$, which is false. In fact, $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is subadditive.\n\n3.  **Option C: $f(x) = 1/x$**\n    We need to check if $\\frac{1}{x+y} \\ge \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}$ for $x > 1, y > 1$.\n    Combine the terms on the right side:\n    $\\frac{1}{x+y} \\ge \\frac{y+x}{xy}$\n    Since all terms are positive for $x, y > 1$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides and reverse the inequality sign:\n    $x+y \\le \\frac{xy}{x+y}$\n    Multiply both sides by $(x+y)$:\n    $(x+y)^2 \\le xy$\n    $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\le xy$\n    $x^2 + xy + y^2 \\le 0$\n    This inequality is false for $x > 1, y > 1$, as $x^2, xy, y^2$ are all positive. For example, if $x=2, y=2$, then $4+4+4 = 12 \\le 0$, which is false. In fact, $f(x) = 1/x$ is subadditive.\n\n4.  **Option D: $f(x) = e^{-x}$**\n    We need to check if $e^{-(x+y)} \\ge e^{-x} + e^{-y}$ for $x > 1, y > 1$.\n    This can be rewritten as $e^{-x} e^{-y} \\ge e^{-x} + e^{-y}$.\n    Divide both sides by $e^{-x} e^{-y}$ (which is always positive):\n    $1 \\ge \\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x} e^{-y}} + \\frac{e^{-y}}{e^{-x} e^{-y}}$\n    $1 \\ge e^y + e^x$\n    This inequality is false for $x > 1, y > 1$. Since $x > 1$, $e^x > e \\approx 2.718$. Similarly, $e^y > e$. Thus, $e^x + e^y > 2e \\approx 5.436$. Clearly, $1 \\ge 5.436$ is false. For example, if $x=2, y=2$, then $1 \\ge e^2 + e^2 = 2e^2 \\approx 14.78$, which is false. In fact, $f(x) = e^{-x}$ is subadditive.\n\nBased on this analysis, only $f(x) = e^x$ satisfies the superadditive property under the given conditions."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the definition of a superadditive function. A function $f(x)$ is superadditive if for all $x, y$ in its domain such that $x+y$ is also in its domain, the inequality $f(x+y) \\ge f(x) + f(y)$ holds.",
        "Step 2: Define the domain for testing. The question specifies \"for $x > 1$\", implying the domain of interest is $(1, \\infty)$. Therefore, when testing the superadditive property, we must consider $x > 1$ and $y > 1$ (so that $x, y \\in (1, \\infty)$ and $x+y \\in (1, \\infty)$).",
        "Step 3: Test Option A: $f(x) = e^x$. Substitute $f(x) = e^x$ into the superadditive inequality: $e^{x+y} \\ge e^x + e^y$. Using the property $e^{x+y} = e^x e^y$, rewrite the inequality as $e^x e^y \\ge e^x + e^y$. Divide all terms by $e^x e^y$ (which is positive for $x, y > 1$) to get $1 \\ge \\frac{1}{e^y} + \\frac{1}{e^x}$, or $1 \\ge e^{-y} + e^{-x}$.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate the inequality for Option A. Since $x > 1$ and $y > 1$, we know that $e^{-x} < e^{-1}$ and $e^{-y} < e^{-1}$. Therefore, $e^{-x} + e^{-y} < e^{-1} + e^{-1} = 2e^{-1}$. As $2e^{-1} \\approx 0.7358$, the inequality $1 \\ge 0.7358$ is true. Thus, $f(x) = e^x$ is superadditive under these conditions.",
        "Step 5: Test Option B: $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. Substitute into the inequality: $\\sqrt{x+y} \\ge \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}$. Square both sides (valid as all terms are positive for $x, y > 1$): $x+y \\ge (\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y})^2 = x + y + 2\\sqrt{xy}$. This simplifies to $0 \\ge 2\\sqrt{xy}$, which is false for $x, y > 1$. Hence, $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is not superadditive.",
        "Step 6: Test Option C: $f(x) = 1/x$. Substitute into the inequality: $\\frac{1}{x+y} \\ge \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}$. Combine terms on the right: $\\frac{1}{x+y} \\ge \\frac{x+y}{xy}$. Take reciprocals and reverse the inequality (valid as all terms are positive): $x+y \\le \\frac{xy}{x+y}$. Multiply by $(x+y)$: $(x+y)^2 \\le xy$, which expands to $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\le xy$. This simplifies to $x^2 + xy + y^2 \\le 0$, which is false for $x, y > 1$. Hence, $f(x) = 1/x$ is not superadditive.",
        "Step 7: Test Option D: $f(x) = e^{-x}$. Substitute into the inequality: $e^{-(x+y)} \\ge e^{-x} + e^{-y}$. This can be written as $e^{-x} e^{-y} \\ge e^{-x} + e^{-y}$. Divide by $e^{-x} e^{-y}$: $1 \\ge e^y + e^x$. This is false for $x, y > 1$, as $e^x > e$ and $e^y > e$, so $e^x + e^y > 2e \\approx 5.436$. Hence, $f(x) = e^{-x}$ is not superadditive.",
        "Step 8: Conclude the correct option. Based on the analysis, only $f(x) = e^x$ satisfies the superadditive property for $x > 1$ (and $y > 1$)."
