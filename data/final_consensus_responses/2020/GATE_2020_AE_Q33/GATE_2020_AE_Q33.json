      "reasoning": "To ensure an axial compressor develops the 'same performance characteristics' under different inlet stagnation temperatures, it must operate at the same non-dimensional parameters. The most critical non-dimensional parameter for speed is the corrected speed. The corrected speed is defined as $N_c = N / \\sqrt{T_{01}}$, where $N$ is the actual rotor speed and $T_{01}$ is the inlet stagnation temperature. For the compressor to maintain the same performance, its corrected speed must remain constant between the design and test conditions.\n\nGiven:\nDesign rotor speed, $N_{design} = 15000$ rpm\nDesign inlet stagnation temperature, $T_{01,design} = 300$ K\nTest inlet stagnation temperature, $T_{01,test} = 280$ K\n\nWe need to find the rotor speed during the test, $N_{test}$.\n\nEquating the corrected speeds for design and test conditions:\n$\\frac{N_{design}}{\\sqrt{T_{01,design}}} = \\frac{N_{test}}{\\sqrt{T_{01,test}}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $N_{test}$:\n$N_{test} = N_{design} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{01,test}}{T_{01,design}}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$N_{test} = 15000 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{280}{300}}$\n$N_{test} = 15000 \\times \\sqrt{0.933333...}$\n$N_{test} = 15000 \\times 0.9660917$\n$N_{test} = 14491.375$ rpm\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, $N_{test} \\approx 14491$ rpm, which corresponds to option B."
