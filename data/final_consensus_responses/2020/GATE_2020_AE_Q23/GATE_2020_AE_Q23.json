      "reasoning": "The stagnation temperature rise across an axial compressor rotor is directly related to the work done on the fluid, which can be calculated using Euler's turbomachinery equation. For an axial compressor rotor with constant blade speed (U), the specific work input (W) equals the change in angular momentum: W = U * (C_{θ2} - C_{θ1}). Given no pre-whirl (C_{θ1} = 0), the work done per unit mass ($W_c$) is $U C_{θ2}$. This work is converted into stagnation enthalpy rise, which for a perfect gas is Δh₀ = C_p * ΔT₀. Equating these, we get ΔT₀ = (U C_{θ2}) / C_p. Substituting the given values: U = 200 m/s, C_{θ2} = 150 m/s, and C_p = 1005 J/(kg K), the calculation yields ΔT₀ = (200 * 150) / 1005 ≈ 29.8507 K. Rounded to one decimal place, the answer is 29.9 K, which lies within the typical acceptable range for such problems."

        "Step 3: Relate work input to stagnation temperature rise. For a calorically perfect gas, the stagnation enthalpy rise equals the work input: \\Delta h_0 = C_p * \\Delta T_0 = W.",
        "Step 4: Apply given conditions. The problem states no pre-whirl, so C_{\\theta1} = 0 m/s. C_{\\theta2} = 150 m/s, U = 200 m/s, C_p = 1005 J/(kg\\cdotK).",
        "Step 5: Calculate the work input: W = U * (C_{\\theta2} - C_{\\theta1}) = 200 m/s * (150 m/s - 0 m/s) = 30000 m\\textsuperscript{2}/s\\textsuperscript{2} = 30000 J/kg.",
