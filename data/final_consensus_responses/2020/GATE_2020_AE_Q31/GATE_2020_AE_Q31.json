      "reasoning": "Directional static stability is determined by the sign of the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle, `C_N_beta` (or `dC_N / d_beta`). For an aircraft to be directionally stable, `C_N_beta` must be positive (`C_N_beta > 0`). This means that a positive sideslip angle (`beta > 0`, wind from the right) should generate a positive yawing moment (`C_N > 0`, nose turns right) to restore the aircraft to its original heading, reducing the sideslip.\n\nWe can approximate `C_N_beta` using the given discrete data points as `(Delta C_N) / (Delta beta)`.\n\n1.  **For Airplane A:**\n    *   At `beta = 0^\\circ`, `C_n = 0`\n    *   At `beta = 5^\\circ`, `C_n = 0.01`\n    *   `C_N_beta_A = (0.01 - 0) / (5^\\circ - 0^\\circ) = 0.01 / 5 = 0.002` per degree.\n    *   Since `C_N_beta_A = 0.002 > 0`, Airplane A is **directionally stable**.\n\n2.  **For Airplane B:**\n    *   At `beta = 0^\\circ`, `C_n = 0`\n    *   At `beta = 5^\\circ`, `C_n = 0.005`\n    *   `C_N_beta_B = (0.005 - 0) / (5^\\circ - 0^\\circ) = 0.005 / 5 = 0.001` per degree.\n    *   Since `C_N_beta_B = 0.001 > 0`, Airplane B is **directionally stable**.\n\n3.  **For Airplane C:**\n    *   At `beta = 0^\\circ`, `C_n = 0`\n    *   At `beta = 5^\\circ`, `C_n = -0.01`\n    *   `C_N_beta_C = (-0.01 - 0) / (5^\\circ - 0^\\circ) = -0.01 / 5 = -0.002` per degree.\n    *   Since `C_N_beta_C = -0.002 < 0`, Airplane C is **directionally unstable**.\n\nComparing the stability of A and B:\n*   `C_N_beta_A = 0.002`\n*   `C_N_beta_B = 0.001`\nSince `C_N_beta_A > C_N_beta_B`, Airplane A is more stable than Airplane B.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'Airplane C is unstable, A and B are stable with A being more stable than B' is true."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the definition of directional static stability. An aircraft is directionally statically stable if, when disturbed by a sideslip angle ($\\beta$), it generates a restoring yawing moment that tends to reduce $\\beta$ back to zero. This condition is mathematically expressed as a positive derivative of the yawing moment coefficient ($C_N$) with respect to the sideslip angle ($\\beta$), i.e., $C_{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{dC_N}{d\\beta} > 0$. A positive sideslip angle ($\\beta > 0$, wind from the right) must generate a positive yawing moment coefficient ($C_N$, nose turns right) to restore the heading.",
        "For each airplane (A, B, C), calculate the approximate value of $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ using the given tabulated data. Since the data provides $C_N$ at discrete $\\beta$ values, use the finite difference approximation: $C_{N_{\\beta}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C_N}{\\Delta \\beta}$. Use the change from $\\beta = 0^\\circ$ to $\\beta = 5^\\circ$ for this calculation.",
        "Step 3: Calculate $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ for Airplane A:\n    $\\Delta C_N = C_N(5^\\circ) - C_N(0^\\circ) = 0.01 - 0 = 0.01$\n    $\\Delta \\beta = 5^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 5^\\circ$\n    $C_{N_{\\beta}, A} = \\frac{0.01}{5^\\circ} = 0.002$ per degree.",
        "Step 4: Calculate $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ for Airplane B:\n    $\\Delta C_N = C_N(5^\\circ) - C_N(0^\\circ) = 0.005 - 0 = 0.005$\n    $\\Delta \\beta = 5^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 5^\\circ$\n    $C_{N_{\\beta}, B} = \\frac{0.005}{5^\\circ} = 0.001$ per degree.",
        "Step 5: Calculate $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ for Airplane C:\n    $\\Delta C_N = C_N(5^\\circ) - C_N(0^\\circ) = -0.01 - 0 = -0.01$\n    $\\Delta \\beta = 5^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 5^\\circ$\n    $C_{N_{\\beta}, C} = \\frac{-0.01}{5^\\circ} = -0.002$ per degree.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate the stability of each airplane based on the sign of $C_{N_{\\beta}}$:\n    *   Airplane A: $C_{N_{\\beta}, A} = 0.002 > 0 \\implies$ Stable.\n    *   Airplane B: $C_{N_{\\beta}, B} = 0.001 > 0 \\implies$ Stable.\n    *   Airplane C: $C_{N_{\\beta}, C} = -0.002 < 0 \\implies$ Unstable.",
        "Step 7: Compare the stability levels of airplanes A and B. Since both are stable, the one with a larger positive $C_{N_{\\beta}}$ value is considered more stable. $C_{N_{\\beta}, A} = 0.002$ and $C_{N_{\\beta}, B} = 0.001$. As $0.002 > 0.001$, Airplane A is more stable than Airplane B.",
        "Step 8: Match the findings with the given options. The conclusion that 'Airplane C is unstable, A and B are stable with A being more stable than B' aligns with Option C."
