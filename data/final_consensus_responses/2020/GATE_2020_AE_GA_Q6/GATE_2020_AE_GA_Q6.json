The sub-prime lending crisis led to the banking crisis in 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The sub-prime lending refers to the provision of loans to those borrowers who may have difficulties in repaying loans, and it arises because of excess liquidity following the East Asian crisis.\n\nWhich one of the following sequences shows the correct precedence as per the given passage?",

The global financial crisis in 2008 is the overarching event, which started with the sub-prime lending crisis and included the banking crisis.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological sequence, as per the passage, is: East Asian crisis → sub-prime lending crisis → banking crisis → global financial crisis.
