This pair is used to connect two grammatically parallel elements ('of theft' and 'of conspiracy') and emphasize that both are true. Options like 'rather', 'but even', and 'rather than' do not form the correct correlative pair with 'not only' and do not convey the intended meaning of connecting two equally emphasized elements.

        "Confirm that the completed sentence, 'He was not only accused of theft but also of conspiracy,' is grammatically correct and logically coherent, conveying that the person was accused of both actions."
