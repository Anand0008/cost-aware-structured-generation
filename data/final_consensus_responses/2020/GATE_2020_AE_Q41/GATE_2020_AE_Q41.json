      "Fluid Mechanics": "The concepts of density, velocity, and pressure are fundamental to understanding lift generation, downwash, and the aerodynamic forces acting on a wing. Specifically, the concept of induced drag and its relationship to the trailing vortex system are fundamental principles in fluid mechanics.",
