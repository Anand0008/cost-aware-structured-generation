      "reasoning": "The core principle for this problem is that if a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system is vibrating *only* in a single normal mode, then its displacement vector at any instant (including initial displacement) must be directly proportional to that mode shape. Given the initial displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [x_1(0); x_2(0)] = [2; 1.24]$ cm and the first mode shape $\\phi_1 = [1; a]^T$, we can set up the proportionality: $\\mathbf{x}(0) = C \\cdot \\phi_1$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality. This leads to the equations: $x_1(0) = C \\cdot 1$ and $x_2(0) = C \\cdot a$. From the first equation, $C = x_1(0) = 2$. Substituting $C=2$ into the second equation gives $1.24 = 2a$, which yields $a = 1.24 / 2 = 0.62$. Rounding to two decimal places, $a = 0.62$. This value falls within the correct answer range of 0.61 to 0.63."

        "Step 1: Identify the given information. The system is a 2-DOF spring-mass system. Initial displacements are $x_1(0) = 2$ cm and $x_2(0) = 1.24$ cm. The system vibrates *only* in its first mode, and the first mode shape is given as $\\phi_1 = [1 \\ a]^T$.",
        "Step 2: Understand the principle of normal mode vibration: If a multi-degree-of-freedom system vibrates purely in one of its normal modes, then the displacement vector at any time (including initial) must be directly proportional to that specific mode shape. This means the ratio of displacements of the individual degrees of freedom will be constant and equal to the ratio of the corresponding components in the mode shape.",
        "Step 3: Formulate the proportionality equation using the initial conditions. The initial displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [x_1(0); x_2(0)]$ must be proportional to $\\phi_1$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = C \\cdot \\phi_1$, where $C$ is a scalar constant.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the given values into the proportionality equation: $[2; 1.24] = C \\cdot [1; a]$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the resulting system of equations. From the first component, $2 = C \\cdot 1$, which implies $C = 2$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the value of $C$ into the second component equation: $1.24 = C \\cdot a \\implies 1.24 = 2 \\cdot a$.",
        "Step 7: Calculate $a$: $a = 1.24 / 2 = 0.62$. The result is already in two decimal places."

        "description": "If the mode shape was not given, one would first need to derive the mass matrix $[M]$ and stiffness matrix $[K]$ for the system. Then, solve the eigenvalue problem $([K] - \\omega^2 [M]) \\phi = \\mathbf{0}$ to find the natural frequencies (eigenvalues $\\omega^2$) and corresponding mode shapes (eigenvectors $\\phi$). Once the mode shape is found, the problem can proceed. This involves setting up equations of motion, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides a complete understanding of the system's dynamic characteristics, including all natural frequencies and mode shapes. Cons: More computationally intensive, time-consuming, and algebraically longer; often unnecessary for specific problems where mode shapes are given, increasing the risk of mistakes under exam time pressure.",
        "when_to_use": "When the natural frequencies and mode shapes are unknown and need to be determined from the system's physical properties (masses and stiffnesses), or when the problem does not specify motion in a single mode and initial conditions might excite multiple modes."
