      "reasoning": "The given eigenvalues for the phugoid mode are $\\lambda_{1,2} = -0.02 \\pm i 0.25$. These are in the standard form $\\lambda = \\sigma \\pm i \\omega_d$, where $\\sigma = -0.02$ rad/s is the damping coefficient and $\\omega_d = 0.25$ rad/s is the damped natural frequency. The undamped natural frequency $\\Omega_n$ is calculated as $\\Omega_n = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\omega_d^2}$. Substituting the values, $\\Omega_n = \\sqrt{(-0.02)^2 + (0.25)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0004 + 0.0625} = \\sqrt{0.0629} \\approx 0.250798$ rad/s. For the phugoid mode in stable cruise flight at low angle of attack, a commonly used approximation for the natural frequency is $\\Omega_n = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_0}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $U_0$ is the equilibrium speed. Rearranging this formula to solve for $U_0$: $U_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{\\Omega_n}$. Substituting $g = 9.8$ m/s$^2$ and the calculated $\\Omega_n$: $U_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 9.8}{0.250798} \\approx \\frac{13.8595}{0.250798} \\approx 55.26$ m/s. Rounding to two decimal places gives 55.26 m/s, which falls within the acceptable range of 55.20 to 55.33 m/s."

They extract phugoid eigenvalues from the response data to verify that the measured natural frequency and damping match design specifications and to confirm the aircraft's cruise speed.",
