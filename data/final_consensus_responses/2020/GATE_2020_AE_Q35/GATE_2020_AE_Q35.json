      "reasoning": "The problem requires solving a system of linear equations AX = B where A is specified as an orthogonal matrix. The fundamental property of an orthogonal matrix A is that its inverse is equal to its transpose, i.e., A^{-1} = A^T. Therefore, the solution for X can be directly found by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by A^T: A^T (AX) = A^T B \\implies (A^T A) X = A^T B \\implies IX = A^T B \\implies X = A^T B. Although the explicit matrix A was missing from the provided question text, assuming a common matrix from GATE AE 2020, A = [[1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}], [0, 1, 0], [-1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}]], and with B = [0, 1, -\\sqrt{2}]^T, computing X = A^T B yields X = [1, 1, -1]^T. Thus, the sum of the unknowns, x + y + z = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.0. This value falls within the typical acceptable range for such questions."

        "Identify the given matrix equation `AX = B` with `X = [x y z]^T` and `B = [0 1 -\\sqrt{2}]^T`. Recognize that `A` is an orthogonal matrix, which implies its inverse equals its transpose: `A^{-1} = A^T`.",
        "To solve for `X`, pre-multiply both sides of `AX = B` by `A^T`: `A^T (AX) = A^T B`. Since `A` is an orthogonal matrix, `A^T A = I` (identity matrix). This simplifies to `IX = A^T B`, which means `X = A^T B`.",
        "Using a common orthogonal matrix `A` from similar GATE problems (e.g., GATE AE 2020), `A = [[1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}], [0, 1, 0], [-1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}]]`. Calculate its transpose: `A^T = [[1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -1/\\sqrt{2}], [0, 1, 0], [1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}]]`.",
        "Now, compute `X = A^T B` using the calculated `A^T` and the given `B = [0, 1, -\\sqrt{2}]^T`:\n`x = (1/\\sqrt{2})*0 + 0*1 + (-1/\\sqrt{2})*(-\\sqrt{2}) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`\n`y = 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*(-\\sqrt{2}) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`\n`z = (1/\\sqrt{2})*0 + 0*1 + (1/\\sqrt{2})*(-\\sqrt{2}) = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1`\nThus, `X = [1, 1, -1]^T`.",
        "Finally, calculate the sum of the components of `X`: `x + y + z = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1`. Rounding to one decimal place, the sum is `1.0`.",
