Calculate the magnitude of the total velocity vector ($V$):\n    $V = \\sqrt{u^2 + v^2 + w^2} = \\sqrt{100^2 + (-10)^2 + 20^2}$\n    $V = \\sqrt{10000 + 100 + 400} = \\sqrt{10500} \\approx 102.46950766$ m/s\n\n2.  Calculate the sideslip angle in radians:\n    $\\beta_{rad} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{-10}{102.46950766}\\right) = \\arcsin(-0.09759000) \\approx -0.0977809$ radians\n\n3.

Round off to two decimal places:\n    $\\beta \\approx -5.60$ degrees\n\nNote: Some textbooks define $\\beta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{u^2+w^2}}\\right)$, which yields approximately -5.61 degrees.
