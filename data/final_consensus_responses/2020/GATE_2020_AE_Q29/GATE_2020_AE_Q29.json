      "reasoning": "The problem involves calculating the deflection of a stepped cantilever beam under a point load at its free end. The most straightforward methods for this are the Moment-Area Method or the Unit Load Method (also known as Virtual Work Method). Both methods yield the same result. \n\nUsing the Unit Load Method (or Virtual Work Method):\n1.  **Actual Bending Moment (M(x))**: Let 'x' be the distance measured from the free end. The bending moment at any section 'x' due to the applied load 'P' is $M(x) = -P \\cdot x$. (Negative sign indicates hogging moment for a downward load).\n2.  **Virtual Bending Moment (m(x))**: To find the deflection at the free end, apply a unit virtual load (P'=1) at the free end. The virtual bending moment at any section 'x' is $m(x) = -1 \\cdot x$.\n3.  **Deflection Formula**: The deflection $\\delta$ at the free end is given by $\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{M(x) m(x)}{EI(x)} dx$.\n    Substituting $M(x)$ and $m(x)$: $\\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{(-Px)(-x)}{EI(x)} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{Px^2}{EI(x)} dx$.\n4.  **Integrate over Sections**: The beam has two sections with different moments of inertia:\n    *   Section 1: From $x=0$ to $x=2m$, $EI(x) = EI$.\n    *   Section 2: From $x=2m$ to $x=3m$ (total length is 2m + 1m = 3m), $EI(x) = 3EI$.\n    So, $\\delta = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{Px^2}{EI} dx + \\int_{2}^{3} \\frac{Px^2}{3EI} dx$\n5.  **Calculate Integral for Section 1**: \n    $\\delta_1 = \\frac{P}{EI} \\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = \\frac{P}{EI} [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{0}^{2} = \\frac{P}{EI} (\\frac{2^3}{3} - 0) = \\frac{8P}{3EI}$\n6.  **Calculate Integral for Section 2**: \n    $\\delta_2 = \\frac{P}{3EI} \\int_{2}^{3} x^2 dx = \\frac{P}{3EI} [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{2}^{3} = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{3^3}{3} - \\frac{2^3}{3}) = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{P}{3EI} (\\frac{19}{3}) = \\frac{19P}{9EI}$\n7.  **Total Deflection**: \n    $\\delta = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = \\frac{8P}{3EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{24P}{9EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{43P}{9EI}$\n8.  **Substitute Load Value**: The image specifies the load $P = 3N$. \n    $\\delta = \\frac{43 \\times 3}{9EI} = \\frac{129}{9EI} = \\frac{43}{3EI}$\n\nThis result matches option C."

        "Step 1: Identify the beam configuration, loading, and material properties. The beam is a stepped cantilever with a point load P at the free end. The total length is 3 m. Define a coordinate x measured from the free end towards the fixed end. So, x=0 at the free end and x=3m at the fixed end. The section from x=0 to x=2m has flexural rigidity EI, and the section from x=2m to x=3m has flexural rigidity 3EI. The load P is 3N.",
        "Step 2: Determine the actual bending moment M(x) along the beam. For a point load P at the free end (x=0), the bending moment at any section x (measured from the free end) is M(x) = -P * x (hogging moment).",
        "Step 3: Apply the Unit Load Method (Virtual Work Principle). To find the deflection at the free end, apply a unit virtual load P'=1 at the free end. The virtual bending moment m(x) at any section x (measured from the free end) is m(x) = -1 * x.",
        "Step 4: Set up the integral for total deflection using the Unit Load Method: \\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{M(x) m(x)}{EI(x)} dx. Substitute M(x) = -Px and m(x) = -x: \\delta = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{(-Px)(-x)}{EI(x)} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{Px^2}{EI(x)} dx",
        "Step 5: Split the integral into two parts based on the varying moment of inertia. For 0 \\le x \\le 2m (from free end), EI(x) = EI. For 2m < x \\le 3m (from free end), EI(x) = 3EI. So, \\delta = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{Px^2}{EI} dx + \\int_{2}^{3} \\frac{Px^2}{3EI} dx",
        "Step 6: Evaluate each integral. The first integral yields \\frac{8P}{3EI}. The second integral yields \\frac{19P}{9EI}.",
        "Step 7: Sum the contributions from both sections to find the total deflection: \\delta = \\frac{8P}{3EI} + \\frac{19P}{9EI} = \\frac{24P + 19P}{9EI} = \\frac{43P}{9EI}.",
        "Step 8: Substitute the numerical value of the load P = 3N into the total deflection formula: \\delta = \\frac{43 \\times 3}{9EI} = \\frac{129}{9EI} = \\frac{43}{3EI}."

        "description": "This method uses the properties of the M/EI diagram. First, draw the bending moment diagram M(x) and construct the M/EI diagram using the appropriate EI for each segment. The change in slope between two points is the area of the M/EI diagram between those points (First Moment-Area Theorem). The tangential deviation (deflection) of one point relative to the tangent at another point is the moment of the M/EI diagram between those points about the point where deflection is desired (Second Moment-Area Theorem). For a cantilever, the tangent at the fixed end is horizontal, simplifying calculations. The M/EI diagram can be treated as composed of simple geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles, trapezoids) for easier area and centroid calculations. Boundary conditions at the fixed end and continuity at the step must be enforced.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Often faster and more visual for piecewise constant EI; reduces integration to area and centroid calculations, avoiding direct integration of differential equations. More intuitive for visualizing the M/EI diagram. Cons: Can be complex for beams with many load types or varying EI if the M/EI diagram becomes very irregular. Requires careful calculation of areas and centroids and comfort with geometric decomposition; can be confusing if M/EI diagram is complex.",
        "when_to_use": "Excellent for cantilevers and simply supported beams with concentrated loads or moments, especially when EI is piecewise constant and the bending moment diagram has simple shapes. Particularly useful in exam settings where quick geometric calculations are preferred over repeated integration."

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Fundamental and robust. Provides the entire elastic curve. Cons: Can be cumbersome for stepped beams as it requires separate differential equations and integration constants for each section, with continuity conditions at the junctions. More prone to algebraic errors.",
