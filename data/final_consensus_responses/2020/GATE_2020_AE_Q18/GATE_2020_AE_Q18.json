      "reasoning": "For a uniform cantilever beam undergoing transverse vibration, governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$) for the $n$-th mode is given by the general relationship: $\\omega_n = \\frac{(\\beta_n L)^2}{L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$. Here, $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the area moment of inertia, $\\rho$ is the material density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $(\\beta_n L)$ is an eigenvalue parameter specific to the mode number ($n$) and boundary conditions. For a cantilever beam, $(\\beta_1 L)$ for the first mode is a constant (approximately 1.875). Since the material ($E, \\rho$) and cross-section ($I, A$) remain the same, the term $\\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$ is constant. Also, $(\\beta_n L)^2$ is constant for the first mode. Therefore, the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ is inversely proportional to the square of the beam's length ($L^2$), i.e., $\\omega_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$.\n\nLet the initial natural frequency be $\\omega_1 = \\omega$ and the initial length be $L_1 = L$. The new length is $L_2 = 2L$. We need to find the new frequency $\\omega_2$.\n\nUsing the proportionality:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{1/L_2^2}{1/L_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nTherefore, $\\omega_2 = \\frac{\\omega}{4}$."

        "Here, E is Young's modulus, I is the area moment of inertia, \\rho is the material density, A is the cross-sectional area, and (\\beta_n L) is an eigenvalue parameter determined by the boundary conditions and mode number.

        "For fixed material properties (E, \\rho) and cross-sectional properties (I, A), and for a specific mode (constant \\beta_n L), the natural frequency \\omega_n is inversely proportional to the square of the beam's length L. This can be written as \\omega \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}.",
