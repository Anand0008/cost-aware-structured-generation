      "reasoning": "The problem is solved by applying the principle of conservation of angular momentum for a two-body orbit. At perihelion (closest point) and aphelion (farthest point), the velocity vector is purely tangential, so angular momentum per unit mass (h) is conserved. This implies r_p v_p = r_a v_a, leading to v_p / v_a = r_a / r_p. For an elliptical orbit, the perihelion distance is r_p = a(1 - e) and the aphelion distance is r_a = a(1 + e). Substituting these, we get v_p / v_a = (1 + e) / (1 - e). Given v_p / v_a = 1.0339, we solve 1.0339 = (1 + e) / (1 - e) for e. This yields e = 0.0339 / 2.0339 ≈ 0.016667, which rounds to 0.017."

        "Step 1: Identify the given information and governing principle. The ratio of tangential velocities of a planet at perihelion (v_p) and aphelion (v_a) is given as 1.0339. The orbit is planar and elliptic, and the goal is to find the eccentricity (e). For a two-body elliptical orbit, angular momentum per unit mass (h) is conserved. At the apsides (perihelion and aphelion), the velocity is purely tangential. Therefore, angular momentum conservation implies r_p v_p = r_a v_a, where r_p and v_p are the perihelion distance and velocity, and r_a and v_a are the aphelion distance and velocity.",
        "Step 1: Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum for an elliptical orbit. At perihelion (p) and aphelion (a), the angular momentum per unit mass is conserved, meaning $r_p v_p = r_a v_a$. This implies that the ratio of velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of radii: $\\frac{v_p}{v_a} = \\frac{r_a}{r_p}$.",
        "Step 2: Use the given velocity ratio. The problem states $\\frac{v_p}{v_a} = 1.0339$. Therefore, from Step 1, we have $\\frac{r_a}{r_p} = 1.0339$.",
        "Step 3: Recall the formulas for perihelion and aphelion distances. For an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$, the perihelion distance is $r_p = a(1 - e)$ and the aphelion distance is $r_a = a(1 + e)$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute these distance formulas into the ratio from Step 2. $\\frac{r_a}{r_p} = \\frac{a(1 + e)}{a(1 - e)} = \\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}$.",
        "Step 5: Equate the derived ratio to the given velocity ratio: $\\frac{1 + e}{1 - e} = 1.0339$.",
        "Step 6: Solve the equation for eccentricity $e$.\n$1 + e = 1.0339(1 - e)$\n$1 + e = 1.0339 - 1.0339e$\n$e + 1.0339e = 1.0339 - 1$\n$2.0339e = 0.0339$\n$e = \\frac{0.0339}{2.0339} \\approx 0.016667$",
