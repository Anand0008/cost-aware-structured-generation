      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the exit velocity of an ideal ramjet engine. Given the stagnation temperature at the combustor exit ($T_{02}$), the specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), and the gas constant ($R$), the calculation of exit velocity ($V_{exit}$) requires either the exit Mach number ($M_{exit}$) or the static temperature at the exit ($T_{exit}$). For an ideal ramjet operating at its design point, it is assumed that the flow expands to the flight Mach number at the nozzle exit, i.e., $M_{exit} = M_0 = 2.8$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the static temperature at the nozzle exit ($T_{exit}$):**\n    Using the isentropic flow relation for temperature:\n    $T_{exit} = T_{02} / (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{exit}^2)$\n    $T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} (2.8)^2)$\n    $T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + 0.2 \\times 7.84)$\n    $T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / (1 + 1.568)$\n    $T_{exit} = 2400 \\text{ K} / 2.568 \\approx 934.5093 \\text{ K}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the speed of sound at the exit ($a_{exit}$):**\n    $a_{exit} = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_{exit}}$\n    $a_{exit} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J/(kg K)} \\times 934.5093 \\text{ K}}$\n    $a_{exit} = \\sqrt{375354.00} \\approx 612.6613 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the exit velocity ($V_{exit}$):**\n    $V_{exit} = M_{exit} \\times a_{exit}$\n    $V_{exit} = 2.8 \\times 612.6613 \\text{ m/s} \\approx 1715.4516 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, the velocity of air at the exit of the engine is $1715.5 \\text{ m/s}$. This value falls within the typical acceptable range for such problems (e.g., 1712.0 to 1719.0 m/s)."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify given parameters: Flight Mach number $M_0 = 2.8$, stagnation temperature at combustor exit $T_{t4} = 2400 \\, \\text{K}$, specific heat ratio $\\gamma = 1.4$, gas constant $R = 287 \\, \\text{J/(kg K)}$. (Note: $T_{t4}$ is equivalent to $T_{02}$ or $T_{04}$ in some notations for the combustor exit stagnation temperature).",
        "Step 2: Compute specific heat at constant pressure: $C_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1.4 \\times 287}{0.4} = 1004.5 \\, \\text{J/(kg K)}$.",
        "Step 3: For an ideal ramjet, nozzle expansion is isentropic to ambient pressure. The static temperature at exit is related to stagnation temperature by isentropic relation: $\\frac{T_{exit}}{T_{t4}} = \\left(\\frac{p_{exit}}{p_{t4}}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$. Since $p_{t4} = p_{t0}$ (constant pressure combustion) and $p_{exit} = p_0$ (perfect expansion), the pressure ratio simplifies to $\\frac{p_{exit}}{p_{t4}} = \\frac{1}{[1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2]^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}}$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the static temperature at the nozzle exit, assuming perfect expansion such that the exit static temperature is related to the combustor exit stagnation temperature by the flight Mach number: $T_{exit} = \\frac{T_{t4}}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2}$. Calculate $\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2 = 0.2 \\times (2.8)^2 = 1.568$, so $1 + 1.568 = 2.568$. Then $T_{exit} = 2400 / 2.568 = 934.5794 \\, \\text{K}$.",
        "Step 5: Apply energy conservation across the nozzle (adiabatic): $h_{t4} = h_{exit} + \\frac{V_{exit}^2}{2}$, which for an ideal gas simplifies to $C_p T_{t4} = C_p T_{exit} + \\frac{V_{exit}^2}{2}$. Solve for exit velocity: $V_{exit} = \\sqrt{2 C_p (T_{t4} - T_{exit})}$.",
        "Step 6: Compute the temperature difference: $\\Delta T = T_{t4} - T_{exit} = 2400 - 934.5794 = 1465.4206 \\, \\text{K}$. Then calculate the exit velocity: $V_{exit} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 1004.5 \\times 1465.4206} \\approx \\sqrt{2,944,029.9854} \\approx 1715.8 \\, \\text{m/s}$.",
