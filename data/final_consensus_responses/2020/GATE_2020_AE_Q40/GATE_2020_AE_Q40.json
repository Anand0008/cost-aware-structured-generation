Computing Re_x = Ux/ν = (3 m/s * 0.5 m) / (1.5e-5 m²/s) = 100,000. Then √Re_x ≈ 316.2278, so δ/x = 5.2/316.2278 ≈ 0.016446, thus δ = 0.016446 * 0.5 m = 0.008223 m. Therefore, δ* = δ/2 = 0.0041115 m = 4.1115 mm, which rounds to 4.11 mm and falls within the provided range of 4.00 to 4.20 mm. The answer key is correct."
