      "reasoning": "The drag force on the airfoil is determined by the momentum deficit in the wake. Using the control volume approach with uniform static pressure at upstream (Section A) and downstream (Section B) sections, the drag D per unit span for a 2D airfoil is given by the momentum integral equation: D = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho u(y) (U_0 - u(y)) dy. From the image, the velocity profile at section B is u(y) = 0.995 U_0 over a height c and u(y) = U_0 elsewhere. Substituting this into the integral: D = \\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} \\rho (0.995 U_0) (U_0 - 0.995 U_0) dy = \\rho (0.995 U_0) (0.005 U_0) \\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} dy = \\rho (0.995 U_0) (0.005 U_0) c = \\rho U_0^2 (0.004975) c. The 2D drag coefficient C_D is defined as C_D = \\frac{D}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_0^2 c}. Substituting the expression for D: C_D = \\frac{\\rho U_0^2 (0.004975) c}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_0^2 c} = 2 \\times 0.004975 = 0.00995. Rounding to three decimal places, C_D = 0.010.
