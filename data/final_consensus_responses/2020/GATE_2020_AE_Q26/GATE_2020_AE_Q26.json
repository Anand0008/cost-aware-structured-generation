Multiply by `dy` to separate variables: `x dx = (c - y) dy`.\n3.  Integrate both sides: `∫ x dx = ∫ (c - y) dy`.\n4.  Perform the integration: `x^2/2 = cy - y^2/2 + K`, where `K` is the integration constant.\n5.  Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear denominators: `x^2 = 2cy - y^2 + 2K`.\n6.  Rearrange the terms to group `x` and `y` terms: `x^2 + y^2 - 2cy = 2K`.\n7.  To identify the curve, complete the square for the `y` terms. Add `c^2` to both sides: `x^2 + (y^2 - 2cy + c^2) = 2K + c^2`.\n8.  This simplifies to: `x^2 + (y - c)^2 = (2K + c^2)`.\n9.  Let `R^2 = 2K + c^2` (where `R` is a constant representing the radius). The equation becomes `x^2 + (y - c)^2 = R^2`.\nThis is the standard equation of a circle with its center at `(0, c)` and radius `R`. Therefore, the equation represents a family of circles."
