      "reasoning": "The problem describes an airplane performing a pull-up maneuver at the bottom of a vertical circle. At this point, the lift force ($L$) acts upwards, and the weight ($W$) acts downwards. The net upward force provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion.\n\n1.  **Convert Speed to SI Units**: The given speed is $V = 360 \\text{ km/h}$. To use it in calculations with meters and seconds, convert it to m/s:\n    $V = 360 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ km}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ h}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 100 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Newton's Second Law**: At the bottom of the vertical circle, the forces acting are the lift force ($L$) upwards and the weight ($W$) downwards. The net force towards the center of the circle (upwards) provides the centripetal force ($F_c$).\n    $\\sum F_{\\text{vertical}} = L - W$\n    The centripetal force is given by $F_c = m a_c = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$, where $m$ is the mass of the airplane, $V$ is its speed, and $R$ is the radius of the circle.\n    Therefore, $L - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$.\n\n3.  **Introduce Load Factor**: The load factor ($n$) is defined as the ratio of lift to weight: $n = \\frac{L}{W}$. From this, we can write $L = nW$.\n\n4.  **Derive Load Factor Formula**: Substitute $L = nW$ into the force equation:\n    $nW - W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Factor out $W$:\n    $(n - 1)W = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Since $W = mg$ (where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity), substitute this into the equation:\n    $(n - 1)mg = m \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Cancel out the mass ($m$) from both sides:\n    $(n - 1)g = \\frac{V^2}{R}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $n$:\n    $n - 1 = \\frac{V^2}{gR}$\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{V^2}{gR}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute Numerical Values**: Given $V = 100 \\text{ m/s}$, $R = 400 \\text{ m}$, and $g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$:\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{(100 \\text{ m/s})^2}{(9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2)(400 \\text{ m})}$\n    $n = 1 + \\frac{10000}{3920}$\n    $n = 1 + 2.5510204...$\n    $n = 3.5510204...$\n\n6.  **Round Off**: Rounding off to two decimal places as requested:\n    $n \\approx 3.55$.\n\nThis calculated value of 3.55 falls within the acceptable range of 3.50 to 3.60."

Avoid by understanding the distinct force balances for horizontal vs. vertical turns.\n2. **Incorrect force balance:** Forgetting the '+1' term in $n = 1 + V^2/(gR)$ or writing L = mV²/R. Avoid by always starting with the fundamental force balance ($L - W = m a_c$) and drawing a free-body diagram. The '1' accounts for the static load due to weight.\n3. **Unit conversion errors:** Forgetting to convert speed from km/h to m/s. Avoid by always double-checking units and converting early (e.g., 360 km/h = 100 m/s).\n4. **Premature rounding:** Rounding off intermediate calculations too early. Avoid by carrying at least 4-5 decimal places in intermediate steps and only rounding the final answer to the specified precision.",

Apply Newton's second law in the vertical direction (L - W = m a_c), substitute the centripetal acceleration a_c = V^2/R and weight W = mg, and then use the definition of load factor n = L/W to derive the formula step-by-step. Alternatively, the load factor can also be derived from an energy balance perspective, equating the rate of change of kinetic energy to the work done by the lift and weight forces, which is particularly useful for analyzing the entire vertical circle.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Reinforces conceptual understanding, reduces reliance on rote memorization, and is more robust for varying problem contexts (e.g., top of the loop or at an angle). The energy method provides full motion analysis. Cons: Both methods can take longer than direct formula application and the energy method is generally more complex for just a single point calculation.",
        "when_to_use": "Recommended if you are unsure about the specific formula for a given maneuver, if the problem involves a variation of the standard scenario (e.g., top or other points in the loop), or if speed varies due to gravity. It's a good practice for building strong fundamental understanding."
