      "reasoning": "For a bar subjected to a pure axial tensile force, the normal stress ($\\sigma$) is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area ($A$) and is given by the fundamental formula $\\sigma = P/A$, where $P$ is the applied axial force. Yielding occurs when this normal stress reaches the material's yield strength ($\\sigma_y$). Therefore, the yielding force ($F_{yield}$) can be expressed as $F_{yield} = \\sigma_y \\times A$. The problem statement specifies that all three bars (circular, triangular, and rectangular) are made of the same material (aluminum), which means they all possess the same intrinsic material property, the yield strength ($\\sigma_y$). Crucially, it also states that they have the 'same cross sectional area' ($A$). Since both the yield strength ($\\sigma_y$) and the cross-sectional area ($A$) are identical for all three bars, the force required to initiate yielding ($F_{yield}$) must also be identical for all of them, regardless of their specific cross-sectional shape. The shape of the cross-section becomes critical for other loading conditions like bending (moment of inertia) or torsion (polar moment of inertia), or for stability issues like buckling, but not for pure axial stress and yielding when the area is constant. Thus, $F_{circle} = F_{triangle} = F_{rectangle}$."
