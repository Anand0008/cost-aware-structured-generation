      "reasoning": "The question asks which option increases the Mach number of an already supersonic flow in a duct. To answer this, we must consider the principles of compressible flow, specifically Rayleigh flow (heat transfer), Fanno flow (friction), and Isentropic flow (area change).\n\n1.  **A. Increasing the length of the duct:** This scenario is governed by Fanno flow, which describes adiabatic flow with friction in a constant-area duct. For supersonic flow, friction causes the Mach number to decrease, approaching Mach 1 (choking). Therefore, increasing the length of the duct will cause the Mach number to decrease.\n\n2.  **B. Adding heat to the flow:** This scenario is governed by Rayleigh flow, which describes frictionless flow with heat transfer in a constant-area duct. For supersonic flow, adding heat causes the Mach number to decrease, moving towards Mach 1 (thermal choking). This is a critical concept in high-speed propulsion.\n\n3.  **C. Removing heat from the flow:** This is the inverse of adding heat in Rayleigh flow. If adding heat to supersonic flow decreases the Mach number, then removing heat (cooling) from supersonic flow will cause its Mach number to increase, moving it further away from Mach 1 on the supersonic branch of the Rayleigh curve. This is the correct option.\n\n4.  **D. Inserting a convergent-divergent section with the same cross-sectional area at its inlet and exit planes:** For isentropic supersonic flow, a converging duct causes the Mach number to decrease, while a diverging duct causes it to increase. If a convergent-divergent (CD) section has the same inlet and exit areas, and the flow remains isentropic, the Mach number at the exit would return to its original value. This option does not guarantee a net increase in Mach number and could also lead to shock formation, which would decelerate the flow. Thus, it is not a reliable way to increase the Mach number."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the flow regime and relevant theories. The flow is supersonic in a duct. Changes in Mach number can be analyzed using: Rayleigh flow (constant area with heat addition/removal), Fanno flow (constant area with friction), and Isentropic flow with area change. The goal is to find an option that *increases* the Mach number.",
        "Step 2: Recall the principles of compressible flow, specifically Rayleigh flow for heat addition/removal and Fanno flow for friction. For supersonic flow in a constant-area duct, adding heat decreases the Mach number towards 1, while removing heat increases the Mach number away from 1.",
        "Step 3: Analyze Option A (Increasing the length of the duct). This relates to Fanno flow (adiabatic flow with friction). For supersonic flow in a constant-area duct, friction causes the Mach number to decrease towards 1. Therefore, increasing the duct length will decrease the Mach number.",
        "Step 4: Analyze Option B (Adding heat to the flow). This relates to Rayleigh flow. For supersonic flow (M > 1), adding heat causes the Mach number to decrease, approaching Mach 1. Thus, adding heat will not increase the Mach number.",
        "Step 5: Analyze Option C (Removing heat from the flow). In Rayleigh flow, removing heat from a supersonic flow causes the Mach number to increase, moving it further into the supersonic regime (away from Mach 1). This is the correct option.",
        "Step 6: Analyze Option D (Inserting a convergent-divergent section). For supersonic isentropic flow, a converging section decelerates the flow, and a diverging section accelerates it. If a convergent-divergent section has the same inlet and exit areas, the Mach number at the exit will be the same as the inlet Mach number, assuming isentropic flow. The net effect is not a guaranteed increase in Mach number, and the presence of shocks would further decrease it.",
        "Step 7: Conclude that based on the analysis of Rayleigh, Fanno, and isentropic area change effects, removing heat from a supersonic flow is the only option that consistently increases the Mach number."

        "industry_example": "In a scramjet engine, fuel combustion adds significant heat to a supersonic airflow. This heat addition naturally tends to decrease the Mach number, risking thermal choking (flow decelerating to Mach 1). To counteract this and maintain supersonic combustion, the combustor is often designed with a slightly diverging cross-section, which helps accelerate the supersonic flow.",
        "why_it_matters": "Maintaining supersonic combustion is essential for scramjet efficiency and achieving high thrust for hypersonic flight. Failure to manage heat addition effects can lead to thermal choking, causing normal shocks, large pressure rises, reduced efficiency, and potential engine unstart or flameout, compromising performance and safety."

For a given total enthalpy, the Rayleigh line illustrates how flow properties change with heat addition or removal. The peak of the curve represents Mach 1. In supersonic flow, adding heat moves the state along the Rayleigh line towards the sonic point (M=1), thus decreasing Mach number. Conversely, removing heat moves the state away from the sonic point, increasing Mach number.",
