Given the drag polar CD = 0.025 + 0.049 CL^2, the condition for max CL/CD is CD0 = K*CL^2, yielding CL_opt = sqrt(CD0/K) = sqrt(0.025/0.049) ≈ 0.7143. Using the level flight equation L = W = 0.5*ρ*V^2*S*CL and wing loading W/S = 9844 N/m², we solve for V: V = sqrt((W/S) * (2/(ρ*CL_opt))) = sqrt(9844 * (2/(1.225*0.7143))) ≈ sqrt(22500) = 150.0 m/s.

        "Step 3: Find the lift coefficient CL that maximizes CL/CD. For a parabolic drag polar, the maximum occurs when CD0 = K*CL^2. Thus, CL_opt = sqrt(CD0/K) = sqrt(0.025/0.049) = sqrt(0.5102) ≈ 0.7143.",
        "Step 4: Use the level flight equation, where Lift (L) equals Weight (W). The lift equation is L = 0.5 * ρ * V^2 * S * CL. Since W = L, we can write W/S = 0.5 * ρ * V^2 * CL.",
        "Step 5: Use the lift equation for steady, level flight ($L=W$) and the given wing loading ($W/S = 9844 \\text{ N/m}^2$). Rearrange the lift equation ($W = 0.5 \\rho V^2 S C_L$) to solve for velocity ($V$): $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (W/S)}{\\rho C_L}}$.",
