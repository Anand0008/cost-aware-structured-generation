      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the tangential velocity component of a space vehicle. In a circular orbit, the velocity is purely tangential (horizontal) to the local horizon. The burnout velocity ($V_b$) is given as 13.5 km/s, and its direction is specified as an angle ($\\beta$) of $5^\\circ$ above the local horizon. The tangential velocity ($V_t$) is the component of the total velocity vector that is parallel to the local horizontal. This can be found using basic trigonometry by resolving the velocity vector. The component adjacent to the angle with the horizontal is calculated using the cosine function. Therefore, $V_t = V_b \\cos(\\beta)$. Substituting the given values: $V_t = 13.5 \\text{ km/s} \\times \\cos(5^\\circ) = 13.5 \\times 0.996194698 \\approx 13.4486 \\text{ km/s}$.
