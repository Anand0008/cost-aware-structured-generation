      "reasoning": "Aerodynamic forces and moments are fundamentally generated by integrating the pressure and shear stress distributions over the entire wetted surface of a body. Pressure acts normal to the surface, and shear stress acts tangentially. Given the complete geometry and the distributions of pressure and shear stress, one can directly compute the total force vector and total moment vector by performing surface integrals. However, dimensionless coefficients (e.g., force coefficient, moment coefficient) require normalization by freestream dynamic pressure, reference area, and reference length, which are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, with the given data, one can estimate the dimensional force and moment on the body, but not their coefficients."

        "Understand that aerodynamic forces and moments originate from the local pressure acting normal to the surface and the local shear stress acting tangential to the surface. The problem provides complete geometry, surface pressure, and shear stress distributions over the body.",
        "Recognize that these local effects vary over the entire surface. To find the total force and moment, these differential contributions must be summed up continuously over the entire wetted surface area using surface integration.",
        "Recall the integral formula for total aerodynamic force: $\\mathbf{F} = \\iint_S (-p \\, \\mathbf{n} + \\tau_w \\, \\mathbf{t}) \\, dA$, where $p$ is local pressure, $\\tau_w$ is local shear stress, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector, $\\mathbf{t}$ is the unit tangential vector, and $dA$ is the elemental surface area. The pressure distribution contributes to the normal force, and shear stress to the tangential force.",
        "Similarly, the total aerodynamic moment $\\mathbf{M}$ about a reference point can be computed as $\\mathbf{M} = \\iint_S \\mathbf{r} \\times (-p \\, \\mathbf{n} + \\tau_w \\, \\mathbf{t}) \\, dA$, where $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector from the reference point to the elemental surface area $dA$.",
        "With the complete geometry and the distributions of pressure and shear stress, all necessary inputs for these integrals are available. Therefore, the direct outputs of these surface integrals are the dimensional total force $\\mathbf{F}$ and total moment $\\mathbf{M}$ acting on the body.",
        "Force and moment coefficients are dimensionless parameters that require normalization by freestream dynamic pressure ($q_\\infty = 0.5 \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2$) and a reference area/length. Since freestream density and velocity are not provided, the dynamic pressure cannot be determined, and thus, the coefficients cannot be estimated from the given data alone.",
