      "reasoning": "The problem describes a pair of infinitely long, counter-rotating line vortices of the same circulation strength Γ, separated by a distance h. Let's denote the left vortex as V_L and the right vortex as V_R.\n\n1.  **Assign Circulation Directions:** From the image, the left vortex (V_L) rotates counter-clockwise, which is conventionally assigned a positive circulation, +Γ. The right vortex (V_R) rotates clockwise, which is assigned a negative circulation, -Γ.\n\n2.  **Velocity Induced by a Single Vortex:** The magnitude of the velocity induced by an infinitely long line vortex of strength Γ at a perpendicular distance r is given by the Biot-Savart law for an infinite straight vortex: w = Γ/(2πr).\n\n3.  **Velocity Induced by V_L at the location of V_R:**\n    *   The perpendicular distance from V_L to V_R is r = h.\n    *   The magnitude of the velocity induced by V_L at V_R's location is w_L → R = Γ/(2πh).\n    *   Since V_L is a positive (counter-clockwise) vortex, the fluid it induces at a point to its right (where V_R is located) will be directed upwards, i.e., in the +y direction.\n\n4.  **Velocity Induced by V_R at the location of V_L:**\n    *   The perpendicular distance from V_R to V_L is also r = h.\n    *   The magnitude of the velocity induced by V_R at V_L's location is w_R → L = |-Γ|/(2πh) = Γ/(2πh).\n    *   Since V_R is a negative (clockwise) vortex, the fluid it induces at a point to its left (where V_L is located) will also be directed upwards, i.e., in the +y direction.\n\n5.  **Motion of the Vortices:** Each vortex moves with the velocity induced by the *other* vortex. A vortex does not induce velocity on itself. The induced velocities are perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex centers. Since the vortices are counter-rotating and of equal strength, the induced velocities are equal in magnitude and both directed in the +y direction.\n    *   The velocity of V_L is w_R → L = Γ/(2πh) in the +y direction.\n    *   The velocity of V_R is w_L → R = Γ/(2πh) in the +y direction.\n\nTherefore, both vortices translate together along the +y direction with a velocity of Γ/(2πh). There is no net rotation about the midpoint because the induced velocities at each vortex are parallel and equal, not centripetal about the center. This corresponds to option C."
