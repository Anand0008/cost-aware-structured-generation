The Pitot tube measures total pressure, so the dynamic pressure is found from the difference between the total and static pressures. From this, the true airspeed at altitude is calculated using the local density. Finally, the equivalent airspeed is derived from the true airspeed and the ratio of local to sea-level densities. The calculated value (e.g., 58.66 m/s) falls within the acceptable range of 57.10 to 60.00 m/s."

Pilots use IAS for critical speeds like takeoff, landing, and stall speeds because aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) depend on dynamic pressure, which is proportional to EAS squared, making these speeds consistent regardless of altitude.",
