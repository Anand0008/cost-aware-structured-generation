      "reasoning": "If all eigenvalues of an n x n matrix are real and equal (let's say to $\\lambda$), this means the algebraic multiplicity (AM) of $\\lambda$ is n. For the matrix to be diagonalizable, it must have n linearly independent eigenvectors, which requires the geometric multiplicity (GM) of $\\lambda$ to also be n. However, it is always true that GM($\\lambda$) $\\le$ AM($\\lambda$). If GM($\\lambda$) < AM($\\lambda$), the matrix does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors and is therefore not diagonalizable. A classic counterexample is a non-diagonal Jordan block matrix, such as A = [[$\\lambda$, 1], [0, $\\lambda$]]. For this 2x2 matrix, both eigenvalues are $\\lambda$ (AM=2), but it only has one linearly independent eigenvector (GM=1). Thus, the eigenvectors are *not necessarily* linearly independent. Consequently, the matrix is not necessarily diagonalizable. The determinant of the matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, so det(A) = $\\lambda^n$, which is only zero if $\\lambda = 0$, not in all cases."

        "Interpret the given condition: \"all eigenvalues of a matrix are real and equal\". For an n x n matrix, this means there is a single eigenvalue \\lambda with algebraic multiplicity n.",
        "Recall the condition for diagonalizability: An n x n matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors. This is equivalent to stating that for every eigenvalue, its geometric multiplicity (GM) must equal its algebraic multiplicity (AM).",
        "For an eigenvalue \\lambda, its geometric multiplicity (GM) is the dimension of its eigenspace, representing the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with \\lambda. We know that GM(\\lambda) \\le AM(\\lambda) always holds. Therefore, having equal eigenvalues (AM=n) does not automatically guarantee that GM=n, and thus does not guarantee n linearly independent eigenvectors.",
        "For the matrix to be diagonalizable, we need GM(\\lambda) = AM(\\lambda) = n. However, the condition \"all eigenvalues are real and equal\" (implying AM=n) does not guarantee that GM(\\lambda) = n. It is possible that GM(\\lambda) < n. A common counterexample is a Jordan block matrix, such as A = [[\\lambda, 1], [0, \\lambda]]. For this 2x2 matrix, both eigenvalues are \\lambda (AM=2), but it only has one linearly independent eigenvector (GM=1). Since GM < AM, this matrix is not diagonalizable.",
        "Based on the counterexample (Jordan block), where GM < AM, the eigenvectors are not linearly independent. This means that with equal eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are not necessarily linearly independent. Therefore, option B (\"its eigenvectors are not necessarily linearly independent\") is true, while option C (\"its eigenvectors are linearly independent\") is false.",
        "For an n x n matrix, the determinant is the product of its eigenvalues. If all eigenvalues are equal to \\lambda, then det(A) = \\lambda^n. This determinant is zero only if \\lambda = 0. Since \\lambda can be non-zero (e.g., for an identity matrix, \\lambda = 1), the determinant is not necessarily zero. Thus, option D is false.",
