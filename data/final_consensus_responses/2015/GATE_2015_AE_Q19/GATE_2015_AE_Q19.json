      "reasoning": "A vertical tail's primary function is to provide directional stability and control. It needs to generate side forces in response to sideslip, but ideally, it should not generate any side force (lift) at zero sideslip angle. To achieve this, a symmetric airfoil is required, as symmetric airfoils have zero camber and thus produce zero lift at zero angle of attack (or zero sideslip in the case of a vertical tail). Let's analyze the given options based on NACA airfoil numbering systems:\n\n*   **A. NACA 0012:** The first two digits '00' explicitly indicate zero maximum camber and zero location of maximum camber. This defines a symmetric airfoil. The '12' indicates a maximum thickness of 12% of the chord. A symmetric airfoil is perfectly suited for a vertical tail because it produces zero lift at zero angle of attack and has a symmetric lift curve, enabling equal and predictable performance in both directions.\n*   **B. NACA 2312:** This is a NACA four-digit series airfoil. The first digit '2' indicates a maximum camber of 2% of the chord, and the second digit '3' indicates the location of maximum camber at 30% (0.3c) from the leading edge. This is a cambered airfoil, designed to produce lift at zero angle of attack, which is undesirable for a vertical tail at zero sideslip.\n*   **C. NACA 23012:** This is a NACA five-digit series airfoil. The '230' part indicates a design lift coefficient of 0.3 (first digit '2' multiplied by 3/2) and the location of maximum camber at 15% (30/2) of the chord. This is also a cambered airfoil, designed for a specific lift performance, making it inappropriate for a vertical tail's primary function.\n*   **D. Clarke Y profile:** The Clarke Y is a well-known historical airfoil that is cambered, not symmetric. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a vertical tail.\n\nBased on this analysis, NACA 0012 is the only symmetric airfoil among the choices and is thus the most appropriate for a vertical tail."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the functional requirement of a vertical tail. It provides directional stability and control (yaw) by generating side force (analogous to lift) in both positive and negative sideslip angles. Ideally, it should produce no side force at zero sideslip to avoid unwanted trim forces.",
        "Based on this function, the ideal airfoil characteristic is one that produces zero lift (or side force) at zero angle of attack (or sideslip) and can generate forces equally well in both positive and negative directions. This characteristic is inherent to symmetric airfoils, which have no camber and whose lift coefficient (C_l) vs. angle of attack (α) curve is symmetric about α=0.",
        "Recall the NACA airfoil numbering system. For four-digit series (e.g., NACA 0012), the first two digits indicate camber (00 for zero camber). For five-digit series (e.g., NACA 23012), the first digit relates to the design lift coefficient, implying camber. Based on this, NACA 0012 is a symmetric airfoil (00 indicates zero camber), while NACA 2312, NACA 23012, and Clarke Y are cambered profiles.",
        "Therefore, NACA 0012 is the correct choice as it is a symmetric airfoil, indicated by the '00' in its designation, ensuring zero lift at zero sideslip and equal performance in both directions. The '12' indicates a 12% thickness-to-chord ratio, providing adequate structural integrity. The other options (NACA 2312, NACA 23012, Clarke Y) are cambered and thus unsuitable for a vertical tail's primary function.",
