Assuming a parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D,0} + K C_L^2$, we have $K C_L^2 = 0.003$ for level flight. In a steady climb at the same altitude and speed, lift $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$, so $C_{L,\\text{climb}} = C_{L,\\text{level}} \\cos(30^\\circ)$. Thus, induced drag in climb $C_{D,i,\\text{climb}} = (K C_{L,\\text{level}}^2) \\cos^2(30^\\circ) = 0.003 \\times \\cos^2(30^\\circ) = 0.003 \\times 0.75 = 0.00225$. Total drag coefficient in climb $C_{D,\\text{climb}} = C_{D,0} + C_{D,i,\\text{climb}} = 0.015 + 0.00225 = 0.01725 = 17.25 \\times 10^{-3}$, which falls within the range 17.2 to 17.3."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given data for level flight and the drag polar equation. We are given the total drag coefficient ($C_D = 0.018$) and the zero-lift drag coefficient ($C_{D,0} = 0.015$) for level flight. The drag polar equation is $C_D = C_{D,0} + K C_L^2$, where $K C_L^2$ represents the induced drag ($C_{D,i}$).",
        "Step 2: Calculate the induced drag coefficient for level flight. This is the difference between the total drag coefficient and the zero-lift drag coefficient: $C_{D,i,\\text{level}} = C_D - C_{D,0} = 0.018 - 0.015 = 0.003$.",
        "Step 3: Establish the relationship between the lift coefficient in climb ($C_{L,climb}$) and the lift coefficient in level flight ($C_{L,level}$). For steady, unaccelerated flight, lift ($L$) equals weight ($W$) in level flight, and $L = W \\cos(\\gamma)$ in climb, where $\\gamma$ is the climb angle ($30^\\circ$). Since the altitude (and thus air density $\\rho$) and speed ($V$) are the same for both conditions, the dynamic pressure ($0.5 \\rho V^2 S$) is constant. Therefore, $C_{L,climb} = C_{L,level} \\cos(\\gamma)$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the induced drag coefficient for climb ($C_{D,i,climb}$). Since $C_{D,i} = K C_L^2$, we can write $C_{D,i,climb} = K C_{L,climb}^2 = K (C_{L,level} \\cos(\\gamma))^2 = (K C_{L,level}^2) \\cos^2(\\gamma)$. From Step 2, we know $K C_{L,level}^2 = C_{D,i,level}$. Thus, $C_{D,i,climb} = C_{D,i,level} \\cos^2(\\gamma) = 0.003 \\times \\cos^2(30^\\circ)$.",
        "Step 5: Compute the numerical value for the induced drag coefficient in climb. Calculate $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866$, so $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = 3/4 = 0.75$. Therefore, $C_{D,i,climb} = 0.003 \\times 0.75 = 0.00225$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the total drag coefficient for climb ($C_{D,climb}$). Using the drag polar equation, $C_{D,climb} = C_{D,0} + C_{D,i,climb} = 0.015 + 0.00225 = 0.01725$.",
        "Step 7: Express the final answer in the required format ($x \\times 10^{-3}$). The calculated drag coefficient is $0.01725$, which can be written as $17.25 \\times 10^{-3}$.",
