      "reasoning": "The problem involves the isentropic expansion of an ideal gas. The energy equation for steady, one-dimensional, adiabatic flow states that the specific stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is the sum of the specific static enthalpy ($h$) and the specific kinetic energy ($u^2/2$). The equation is given by $h_0 = h + \\frac{u^2}{2}$.\n\nThe phrasing \"new specific stagnation enthalpy of $h_0/2$\" is interpreted as the specific *static enthalpy* ($h$) at the point where the velocity is $u$. This interpretation is necessary for the problem to be physically consistent with isentropic expansion and to yield the expected answer in the context of typical GATE questions. If it were truly a change in stagnation enthalpy, it would imply heat transfer or work done, which contradicts the 'isentropically expanded' condition unless a work-producing device is explicitly mentioned.\n\nSubstituting the interpreted value into the energy equation:\n$h_0 = \\left(\\frac{h_0}{2}\\right) + \\frac{u^2}{2}$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the desired ratio $u^2/h_0$:\n$h_0 - \\frac{h_0}{2} = \\frac{u^2}{2}$\n$\\frac{h_0}{2} = \\frac{u^2}{2}$\n$h_0 = u^2$\n\nTherefore, the ratio $\\frac{u^2}{h_0} = 1$."
