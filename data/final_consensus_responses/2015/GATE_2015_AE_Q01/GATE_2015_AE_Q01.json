      "reasoning": "The sentence 'Apparent lifelessness ____________ dormant life' requires a verb that conveys the idea of containing, concealing, or having something hidden within. Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. harbours**: To 'harbour' means to keep or conceal (a person or thing), or to be the home or resting place for. In this context, it perfectly implies that beneath the outward appearance of lifelessness, there is hidden or inactive life. For example, a seemingly barren desert might harbour dormant seeds.\n*   **B. leads to**: This implies causation or a consequence. Apparent lifelessness does not necessarily 'lead to' dormant life; rather, it might contain it.\n*   **C. supports**: This implies providing assistance or holding something up. Apparent lifelessness does not 'support' dormant life in the sense of providing aid.\n*   **D. affects**: This implies influence. While apparent lifelessness might 'affect' dormant life, this word does not capture the sense of containment or hidden presence as accurately as 'harbours'.\n\nTherefore, 'harbours' is the most appropriate word to complete the sentence, conveying that dormant life exists within or is concealed by the apparent lifelessness."

        "Define 'dormant life' as life that is inactive, hidden, or in a suspended state, like in seeds or spores.",
        "Identify the implied relationship: the sentence suggests that the 'apparent lifelessness' is a condition that contains or conceals the 'dormant life'. The key idea is containment or hidden presence.",
        "Analyze the meaning of each option: 'harbours' (to contain/conceal), 'leads to' (causes), 'supports' (assists), 'affects' (influences).",
        "Evaluate 'harbours': This word perfectly fits the implied relationship, as it means to keep or conceal, suggesting the lifeless appearance is a cover for hidden life.",
        "Evaluate 'leads to': This is incorrect as apparent lifelessness does not cause dormant life. Evaluate 'supports' and 'affects': These are incorrect as they do not convey the necessary sense of containment or hidden presence.",
        "Conclude that 'harbours' is the most semantically appropriate and grammatically correct choice, completing the sentence to mean that what seems lifeless actually contains hidden life."
