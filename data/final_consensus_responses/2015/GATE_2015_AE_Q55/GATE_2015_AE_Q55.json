      "reasoning": "Both the assertion [a] and the reason [r] are true, and [r] correctly explains [a].\n\nAssertion [a]: Aircraft directional static stability can be improved by moving the vertical tail rearward.\nThis assertion is TRUE. Directional static stability is primarily provided by the vertical tail. The vertical tail generates a side force when the aircraft experiences sideslip, creating a yawing moment that restores the aircraft to zero sideslip. The magnitude of this restoring yawing moment is directly proportional to the moment arm of the vertical tail from the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). Increasing this moment arm enhances the effectiveness of the vertical tail in generating a restoring moment, thus improving directional static stability.\n\nReason [r]: Moving the vertical tail rearward increases the moment arm from the tail aerodynamic center to the aircraft center of gravity.\nThis reason is TRUE. The moment arm ($L_v$ or $l_{vt}$) is defined as the distance between the vertical tail's aerodynamic center (AC) and the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). If the vertical tail is moved further aft (rearward) while the aircraft's CG remains relatively fixed, the distance between the tail's AC and the CG will increase. This is a direct geometric consequence.\n\nRelationship between [a] and [r]:\nReason [r] is the correct explanation for assertion [a]. The increase in the moment arm ($L_v$) due to moving the vertical tail rearward directly leads to an increase in the vertical tail's contribution to the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip ($C_{n_\\beta}$). A larger positive $C_{n_\\beta}$ signifies greater directional static stability. Therefore, increasing the moment arm by moving the tail rearward directly improves directional static stability."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the concept of directional static stability. It refers to an aircraft's tendency to return to its original heading after being disturbed by a sideslip (yaw disturbance). For positive directional static stability, the yawing moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip, $C_{n_\\beta}$, must be positive, meaning a sideslip generates a restoring yawing moment.",
        "Step 1: Identify the primary component responsible for directional static stability. The vertical tail (vertical stabilizer) is the main contributor to directional static stability. When the aircraft experiences a sideslip (β), the vertical tail generates a side force, which creates a restoring yawing moment.",
        "Step 2: Understand the mechanism of the restoring moment. The side force generated by the vertical tail acts at a distance (moment arm) from the aircraft's center of gravity (CG). The magnitude of this yawing moment is directly proportional to this moment arm. The effectiveness of the vertical tail is often quantified by the vertical tail volume ratio, which is directly proportional to the moment arm.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the effect of moving the vertical tail rearward. Moving the vertical tail rearward increases its moment arm ($l_{vt}$ or $L_v$) from the aircraft's CG. This increase in moment arm directly increases the magnitude of the restoring yawing moment generated by the vertical tail for a given side force, thereby improving the aircraft's directional static stability.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Assertion [a]. If the vertical tail is moved rearward, its moment arm from the CG increases. A larger moment arm means that for the same side force, a greater restoring yawing moment will be generated, thus improving directional static stability. So, Assertion [a] is true.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Reason [r]. Moving the vertical tail rearward inherently increases the physical distance between its aerodynamic center and the aircraft's center of gravity, assuming the CG location remains constant. So, Reason [r] is true.",
        "Step 6: Determine if [r] is the correct reason for [a]. Since the improvement in directional stability (Assertion [a]) is directly caused by the increased moment arm (Reason [r]) leading to a larger restoring yawing moment, Reason [r] is indeed the correct explanation for Assertion [a]."

This is critical for meeting certification standards and ensuring safe operation. For example, the vertical stabilizer on a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 is carefully positioned to provide sufficient directional stability.",
        "why_it_matters": "Proper vertical tail design is essential for ensuring an aircraft's directional stability and controllability, which are critical for safe flight operations. Insufficient directional stability can lead to 'Dutch roll' oscillations, making the aircraft difficult to control and potentially dangerous, and can result in poor handling qualities or even loss of control in critical flight conditions."
