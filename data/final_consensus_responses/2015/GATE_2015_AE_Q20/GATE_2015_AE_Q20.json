      "confidence_type": "single_model",
      "reasoning": "The primary purpose of a trailing edge flap is to increase the maximum lift coefficient (C_l,max) of the airfoil. Deploying a trailing edge flap increases the effective camber of the airfoil, which shifts the lift coefficient versus angle of attack (C_l-α) curve upwards. This leads to a higher lift coefficient at any given angle of attack and, crucially, a higher maximum lift coefficient. A higher C_l,max allows the aircraft to generate sufficient lift at lower airspeeds, thereby reducing the stall speed. This is essential for safe takeoff and landing operations, enabling shorter runway requirements and lower approach speeds. While flaps also increase drag, their fundamental design goal is to augment lift. Other options like avoiding flow separation (function of leading-edge devices) or reducing wave/induced drag are not the primary purpose of trailing edge flaps."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Trailing edge flaps are high-lift devices used on aircraft wings, primarily during low-speed phases of flight like takeoff and landing.",
        "Their primary aerodynamic mechanism is to increase the wing's camber (effective curvature) and, in some cases (like Fowler flaps), its effective surface area.",
        "This increase in camber and/or area significantly increases the lift coefficient at a given angle of attack and shifts the entire lift curve upwards.",
        "The most critical outcome of flap deployment is a substantial increase in the maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$) that the airfoil can achieve before stalling.",
        "An increased $C_{L,max}$ allows the aircraft to generate sufficient lift at lower airspeeds, which is crucial for reducing takeoff and landing distances and lowering the stall speed.",
        "Now, let's evaluate the given options:",
        "Option A (avoid flow separation): While some slotted flap designs can help delay flow separation by re-energizing the boundary layer, this is a secondary effect. The primary role of delaying separation at the leading edge belongs to devices like slats.",
        "Option B (increase $C_{L,max}$): This directly corresponds to the primary purpose and fundamental aerodynamic effect of trailing edge flaps, making it the correct answer.",
        "Option C (reduce wave drag): Wave drag is a compressible flow phenomenon relevant at high (transonic/supersonic) speeds. Flaps are deployed at low speeds where wave drag is negligible, and they actually increase overall drag.",
        "Option D (reduce induced drag): Induced drag is a consequence of lift generation. While flaps increase lift, their primary purpose is not to reduce induced drag; in fact, they typically increase total drag, including induced drag at a given speed."
