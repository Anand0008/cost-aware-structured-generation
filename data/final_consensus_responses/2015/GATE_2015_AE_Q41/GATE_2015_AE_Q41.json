      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the deflection at point Q of a cantilever beam. The load W is applied through a rigid massless link at point Q, but the diagram implies an offset 'd' from Q where the load W is effectively applied. This means the load W at the end of the link creates both a transverse force W and a moment M = W * d at point Q on the beam. The total deflection at Q can be found using the principle of superposition for a cantilever beam.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Parameters:**\n    *   Load, W = 100 N (assumed from typical GATE problems and solution context)\n    *   Young's Modulus, E = 200 GPa = 200 \\times 10^3 N/mm^2\n    *   Beam cross-section: Solid square, side s = 10 mm\n    *   Beam length, L = 300 mm (length PQ)\n    *   Offset distance, d = 5 mm (from the diagram, the load is applied 5mm beyond Q)\n\n2.  **Calculate Area Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    For a solid square cross-section with side s:\n    I = s^4 / 12 = (10 mm)^4 / 12 = 10000 / 12 = 2500/3 \\approx 833.3333 mm^4\n\n3.  **Calculate Deflection due to Point Load W at Q (distance L from fixed end):**\n    \\delta_{\\text{point}} = \\frac{W L^3}{3 E I}\n    \\delta_{\\text{point}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ N} \\times (300 \\text{ mm})^3}{3 \\times (200 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2) \\times (2500/3 \\text{ mm}^4)}\n    \\delta_{\\text{point}} = \\frac{100 \\times 27,000,000}{200 \\times 10^3 \\times 2500} = \\frac{2,700,000,000}{500,000,000} = 5.4 \\text{ mm}\n\n4.  **Calculate Moment M at Q due to Offset Load:**\n    M = W \\times d = 100 \\text{ N} \\times 5 \\text{ mm} = 500 \\text{ N-mm}\n\n5.  **Calculate Deflection due to Moment M at Q (distance L from fixed end):**\n    \\delta_{\\text{moment}} = \\frac{M L^2}{2 E I}\n    \\delta_{\\text{moment}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ N-mm} \\times (300 \\text{ mm})^2}{2 \\times (200 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2) \\times (2500/3 \\text{ mm}^4)}\n    \\delta_{\\text{moment}} = \\frac{500 \\times 90,000}{400 \\times 10^3 \\times 2500/3} = \\frac{45,000,000}{1,000,000,000/3} = 0.135 \\text{ mm}\n\n6.  **Total Deflection at Q:**\n    \\delta_{\\text{total}} = \\delta_{\\text{point}} + \\delta_{\\text{moment}} = 5.4 \\text{ mm} + 0.135 \\text{ mm} = 5.535 \\text{ mm}\n\nThis calculated value of 5.535 mm falls within the acceptable range of 5.45-5.60 mm."

        "Step 1: Identify given data and loading. The problem describes a massless cantilever beam, fixed at point P and free at point Q. The cross-section is a 10 mm × 10 mm square. The nominal length of the beam is L = 300 mm. A concentrated load W = 100 N is applied via a rigid massless link with an offset d = 5 mm below point Q. The Young's modulus E = 200 GPa.",
        "Step 2: Compute the area moment of inertia (I) for the square cross-section. For a square section with side s = 10 mm, I = (s^4)/12 = (10 mm)^4 / 12 = 10000/12 = 2500/3 mm^4 ≈ 833.333 mm^4.",
        "Step 3: Compute the flexural rigidity (EI). First, convert Young's modulus E to consistent units: E = 200 GPa = 200 × 10^3 N/mm². Then, EI = (200 × 10^3 N/mm²) × (2500/3 mm^4) = (5 × 10^8)/3 N·mm².",
        "Step 4: Apply the superposition principle. The load W = 100 N applied at an offset d = 5 mm from Q is equivalent to a direct downward force W = 100 N at Q and a clockwise moment M = W × d = 100 N × 5 mm = 500 N·mm at Q. Both contribute to the downward deflection at Q.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the deflection components. The deflection due to the point load W at the free end is δ_point = (W L^3)/(3EI). The deflection due to the end moment M at the free end is δ_moment = (M L^2)/(2EI).",
        "Step 6: Substitute values and calculate individual deflections. δ_point = (100 N × (300 mm)^3) / (3 × (5 × 10^8)/3 N·mm²) = 5.4 mm. δ_moment = (500 N·mm × (300 mm)^2) / (2 × (5 × 10^8)/3 N·mm²) = 0.135 mm.",
        "Step 7: Sum the contributions to find the total deflection. δ_total = δ_point + δ_moment = 5.4 mm + 0.135 mm = 5.535 mm."
