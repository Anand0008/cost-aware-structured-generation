      "reasoning": "Propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$) is maximized when the exhaust velocity ($V_e$ or $V_j$) is close to the flight velocity ($V_{\\infty}$). Turbofan engines, particularly high bypass ratio ones, achieve this by accelerating a larger mass of air (the bypass air) to a lower effective exhaust velocity. This brings the average exhaust velocity closer to the flight velocity, thereby minimizing the kinetic energy wasted in the exhaust and increasing propulsive efficiency. In contrast, turbojet engines (with or without afterburners) and ramjet engines produce very high exhaust velocities by accelerating a smaller mass of air to very high speeds. This results in a larger difference between exhaust and flight velocities, leading to significant kinetic energy losses and consequently lower propulsive efficiency compared to turbofans in their optimal operating regimes."

        "Understand the concept of propulsive efficiency ($\\eta_p$). It measures how effectively the kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust jet is converted into useful thrust power. Recall its definition: $\\eta_p = \\frac{2\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha = V_{\\infty}/V_j$ (flight velocity / jet velocity).",
        "Understand that propulsive efficiency is maximized when $\\alpha$ is close to 1 (i.e., jet velocity is nearly equal to flight velocity), minimizing kinetic energy losses in the exhaust. Now, analyze the different engine types based on this principle.",
        "Compare the jet velocities of different engine types. Turbojets (with or without afterburner) produce high jet velocities, meaning $\\alpha$ is low, leading to lower $\\eta_p$. Afterburning increases jet velocity further, reducing $\\eta_p$ even more. Ramjets also operate with high jet velocities, resulting in lower propulsive efficiency.",
        "Analyze Turbofan engines. Turbofans use a bypass stream to accelerate a larger mass of air at a lower velocity, bringing the effective exhaust velocity closer to the flight velocity. This results in a higher $\\alpha$ and thus significantly higher propulsive efficiency, especially for subsonic flight.",
        "Based on this analysis, turbofan engines, particularly high bypass ratio ones, are designed for higher propulsive efficiency by minimizing exhaust kinetic energy losses, making them the most efficient among the given options.",
        "Therefore, among the given options, the Turbofan engine has the highest propulsive efficiency."
