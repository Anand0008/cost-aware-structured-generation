This represents half the difference between the major and minor principal stresses and is equivalent to the radius of Mohr's circle for the in-plane stress state.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula: $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{max}} = \\\\frac{25 \\\\text{ MPa} - (-25 \\\\text{ MPa})}{2} = \\\\frac{50 \\\\text{ MPa}}{2} = 25 \\\\text{ MPa}$.",
        "Step 4: (Optional verification) To find the absolute maximum shear stress for a 3D state, consider the three possible shear stresses from Mohr's circles: $\\\\frac{|\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2|}{2}$, $\\\\frac{|\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3|}{2}$, and $\\\\frac{|\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1|}{2}$. Given $\\\\sigma_1 = 25$ MPa, $\\\\sigma_2 = -25$ MPa, and $\\\\sigma_3 = 0$ MPa (plane stress):\\\\n\\\\n$\\\\frac{|25 - (-25)|}{2} = \\\\frac{50}{2} = 25$ MPa\\\\n$\\\\frac{|-25 - 0|}{2} = \\\\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$ MPa\\\\n$\\\\frac{|0 - 25|}{2} = \\\\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$ MPa\\\\n\\\\nThe absolute maximum shear stress is the largest of these values, which is 25 MPa.
