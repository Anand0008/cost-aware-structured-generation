      "reasoning": "The given Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) = 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the PDE.**\nFirst, we need to simplify the second term using the chain rule for partial derivatives. Let $f(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$. Then $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (f(u)) = f'(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\nHere, $f'(u) = \\frac{d}{du} \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2u) = u$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) = u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\nSubstituting this back into the original PDE, we get the simplified form:\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Order of the PDE.**\nThe order of a PDE is determined by the highest order of any partial derivative present in the equation. In the simplified PDE, the derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$. Both are first-order partial derivatives. Therefore, the PDE is a **first-order** PDE.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Linearity of the PDE.**\nA PDE is classified as linear if the dependent variable ($u$) and all its partial derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together. If any term contains products of the dependent variable with its derivatives, or products of derivatives, or non-linear functions of the dependent variable (e.g., $u^2$, $\\sin(u)$, $e^u$), then the PDE is non-linear.\nIn the simplified PDE, the term $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ contains the dependent variable $u$ multiplied by its first partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$. This product makes the equation **non-linear**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the PDE is **non-linear and first order**, which corresponds to option C."
