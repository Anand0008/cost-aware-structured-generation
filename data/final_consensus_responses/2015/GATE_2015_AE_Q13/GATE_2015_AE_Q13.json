      "reasoning": "The question describes a linear mass-spring-dashpot system in free vibration that is 'over-damped'. An over-damped system undergoes non-oscillatory motion because the damping force is sufficiently large to prevent oscillation, causing the system to decay exponentially to the equilibrium position.\n\nTo elaborate, the equation of motion for a linear mass-spring-dashpot system in free vibration is:\n$m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = 0$\nwhere $m$ is mass, $c$ is damping coefficient, $k$ is spring stiffness, $x$ is displacement, $\\dot{x}$ is velocity, and $\\ddot{x}$ is acceleration.\n\nThe damping ratio $\\zeta$ is a critical parameter, defined as $\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2 \\sqrt{mk}}$.\nFor an over-damped system, the damping ratio $\\zeta > 1$.\nIn this condition, the roots of the characteristic equation ($m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0$) are real, distinct, and negative. The general solution for the displacement $x(t)$ will consist of two exponentially decaying terms, without any oscillatory (sinusoidal) components. This means the system returns to its equilibrium position exponentially without oscillating or crossing the equilibrium position more than once.\n\nTherefore, an over-damped system undergoes non-oscillatory motion. Option A is correct."
