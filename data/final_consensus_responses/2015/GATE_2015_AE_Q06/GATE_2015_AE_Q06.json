      "confidence_type": "single_model",
      "reasoning": "The original sentence is: \"Increased productivity necessary reflects greater efforts made by the employees.\" The word 'necessary' is an adjective. In this sentence, 'necessary' is intended to modify the verb 'reflects'. However, adjectives modify nouns or pronouns, while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Therefore, an adverbial form is required to correctly modify the verb 'reflects'. The adverbial form of 'necessary' is 'necessarily'.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. \"Increase in productivity necessary\": This option still uses 'necessary' as an adjective, and the phrasing is grammatically awkward and incorrect in this context.\nB. \"Increase productivity is necessary\": This option significantly alters the meaning of the original sentence. It changes the subject and the main assertion.\nC. \"Increase in productivity necessarily\": This option correctly replaces the adjective 'necessary' with the adverb 'necessarily'. The sentence becomes: \"Increase in productivity necessarily reflects greater efforts made by the employees.\" Here, 'necessarily' correctly modifies the verb 'reflects', indicating the manner or certainty of reflection. This option maintains the original meaning while correcting the grammatical error.\nD. \"No improvement required\": This is incorrect because the original sentence contains a grammatical error (adjective used in place of an adverb)."

        "Recall the grammatical rule that adjectives modify nouns and pronouns, while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.",
        "Determine that since 'reflects' is a verb, it must be modified by an adverb, not an adjective like 'necessary'.",
        "Identify the correct adverbial form of 'necessary', which is 'necessarily'.",
        "Substitute 'necessary' with 'necessarily' to form the grammatically correct phrase: \"Increased productivity necessarily reflects...\"",
        "Evaluate the given options and select the one that correctly uses the adverb 'necessarily' to modify 'reflects', making the sentence grammatically correct and preserving its original meaning."
