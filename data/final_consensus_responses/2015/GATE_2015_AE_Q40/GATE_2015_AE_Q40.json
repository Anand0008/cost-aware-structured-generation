      "reasoning": "The problem involves a linear elastic isotropic material subjected to uniform hydrostatic pressure. The key is to use the relationship between Young's Modulus (E), Bulk Modulus (K), and Poisson's Ratio (ν).\n\nFirst, identify the given values:\n- Hydrostatic pressure, p = 100 N/mm^2\n- Volumetric shrinkage = 0.05%, so volumetric strain ε_v = -0.0005 (negative for shrinkage)\n- Young's modulus, E = 300 GPa = 300,000 N/mm^2\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Bulk Modulus (K).\nThe Bulk Modulus is defined as the ratio of hydrostatic pressure to volumetric strain. For compressive pressure, the formula is K = -p / ε_v.\nK = -100 N/mm^2 / (-0.0005) = 200,000 N/mm^2\nConvert K to GPa for consistency with E: K = 200 GPa.\n\nStep 2: Use the relationship between E, K, and ν.\nThe relationship for an isotropic material is E = 3K(1 - 2ν).\nSubstitute the known values of E and K:\n300 GPa = 3 × (200 GPa) × (1 - 2ν)\n300 = 600 × (1 - 2ν)\n\nStep 3: Solve for Poisson's ratio (ν).\nDivide both sides by 600:\n0.5 = 1 - 2ν\nRearrange the equation:\n2ν = 1 - 0.5\n2ν = 0.5\nν = 0.5 / 2\nν = 0.25\n\nThe calculated Poisson's ratio of 0.25 is within the typical physical range for engineering materials (0 ≤ ν ≤ 0.5), confirming the correctness of the answer. Careful unit handling (GPa, N/mm^2, percentage) is crucial for accurate calculation."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given data and ensure consistent units. Hydrostatic pressure $p = 100 \\text{ N/mm}^2 = 100 \\text{ MPa}$. Volumetric shrinkage is 0.05%, which means the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_v = -0.0005$ (negative for shrinkage). Young's modulus $E = 300 \\text{ GPa} = 300 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2 = 300,000 \\text{ MPa}$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the constitutive relationship for volumetric strain under hydrostatic stress for an isotropic linear elastic material. The volumetric strain $\\epsilon_v$ is related to hydrostatic pressure $p$, Young's modulus $E$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ by the formula: $\\epsilon_v = \\frac{-3p(1 - 2\\nu)}{E}$.",
        "Step 3: Rearrange the formula to solve for Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. From $\\epsilon_v = \\frac{-3p(1 - 2\\nu)}{E}$, we get $1 - 2\\nu = \\frac{\\epsilon_v E}{-3p}$. This simplifies to $2\\nu = 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_v E}{-3p} = 1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_v E}{3p}$. Therefore, $\\nu = 0.5 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_v E}{3p}\\right)$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the known values into the rearranged formula to calculate $\\nu$. First, calculate the term $\\frac{\\epsilon_v E}{3p}$: $\\frac{(-0.0005) \\times (300,000 \\text{ MPa})}{3 \\times 100 \\text{ MPa}} = \\frac{-150}{300} = -0.5$. Now, substitute this into the equation for $\\nu$: $\\nu = 0.5 \\times (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.",
        "Step 5: (Verification using Bulk Modulus) Calculate the Bulk Modulus $K$ using its definition: $K = -p / \\epsilon_v = -100 \\text{ MPa} / (-0.0005) = 200,000 \\text{ MPa} = 200 \\text{ GPa}$. Then, use the relationship between Young's Modulus $E$, Bulk Modulus $K$, and Poisson's Ratio $\\nu$: $K = \\frac{E}{3(1 - 2\\nu)}$. Rearranging for $(1 - 2\\nu)$: $1 - 2\\nu = \\frac{E}{3K} = \\frac{300,000 \\text{ MPa}}{3 \\times 200,000 \\text{ MPa}} = \\frac{300,000}{600,000} = 0.5$. Solving for $\\nu$: $2\\nu = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\implies \\nu = 0.25$. Both methods yield the same result.",
        "Step 6: Confirm that the calculated Poisson's ratio (0.25) is within the physically acceptable range for most engineering materials, which is $0 \\le \\nu \\le 0.5$. This confirms the reasonableness of the result.",
