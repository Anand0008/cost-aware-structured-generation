The wind speed \\(\\vec{v}_w^b\\) is the velocity of the air mass relative to the inertial frame, also expressed in body axes. The aircraft's velocity relative to the air (airspeed vector, \\(\\vec{v}_a^b\\)) is what determines aerodynamic angles. Given: \\(\\vec{v}_g^b = (100, 5, 5)\\) m/s and \\(\\vec{v}_w^b = (0, -5, -10)\\) m/s.",
