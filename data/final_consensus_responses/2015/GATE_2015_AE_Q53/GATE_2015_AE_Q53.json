For the given function $f(x) = 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, applying Simpson's 1/3 rule with $a=1$, $b=2$, and $h=(b-a)/2 = 0.5$ yields 26. This result is exact because Simpson's 1/3 rule perfectly integrates polynomials up to cubic degree, and the given integrand is a cubic polynomial. The fourth derivative of the function is zero, which makes the error term for Simpson's rule zero, thus the numerical approximation is precisely the analytical value."
