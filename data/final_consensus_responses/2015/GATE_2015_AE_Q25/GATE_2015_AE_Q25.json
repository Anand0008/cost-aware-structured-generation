      "reasoning": "The static displacement of a mass suspended by a spring is determined by the balance between the gravitational force acting on the mass and the upward spring force. This is given by the static equilibrium equation: $m \\cdot g = k \\cdot \\delta_{static}$. Given mass $m = 0.5 \\text{ kg}$ and stiffness $k = 5 \\text{ N/mm}$, we first convert the stiffness to consistent units: $k = 5 \\text{ N/mm} = 5 \\times 1000 \\text{ N/m} = 5000 \\text{ N/m}$. Using $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$, the static displacement is $\\delta_{static} = \\frac{m \\cdot g}{k} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ kg} \\cdot 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}{5000 \\text{ N/m}} = \\frac{4.905 \\text{ N}}{5000 \\text{ N/m}} = 0.000981 \\text{ m}$. Converting this to millimeters, $\\delta_{static} = 0.000981 \\text{ m} \\times 1000 \\text{ mm/m} = 0.981 \\text{ mm}$. Rounding to two decimal places, the static displacement is $0.98 \\text{ mm}$.
