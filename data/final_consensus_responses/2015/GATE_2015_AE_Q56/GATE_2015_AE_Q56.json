For a 2-D source at the origin, the radial velocity is v_r = m/(2\\pi r). Along the negative x-axis (upstream), the x-velocity component due to the source opposes the uniform flow. Thus, the total x-velocity is u = U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi r), where r is the distance from the source.\n\nThe stagnation point occurs where u = 0. Let s be the distance of the stagnation point from the source. So, at r = s, u = 0, which gives U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi s) = 0. This implies m/(2\\pi) = U_\\infty s.\n\nPoint P is located upstream of the stagnation point at a distance d from it. Since the source is at x=0 and the stagnation point is at x=-s, point P is at x = -(s+d) relative to the source. Therefore, the distance from the source to P is r_P = s + d.\n\nThe x-velocity at point P is u_P = U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi r_P) = U_\\infty - m/(2\\pi (s + d)).\nSubstitute m/(2\\pi) = U_\\infty s into the equation for u_P:\nu_P = U_\\infty - \\frac{U_\\infty s}{s + d} = U_\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{s + d}\\right) = U_\\infty \\frac{s + d - s}{s + d} = U_\\infty \\frac{d}{s + d}.\n\nThe problem states that at P, the oncoming stream reaches 90% of its undisturbed velocity, so u_P = 0.9 U_\\infty.\nEquating the two expressions for u_P: 0.9 U_\\infty = U_\\infty \\frac{d}{s + d}.\nDividing by U_\\infty (assuming U_\\infty \\neq 0): 0.9 = \\frac{d}{s + d}.\nNow, solve for d/s: 0.9(s + d) = d \\Rightarrow 0.9s + 0.9d = d \\Rightarrow 0.9s = d - 0.9d \\Rightarrow 0.9s = 0.1d.\nFinally, d/s = 0.9 / 0.1 = 9.0."

For a source at the origin and uniform flow $U_{\\infty}$ in the positive x-direction, the velocity is $u = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi} \\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$. On the x-axis ($y=0$), this simplifies to $u = U_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi x}$ for $x \\neq 0$. For points upstream of the source ($x<0$), $r = |x|$, so $u = U_{\\infty} - \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi |x|}$.",

        "Relate the stagnation point location to 's'. The problem defines 's' as the distance of the line source (at $x=0$) from the front stagnation point ($x_{stag}$). Thus, $s = |x_{stag}| = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U_{\\infty}}$. This implies $\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi} = U_{\\infty}s$.",
