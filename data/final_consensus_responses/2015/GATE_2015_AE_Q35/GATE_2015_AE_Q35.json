      "reasoning": "A rocket nozzle designed for maximum thrust at a specific altitude (H = 8 km) is optimally expanded at that point, meaning its exit pressure ($P_e$) equals the ambient atmospheric pressure ($P_a$). As the rocket ascends to altitudes `H > 8 km`, the ambient atmospheric pressure ($P_a$) decreases. Since the nozzle's exit pressure ($P_e$) is primarily determined by its fixed geometry and chamber conditions, it remains relatively constant. Therefore, for `H > 8 km`, the fixed $P_e$ will be greater than the now lower ambient pressure ($P_a$). This condition, $P_e > P_a$, defines an **under-expanded nozzle**. In this state, the exhaust gases exit at a pressure higher than the surrounding atmosphere and continue to expand outside the nozzle. Conversely, for `H < 8 km`, the ambient pressure ($P_a$) would be higher than at 8 km, leading to $P_e < P_a$, which is an over-expanded condition. Options related to sonic exit or unchoked conditions are incorrect for a properly functioning rocket nozzle, which typically operates with supersonic flow at the exit and is choked at the throat."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the design condition. A nozzle designed for maximum thrust at a specific altitude (H = 8 km) is optimally expanded at that altitude. This means the nozzle exit pressure (P_e) exactly matches the ambient atmospheric pressure (P_a) at that altitude: P_{e,design} = P_{a,design}.",
        "Step 2: Recall how ambient pressure varies with altitude. Atmospheric pressure decreases monotonically with increasing altitude. Therefore, at altitudes above the design point (H > 8 km), P_a is lower than P_{a,design}. At altitudes below the design point (H < 8 km), P_a is higher than P_{a,design}.",
        "Step 3: Analyze off-design operation for H > 8 km. For a fixed-geometry rocket nozzle operating with constant chamber conditions, the exit pressure (P_e) is approximately fixed (determined by the nozzle's expansion ratio) and does not change significantly with external ambient pressure. At altitudes greater than 8 km, the ambient pressure (P_a) will be lower than the ambient pressure at 8 km (the design altitude).",
        "Step 4: Compare P_e and P_a for H > 8 km. Since P_e is fixed (designed to match P_a at 8 km), and P_a is lower at H > 8 km, the relationship becomes P_e > P_a. This condition, where the nozzle exit pressure is greater than the ambient pressure, defines an under-expanded nozzle.",
        "Step 5: Conclude that for altitudes H > 8 km, the nozzle operates in an under-expanded condition. This matches option A.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate other options. For H < 8 km, P_a would be higher than at 8 km, leading to P_e < P_a, which is an over-expanded condition (making option B incorrect). Option C (sonic exit) is incorrect because a properly designed rocket nozzle has supersonic flow at the exit. Option D (unchoked condition) is incorrect as the throat remains choked (sonic) for a wide range of back pressures in a C-D nozzle."

        "description": "Plot or visualize qualitatively how thrust changes with altitude for a nozzle designed at a specific altitude. At design altitude, pressure thrust term is zero ($p_e = p_a$). Above this altitude, $p_a$ decreases, making $(p_e - p_a)A_e$ positive and indicating under-expansion.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Builds strong physical intuition about thrust variation with altitude. Cons: Slower than direct inequality-based reasoning and not necessary for quick MCQ answers.",

As altitude increases, $P_a$ decreases, making the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a)A_e$ more positive. When $P_e > P_a$, this term adds to thrust, but $V_e$ is not maximized because expansion could have continued. This is the under-expanded condition.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Connects directly to thrust performance. Cons: Slightly more involved than simple pressure comparison.",

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Can maintain near-optimal performance over a wider altitude range. Cons: More complex design, additional weight and moving parts.",
