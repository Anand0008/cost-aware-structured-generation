In the context of GATE problems where local freestream density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$) is provided along with total ($p_0$) and static ($p_{\\infty}$) pressures, 'indicated airspeed' is typically interpreted as the velocity calculated using the incompressible Bernoulli equation with the *given local freestream density*, even if the flow is compressible. The presence of $\\gamma$ is a distractor for this specific calculation.\nUsing the incompressible Bernoulli equation for a Pitot-static tube:\n1. Calculate the dynamic pressure: $q = p_0 - p_{\\infty} = 54051 - 45565 = 8486 \\text{ N/m}^2$.\n2. Apply the incompressible velocity formula: $V_{indicated} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q}{\\rho_{\\infty}}}$.\nSubstituting the given values: $V_{indicated} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 8486}{0.6417}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16972}{0.6417}} = \\sqrt{26449.90} \\approx 162.63 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThis value matches option B (162.6 m/s)."
