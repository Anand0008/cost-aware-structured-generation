The moment about the trailing edge is found by transferring the moment from the aerodynamic center: $c_{m,TE} = (3/4) c_l$. With $\\alpha = 2^\\circ = \\pi/90$ rad, $c_l \\approx 0.2193$, yielding $c_{m,TE} \\approx 0.1645$, which falls within the provided answer range."

        "Step 3: Calculate the sectional lift coefficient ($c_l$) using the thin airfoil theory result for symmetric airfoils: $c_l = 2\\pi\\alpha$. Substitute the radian value: $c_l = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\pi}{90} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{90} \\approx 0.2193$.",
        "Step 4: Determine the pitching moment coefficient about the trailing edge ($c_{m,TE}$). For a thin symmetric airfoil, the aerodynamic center is at the quarter-chord ($x = c/4$) where the pitching moment is zero ($c_{m,ac} = 0$). Use the moment transfer formula $c_{m,x_2} = c_{m,x_1} + c_l \\left( \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{c} \\right)$ with $x_1 = c/4$ and $x_2 = c$. This simplifies to $c_{m,TE} = c_{m,ac} + c_l \\left( \\frac{c - c/4}{c} \\right) = 0 + c_l \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = \\frac{3}{4}c_l$. Calculate $c_{m,TE} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 0.2193 \\approx 0.1645$.",

The moment about the trailing edge due to lift acting at the quarter-chord is: $M'_{TE} = L' \\times (c - c/4) = \\frac{3c}{4} L'$ (positive, nose-up). Non-dimensionalizing: $c_{m,TE} = \\frac{M'_{TE}}{q_\\infty c^2} = \\frac{(3c/4) L'}{q_\\infty c^2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{L'}{q_\\infty c} = \\frac{3}{4} c_l$.",
