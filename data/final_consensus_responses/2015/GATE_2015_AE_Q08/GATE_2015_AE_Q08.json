Area of triangle QTS = 20 cm².\n3. `PS:QS = 3:1`.\n4. `RT:QT = 5:2`.\n5. `PU:UR = 1:1` (This information is not required for solving the area of PQR, it's a distractor).\n\nLet `QS = x` and `QT = y`.\n\nFrom the area of triangle QTS:\n`Area(QTS) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * QS * QT`\n`20 = (1/2) * x * y`\n`x * y = 40` (Equation 1)\n\nNow, consider triangle PQR:\nIts base is `PQ` and its height is `RQ` (since angle Q is a right angle).\n\nFrom the ratio `PS:QS = 3:1`:\n`PS = 3 * QS = 3x`\n`PQ = PS + QS = 3x + x = 4x`\n\nFrom the ratio `RT:QT = 5:2`:\n`RT = (5/2) * QT = (5/2)y`\n`RQ = RT + TQ = (5/2)y + y = (7/2)y`\n\nNow, calculate the area of triangle PQR:\n`Area(PQR) = (1/2) * PQ * RQ`\n`Area(PQR) = (1/2) * (4x) * ((7/2)y)`\n`Area(PQR) = (1/2) * 4 * (7/2) * x * y`\n`Area(PQR) = 2 * (7/2) * x * y`\n`Area(PQR) = 7 * x * y`\n\nSubstitute `x * y = 40` from Equation 1:\n`Area(PQR) = 7 * 40`\n`Area(PQR) = 280 cm²`\n\nThe calculated area matches the given correct answer."

        "description": "Use the fact that area of triangle = (1/2)*product of two sides * sine of included angle. For triangle QTS, area = (1/2)*QS*QT*sin(angle TQS). If angle TQS = angle PQR = 90°, then sin=1. So area(QTS)= (1/2)*QS*QT. Similarly, area(PQR)= (1/2)*PQ*QR. Express PQ and QR in terms of QS and QT using given ratios (e.g., PQ = 4 QS, QR = (7/2) QT). Then area(PQR)= (1/2)*4QS*(7/2)QT = 14 * (1/2 QS QT) = 14 * area(QTS).",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Faster and more elegant for problems with proportional sides and shared angles. Cons: Requires careful handling of ratios and identification of similar geometric properties.",
        "when_to_use": "When the triangles share the same angle and the sides are proportional, or when a quick proportional solution is desired."

      {
        "description": "Assign coordinates to the vertices P, Q, R, S, T, U. For example, let Q be at (0,0). If angle Q is a right angle, P could be at (x_P, 0) and R at (0, y_R). Then, use the distance formula for segment lengths and the determinant formula for the area of a triangle (e.g., Area = 1/2 |x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2)|).",
        "name": "Coordinate Geometry Approach",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Can be systematic and less prone to conceptual errors for complex figures. Cons: More computationally intensive and time-consuming for simpler geometric problems. Requires careful coordinate assignment and algebraic manipulation.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for problems with more complex vertex arrangements, or when angles other than right angles are involved, making base/height identification difficult."
