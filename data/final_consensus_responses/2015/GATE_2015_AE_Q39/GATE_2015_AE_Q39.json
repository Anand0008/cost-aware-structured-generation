A 'surface normal to the x-axis' refers to the x-face of an infinitesimal element. On this x-face, the normal stress component is \\sigma_x, and the tangential (or shear) stress component is \\tau_{xy}. The question specifically asks for the 'magnitude of the tangential stress' on this surface. Therefore, the value is \\tau_{xy} = 50 \\text{ MPa}."
