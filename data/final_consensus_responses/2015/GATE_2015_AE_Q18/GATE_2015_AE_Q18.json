Non-oscillatory modes have real roots (e.g., $s = \\sigma$), indicating a direct exponential decay or divergence without oscillation.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   **A. Short Period Mode:** This is a longitudinal oscillatory mode, characterized by rapid damping and a relatively high frequency. Its roots are complex conjugate.\n*   **B. Phugoid Mode:** This is a longitudinal oscillatory mode, characterized by light damping and a very low frequency. Its roots are complex conjugate.\n*   **C. Dutch Roll Mode:** This is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode, characterized by coupled yawing, rolling, and sideslipping motions. Its roots are complex conjugate.\n*   **D. Spiral Mode:** This is a lateral-directional non-oscillatory mode. It describes a slow, gradual divergence (if unstable) or convergence (if stable) in bank angle and heading without any oscillatory behavior. Its root is real, often very close to zero.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only the Spiral mode exhibits non-oscillatory response characteristics."
