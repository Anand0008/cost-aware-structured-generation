The relevant formula for equilibrium glide velocity is:\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S) \\cos{\\theta}}{\\rho_\\infty C_L}}$$\nFor an aircraft gliding at $(L/D)_{max}$, the glide angle $\\theta$ is typically small. Therefore, the common approximation $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$ is valid. (Alternatively, $\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{L/D} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$, which gives $\\theta \\approx 5.71^{\\circ}$, and $\\cos(5.71^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.995$, very close to 1).\n\nSubstitute the given values into the glide velocity formula:\n- Wing loading ($W/S$) = $500 \\text{ N/m}^2$\n- Air density ($\\rho_\\infty$) = $0.9 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n- Lift coefficient ($C_L$) = $0.69$\n- $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$\n\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 500 \\times 1}{0.9 \\times 0.69}}$$\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{1000}{0.621}}$$\n$$V_\\infty = \\sqrt{1610.305958}$$\n$$V_\\infty \\approx 40.1286 \\text{ m/s}$$\nRounding to two decimal places, $V_\\infty \\approx 40.13 \\text{ m/s}$.

Also, identify the given parameters: wing loading (W/S), maximum lift-to-drag ratio ((L/D)_{max}), lift coefficient (C_L), and free stream density (\\rho_\\infty).",
        "Step 2: Combine the equations to derive the equilibrium glide velocity formula: \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty}^2 S C_L = W\\cos\\theta \\implies V_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S)\\cos\\theta}{\\rho_{\\infty} C_L}}.",
