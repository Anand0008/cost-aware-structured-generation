The density variation with altitude is derived from the hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law.\n\n1.  **Hydrostatic equilibrium**: $\\frac{dp}{dh} = -\\rho g_0$\n2.  **Ideal gas law**: $p = \\rho R T \\Rightarrow \\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$\n\nSubstitute the ideal gas law into the hydrostatic equation:\n$\\frac{dp}{dh} = -\\frac{p}{R T} g_0$\n\nRearrange and integrate from the base of the layer $(p_1, h_1)$ to an arbitrary altitude $(p, h)$:\n$\\int_{p_1}^{p} \\frac{1}{p} \\, dp = -\\frac{g_0}{R T} \\int_{h_1}^{h} dh$\n\nThis integration yields:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_1}\\right) = -\\frac{g_0}{R T}(h - h_1)$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$\\frac{p}{p_1} = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{g_0}{R T}(h - h_1)\\right]$\n\nSince the temperature T is constant in an isothermal layer, the ratio $p/\\rho = RT$ is also constant. Therefore, $p/p_1 = \\rho/\\rho_1$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n$\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_1} = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{g_0}{R T}(h - h_1)\\right]$\n\nThis formula shows that density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude, which is physically correct. This expression directly matches Option A. Options B, C, and D contain incorrect signs or inverted terms, leading to unphysical results or incorrect decay rates."
