The general formula for momentum thrust is $F = \\dot{m}_e V_e - \\dot{m}_a V_a$, where $\\dot{m}_e$ is the exhaust mass flow rate, $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity, $\\dot{m}_a$ is the inlet air mass flow rate, and $V_a$ is the inlet (flight) velocity.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Parameters:**\n    *   Inlet air mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_a = 94$ kg/s\n    *   Inlet velocity, $V_a = 180$ m/s\n    *   Exit velocity, $V_e = 640$ m/s\n    *   Air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) = 9.2 kg air / 1 kg fuel. This means $\\frac{\\dot{m}_a}{\\dot{m}_f} = 9.2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Fuel Mass Flow Rate ($\\dot{m}_f$):**\n    From the AFR, $\\dot{m}_f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_a}{9.2} = \\frac{94 \\text{ kg/s}}{9.2} \\approx 10.2174 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Exhaust Mass Flow Rate ($\\dot{m}_e$):**\n    The exhaust mass flow rate is the sum of air and fuel mass flow rates: $\\dot{m}_e = \\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f = 94 \\text{ kg/s} + 10.2174 \\text{ kg/s} = 104.2174 \\text{ kg/s}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Momentum Thrust (F):**\n    Using the momentum thrust formula:\n    $F = (104.2174 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (640 \\text{ m/s}) - (94 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (180 \\text{ m/s})$\n    $F = 66699.136 \\text{ N} - 16920 \\text{ N}$\n    $F = 49779.136 \\text{ N}$\n\n5.  **Round to Nearest Integer:**\n    Rounding $49779.136$ N to the nearest integer gives $49779$ N, which corresponds to Option D."
