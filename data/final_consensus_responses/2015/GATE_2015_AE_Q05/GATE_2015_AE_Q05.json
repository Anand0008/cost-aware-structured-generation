      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the number of unique pairs that can be formed from a set of 5 teams, where the order of teams in a pair does not matter (Team A playing Team B is the same match as Team B playing Team A). This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using the combination formula. For N items, choosing k at a time, the number of combinations is given by $C(N, k) = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}$. In this case, N = 5 teams and k = 2 teams per match. Therefore, the number of matches is $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$. Alternatively, the formula n(n-1)/2 can be used: 5(5-1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. The calculated value is 10."
