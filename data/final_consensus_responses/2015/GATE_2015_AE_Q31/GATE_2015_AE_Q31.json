      "reasoning": "The lift-curve slope for a finite wing of elliptic planform is given by the formula $a = \\frac{a_0}{1 + a_0 / (\\pi AR)}$, where $a_0$ is the 2D airfoil lift-curve slope and $AR$ is the aspect ratio. As the aspect ratio $AR \\rightarrow \\infty$, the term $a_0 / (\\pi AR)$ approaches 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to $a = a_0$. For a thin airfoil, the 2D lift-curve slope $a_0$ is $2\\pi$ per radian. Substituting $a_0 = 2\\pi$, we get $a = 2\\pi \\approx 6.28318$. The correct answer range of 6.27 to 6.29 is consistent with this calculated value."
