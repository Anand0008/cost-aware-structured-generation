      "reasoning": "A biplane configuration consists of two wings, which effectively provides a larger total lifting area compared to a monoplane with identical airfoil sections, wingspans, and incidence angles. This larger lifting area, at the same incidence angle, leads to a higher total lift generated by the biplane.\n\nHowever, the close proximity of the two wings in a biplane causes significant aerodynamic interference. The downwash from one wing affects the other, which can reduce the effective angle of attack for each individual wing. Despite this, the increase in total lifting surface area typically results in a net increase in overall lift compared to a single monoplane wing.\n\nRegarding drag, the biplane experiences higher drag for several reasons:\n1.  **Profile/Parasitic Drag:** Biplanes have a larger total wetted area (two wings) and often require additional structural components like struts and bracing wires. These components significantly increase the parasitic drag (zero-lift drag) compared to a cleaner monoplane design.\n2.  **Induced Drag:** Induced drag is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient and inversely proportional to the aspect ratio and Oswald efficiency factor. Since the biplane generates higher total lift, its overall lift coefficient (based on total reference area) will be higher. More importantly, the mutual interference between the wings in a biplane configuration effectively reduces the aerodynamic efficiency (lower effective aspect ratio or Oswald efficiency factor) compared to an optimally designed monoplane for the same total span and lift. This interference leads to a higher induced drag.\n\nCombining these effects, the biplane experiences both higher total lift and higher total drag compared to the monoplane under the given identical conditions. This matches option A."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the configuration difference. A monoplane has one wing, while a biplane has two wings. The question specifies identical airfoil sections, wingspans, and incidence angles. This means the biplane has approximately double the lifting area compared to the monoplane.",
        "Step 2: Analyze Lift Generation. Given identical airfoil sections and incidence angles, and with approximately double the wing area, the biplane generates significantly higher total lift than the monoplane. This is true even when accounting for aerodynamic interference between the two wings, which can reduce the effective angle of attack for each wing.",
        "Step 3: Analyze Drag Components. Total drag consists of profile drag (skin friction and pressure drag) and induced drag (drag due to lift). For the biplane, having two wings means significantly more wetted surface area and additional structural elements (struts, wires), which directly increases the profile (parasitic) drag.",
        "Step 4: Analyze Induced Drag. Induced drag is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient (C_L^2) and inversely proportional to the effective aspect ratio and Oswald efficiency factor. Since the biplane generates higher total lift (from Step 2), its overall C_L will be higher. Furthermore, the close proximity of the two wings in a biplane configuration leads to significant aerodynamic interference, reducing the overall aerodynamic efficiency (effectively lowering the Oswald efficiency factor or effective aspect ratio). Both these factors contribute to a significantly higher induced drag for the biplane.",
        "Step 5: Conclude. Combining the higher total lift (due to greater wing area), higher profile drag (due to increased wetted area and structural components), and significantly higher induced drag (due to higher total lift and wing-wing interference), the biplane experiences both a higher total lift and a higher total drag compared to the monoplane.",
