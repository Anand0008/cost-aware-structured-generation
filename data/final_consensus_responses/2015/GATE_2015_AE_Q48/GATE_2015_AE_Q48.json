The average time-of-flight for a particle to move from the leading edge to the trailing edge on the suction and pressure sides are t1 and t2, respectively. Thin aerofoil theory yields the velocity perturbation to the freestream as V_inf (1 + cos theta) alpha / sin theta on the suction side and as -V_inf (1 + cos theta) alpha / sin theta on the pressure side, where theta corresponds to the chordwise position, x = c/2 (1 - cos theta).

      "reasoning": "Time of flight along each surface is the line integral of ds/V over the chord. Using thin airfoil theory, the local tangential velocity on the suction side is $V_\\infty + V_\\infty (1+\\cos\\theta)\\alpha/\\sin\\theta$ and on the pressure side is $V_\\infty - V_\\infty (1+\\cos\\theta)\\alpha/\\sin\\theta$. With $x = (c/2)(1-\\cos\\theta)$, we have $dx = (c/2)\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta$ and, for a thin symmetric airfoil, $ds \\approx dx$. Thus\n\n$t_1 = \\int_0^c \\frac{dx}{V_1(x)}$, $t_2 = \\int_0^c \\frac{dx}{V_2(x)}$.\n\nChanging variable to $\\theta$ (0 to $\\pi$):\n\n$t_1 = \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{(c/2)\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta}{V_\\infty\\left[1 + \\alpha\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\right]}$, \\quad $t_2 = \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{(c/2)\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta}{V_\\infty\\left[1 - \\alpha\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\right]}$.\n\nDefine $A = \\alpha\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$. Then\n\n$t_2 - t_1 = \\frac{c}{2V_\\infty}\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta\\left[\\frac{1}{1-A} - \\frac{1}{1+A}\\right]d\\theta = \\frac{c}{2V_\\infty}\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta\\,\\frac{2A}{1-A^2}\\,d\\theta$.\n\nSubstitute back $A$ and simplify:\n\n$t_2 - t_1 = \\frac{c}{V_\\infty}\\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\alpha(1+\\cos\\theta)}{1 - \\alpha^2\\left(\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\right)^2}\\,d\\theta$.\n\nUsing $1+\\cos\\theta = 2\\cos^2(\\theta/2)$, $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, this reduces to an elementary integral in $u = \\theta/2$ that evaluates to\n\n$t_2 - t_1 = \\frac{8\\pi\\alpha c}{V_\\infty(4 - \\pi^2\\alpha^2)}$.\n\nThis matches option D. The sign is positive, meaning the pressure-side particle (lower speed) takes longer, so $t_2 > t_1$, consistent with physics."
