      "reasoning": "The problem involves calculating the maximum torque a thin-walled closed rectangular tube can withstand, given its dimensions, shear modulus, and maximum allowable angle of twist. This is solved using Bredt-Batho theory for torsion of thin-walled sections. The critical step is to correctly interpret the wall thicknesses from the provided diagram, which shows different thicknesses for horizontal (3 mm) and vertical (5 mm) walls, despite a general 't = 3 mm' mentioned in the text description. Using the explicit thicknesses from the diagram, the mid-thickness dimensions are calculated as $b_m = 35 \\text{ mm}$ and $h_m = 57 \\text{ mm}$. The enclosed mid-thickness area $A_m = b_m \\times h_m = 0.035 \\text{ m} \\times 0.057 \\text{ m} = 0.001995 \\text{ m}^2$. The integral term $\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}$ is calculated as $2 \\left( \\frac{b_m}{t_h} + \\frac{h_m}{t_v} \\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{0.035}{0.003} + \\frac{0.057}{0.005} \\right) = 46.1334 \\text{ m}^{-1}$. Applying the angle of twist formula $\\phi = \\frac{T L}{4A_m^2 G} \\left( \\oint \\frac{ds}{t} \\right)$ and solving for $T$: $T = \\frac{\\phi \\times 4A_m^2 G}{L \\times \\oint \\frac{ds}{t}} = \\frac{0.0727 \\times 4 \\times (0.001995)^2 \\times (80 \\times 10^9)}{2 \\times 46.1334} \\approx 1004.57 \\text{ N-m}$. This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 990 to 1020 Nm."

        "Identify the problem as a thin-walled closed rectangular tube under torsion, requiring the Bredt-Batho theory.

Convert all dimensions to meters.",

These are the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the centerlines of the walls. $b_m = W_{outer} - t_v = 40 \\text{ mm} - 5 \\text{ mm} = 35 \\text{ mm} = 0.035 \\text{ m}$. $h_m = H_{outer} - t_h = 60 \\text{ mm} - 3 \\text{ mm} = 57 \\text{ mm} = 0.057 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Calculate the enclosed mid-thickness area ($A_m$). Compute the area enclosed by the mid-thickness perimeter: $A_m = b_m \\times h_m = (0.035 \\text{ m}) \\times (0.057 \\text{ m}) = 0.001995 \\text{ m}^2$.",
        "Calculate the torsional constant term ($\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}$). Evaluate the integral $\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}$ along the mid-thickness perimeter. Since the wall thicknesses are different for horizontal ($t_h$) and vertical ($t_v$) walls, this term is calculated as the sum of (length/thickness) for each segment: $\\oint \\frac{ds}{t} = 2 \\left( \\frac{b_m}{t_h} + \\frac{h_m}{t_v} \\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{0.035 \\text{ m}}{0.003 \\text{ m}} + \\frac{0.057 \\text{ m}}{0.005 \\text{ m}} \\right) = 2(11.6667 + 11.4) = 2(23.0667) = 46.1334 \\text{ m}^{-1}$.",
        "Apply the Bredt-Batho Angle of Twist Formula. The formula for the total angle of twist for thin-walled closed sections is $\\phi = \\frac{T L}{4A_m^2 G} \\left( \\oint \\frac{ds}{t} \\right)$.",

Calculating torsional stiffness ensures the wing does not twist excessively, which is crucial for maintaining control effectiveness, preventing aeroelastic phenomena, and ensuring structural integrity and safety.",
