This is a single impulse out-of-plane maneuver, which means the magnitude of the orbital velocity remains constant during the impulse, only its direction changes.\n\n1.  **Orbital Velocity:** For a circular orbit of radius $r$, the orbital speed is $V_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$, where $\\mu$ is the gravitational parameter. Since the radius is the same for both orbits, the orbital speed magnitude $V_c$ is constant.\n\n2.  **Change in Inclination:** The change in inclination is $\\Delta i = i_{final} - i_{initial} = 90^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.\n\n3.  **Required Change in Velocity ($\\Delta V$):** For a pure plane change maneuver at constant speed $V_c$, the required change in velocity is given by:\n    $\\Delta V = 2V_c \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta i}{2}\\right)$\n    Substituting $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$:\n    $\\Delta V = 2V_c \\sin\\left(\\frac{90^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 2V_c \\sin(45^\\circ) = 2V_c \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}V_c$\n\n4.  **Escape Velocity ($V_{escape}$):** The escape velocity from a radius $r$ is given by:\n    $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{r}}$\n    Relating this to the circular orbital velocity $V_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$:\n    $V_{escape} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}} = \\sqrt{2}V_c$\n\n5.  **Ratio Calculation:** The question asks for the ratio of the change in velocity to the escape velocity:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{escape}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V_c}{\\sqrt{2}V_c} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the change in velocity required is 1 times the magnitude of the escape velocity."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the initial and final orbital parameters and the nature of the maneuver. The satellite starts in a geostationary orbit (circular, equatorial, inclination $0^\\circ$, radius $r$) and transfers to a circular polar orbit (inclination $90^\\circ$, same radius $r$). The maneuver is a single impulse out-of-plane, implying a pure plane change where the magnitude of the orbital velocity remains constant.",
        "Step 2: Determine the orbital velocity. For any circular orbit, the orbital speed is given by $V_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$, where $\\mu$ is the gravitational parameter and $r$ is the orbital radius. Since the radius is the same for both orbits, the magnitude of the satellite's velocity before and after the maneuver is $V_c$.",
        "Recognize that the maneuver is a single impulse out-of-plane maneuver, changing the inclination from $0^\\circ$ (equatorial) to $90^\\circ$ (polar). Thus, the change in inclination is $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$. Since the orbital radius remains the same, the orbital speed magnitude $V$ also remains constant.",
        "Apply the formula for a pure inclination change: $\\Delta V = 2V \\sin(\\Delta i / 2)$. Substitute $\\Delta i = 90^\\circ$: $\\Delta V = 2V \\sin(90^\\circ / 2) = 2V \\sin(45^\\circ)$. Since $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we get $\\Delta V = 2V \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}V$.",
        "Next, determine the escape velocity ($V_{esc}$) at the same orbital radius $r$. The formula for escape velocity is $V_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{r}}$. We know that the circular orbital velocity is $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}}$. Therefore, we can express the escape velocity in terms of the orbital velocity: $V_{esc} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}} = \\sqrt{2}V$.",
        "Now, calculate the ratio of the required velocity change ($\\Delta V$) to the escape velocity ($V_{esc}$): $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{esc}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}V}{\\sqrt{2}V} = 1$. The ratio is 1.",
