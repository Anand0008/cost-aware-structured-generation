      "reasoning": "According to thin airfoil theory, for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered) at small angles of attack, the aerodynamic center (AC) is fixed at the quarter-chord point (c/4). This is because the pitching moment coefficient about the AC ($C_{m,ac}$) is constant and independent of the angle of attack (and thus, independent of lift). Therefore, a change in lift does not cause the AC to shift. However, for a cambered airfoil, the pitching moment coefficient about the quarter-chord ($C_{m,c/4}$) is a non-zero constant. The location of the center of pressure (CP) is given by the formula $x_{CP}/c = 0.25 - C_{m,c/4} / C_l$. Since $C_{m,c/4}$ is constant and non-zero for a cambered airfoil, and the lift coefficient ($C_l$) changes with the angle of attack (and thus with lift), the ratio $C_{m,c/4} / C_l$ will change. Consequently, the location of the center of pressure ($x_{CP}$) will shift as the lift changes. Thus, a change in lift leads to a shift of the center of pressure and no shift of the aerodynamic center."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify the airfoil type as a thin cambered airfoil and the relevant concepts: Aerodynamic Center (AC) and Center of Pressure (CP). Recognize that thin airfoil theory applies.",
        "Recall from thin airfoil theory that for any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the aerodynamic center (AC) is located at the quarter-chord point (c/4) and its pitching moment coefficient (C_{m,ac}) is constant and independent of the angle of attack or lift coefficient. This means the AC is a fixed point.",
        "Understand that for a cambered airfoil, the pitching moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center (C_{m,ac}) is constant but non-zero. This non-zero constant moment is crucial for the behavior of the center of pressure.",
        "Recall the relationship between the center of pressure (CP) and the aerodynamic center (AC): x_{CP}/c = x_{ac}/c - C_{m,ac}/C_l. Since x_{ac}/c = 0.25, this becomes x_{CP}/c = 0.25 - C_{m,ac}/C_l.",
        "A 'change in lift' implies a change in the lift coefficient (C_l). Given that C_{m,ac} is a constant non-zero value for a cambered airfoil, a change in C_l will directly cause the term C_{m,ac}/C_l to change.",
        "Therefore, the aerodynamic center (AC) does not shift because its pitching moment coefficient (C_{m,ac}) is constant and independent of lift. However, the center of pressure (CP) shifts because its location is dependent on the changing lift coefficient (C_l) and the non-zero constant pitching moment about the AC.",
        "This leads to the conclusion that a change in lift results in a shift of the center of pressure and no shift of the aerodynamic center."

Recall that for thin airfoils, AC is fixed at c/4, and for cambered airfoils, CP moves. If you know these definitions and behaviors, it's a fast answer; otherwise, mark for review.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, remember that the Aerodynamic Center (AC) is fixed for thin airfoils, while the Center of Pressure (CP) moves for cambered airfoils. Eliminate options where AC shifts or neither shifts, then choose the option where only CP moves.",
