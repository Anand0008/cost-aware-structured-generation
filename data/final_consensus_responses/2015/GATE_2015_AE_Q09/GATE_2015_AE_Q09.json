      "reasoning": "1.  **Understand the problem:** We need to construct a right triangle PQR where the right angle is at P, and line PR is parallel to the x-axis. All coordinates (P, Q, R) must be integers within the specified ranges: -4 <= x <= 5 and 6 <= y <= 16.\n2.  **Determine coordinate ranges:**\n    *   The number of possible integer x-values is $5 - (-4) + 1 = 10$.\n    *   The number of possible integer y-values is $16 - 6 + 1 = 11$.\n3.  **Analyze geometric constraints:**\n    *   Let P = $(x_P, y_P)$.\n    *   Since the right angle is at P and PR is parallel to the x-axis, this implies:\n        *   $y_R = y_P$ (PR is a horizontal line segment).\n        *   $x_R \\ne x_P$ (R must be distinct from P to form a non-degenerate segment).\n    *   For a right angle at P, PQ must be perpendicular to PR. Since PR is horizontal, PQ must be vertical. This implies:\n        *   $x_Q = x_P$ (PQ is a vertical line segment).\n        *   $y_Q \\ne y_P$ (Q must be distinct from P to form a non-degenerate segment).\n4.  **Count possibilities for each point:**\n    *   **Point P:** $x_P$ can be any of the 10 x-values, and $y_P$ can be any of the 11 y-values. So, there are $10 \\times 11 = 110$ possible locations for point P.\n    *   **Point R (given P):** $y_R$ must be equal to $y_P$ (1 choice). $x_R$ must be different from $x_P$. Since there are 10 total x-values, there are $10 - 1 = 9$ choices for $x_R$.\n    *   **Point Q (given P):** $x_Q$ must be equal to $x_P$ (1 choice). $y_Q$ must be different from $y_P$. Since there are 11 total y-values, there are $11 - 1 = 10$ choices for $y_Q$.\n5.  **Calculate total triangles:** The choices for P, R, and Q (relative to P) are independent. Therefore, we use the multiplication principle:\n    Total triangles = (Choices for P) $\\times$ (Choices for R given P) $\\times$ (Choices for Q given P)\n    Total triangles = $110 \\times 9 \\times 10 = 9900$.\nThis matches option C."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the geometry. Right angle at P and PR parallel to x-axis implies PQ is vertical (parallel to y-axis). So, points P, Q, R must satisfy: P=(x_P, y_P), Q=(x_P, y_Q) with y_Q ≠ y_P, R=(x_R, y_P) with x_R ≠ x_P.",
        "Step 2: Determine the range of integer coordinates. x can be any integer from -4 to 5 inclusive: total 10 values. y can be any integer from 6 to 16 inclusive: total 11 values.",
        "Step 3: Count choices for point P. Any (x, y) in the grid: 10 * 11 = 110 possible P.",
        "Step 4: For a fixed P, count choices for Q. Q must have the same x as P, and y must be in [6,16] but different from y_P. So, 11 - 1 = 10 choices for y_Q.",
        "Step 5: For the same fixed P, count choices for R. R must have the same y as P, and x must be in [-4,5] but different from x_P. So, 10 - 1 = 9 choices for x_R.",
        "Step 6: Compute total distinct triangles. Since choices for P, Q, R are independent given the constraints, total = (choices for P) * (choices for Q given P) * (choices for R given P) = 110 * 10 * 9 = 9900.",
        "Step 7: Verify no overcounting. Each triangle is uniquely defined by the triple (P, Q, R) because P is the right-angled vertex, Q is the vertical projection, and R is the horizontal projection. Swapping Q and R would violate the condition that PR is horizontal (it would make PQ horizontal)."
