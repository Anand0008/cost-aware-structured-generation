      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio of any two successive amplitudes in a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with viscous damping. This ratio is given by $e^{\\delta}$, where $\\delta$ is the logarithmic decrement. The logarithmic decrement depends on the damping ratio ($\\zeta$), which in turn is derived from the system's mass ($m$), spring stiffness ($k$), and damping coefficient ($c$).\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n1.  **Convert units to SI:**\n    *   $k = 2.25 \\text{ N/mm} = 2.25 \\times 1000 \\text{ N/m} = 2250 \\text{ N/m}$\n    *   $c = 0.0125 \\text{ N s/mm} = 0.0125 \\times 1000 \\text{ N s/m} = 12.5 \\text{ N s/m}$\n    *   $m = 10 \\text{ kg}$ (already in SI)\n2.  **Calculate the undamped natural frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    *   $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2250}{10}} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ rad/s}$\n3.  **Calculate the critical damping coefficient ($\\text{c}_c$):**\n    *   $c_c = 2 m \\omega_n = 2 \\times 10 \\text{ kg} \\times 15 \\text{ rad/s} = 300 \\text{ N s/m}$\n4.  **Calculate the damping ratio ($\\zeta$):**\n    *   $\\zeta = \\frac{c}{c_c} = \\frac{12.5 \\text{ N s/m}}{300 \\text{ N s/m}} \\approx 0.041667$\n5.  **Calculate the logarithmic decrement ($\\delta$):**\n    *   $\\delta = \\frac{2 \\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 0.041667}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.041667)^2}} = \\frac{0.261799}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.001736}} = \\frac{0.261799}{\\sqrt{0.998264}} \\approx \\frac{0.261799}{0.999131} \\approx 0.26202$\n6.  **Calculate the ratio of successive amplitudes ($\\frac{X_1}{X_2}$):**\n    *   $\\frac{X_1}{X_2} = e^{\\delta} = e^{0.26202} \\approx 1.300$\n\nThe calculated ratio of successive amplitudes is approximately 1.300, which falls within the acceptable range of 1.27 to 1.32."
