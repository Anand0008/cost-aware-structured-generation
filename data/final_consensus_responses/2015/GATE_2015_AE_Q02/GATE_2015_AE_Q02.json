        "Determine the required meaning for the blank. The context suggests the boy feels out of place, uncomfortable, or unfamiliar with his surroundings.",
        "Evaluate the provided options as potential idioms:\n- Option A: \"dog out of herd\" - Not a recognized English idiom.\n- Option B: \"sheep from the heap\" - Not a recognized English idiom.\n- Option C: \"fish out of water\" - This is a common idiom meaning someone who is in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation.\n- Option D: \"bird from the flock\" - Not a standard idiom for feeling out of place due to unfamiliarity.",
        "Select the idiom that best fits the context. \"A fish out of water\" perfectly describes someone feeling uncomfortable and out of place in a new environment.",
        "Conclude that 'fish out of water' is the correct idiom to complete the sentence, as it accurately conveys the boy's feeling of being in an alien environment.",
