      "reasoning": "The condition \"returns to its original undisturbed position in minimum possible time without overshooting\" defines critical damping, where the damping ratio (ζ) = 1. For critical damping, the damping coefficient (c) is equal to the critical damping coefficient (c_c). The formula for critical damping coefficient is c_c = 2mω_n. Given the mass m = 10 kg and the natural frequency ω_n = 13.2 rad/s, we can calculate c = c_c = 2 × 10 × 13.2 = 264 Ns/m. It is important to note that the given spring stiffness k = 17400 N/m is inconsistent with the given mass and natural frequency (√k/m = √(17400/10) = √1740 ≈ 41.71 rad/s ≠ 13.2 rad/s). In such cases, the explicitly stated natural frequency should be prioritized for calculations involving ω_n."
