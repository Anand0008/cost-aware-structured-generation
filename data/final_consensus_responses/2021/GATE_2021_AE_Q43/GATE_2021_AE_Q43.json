The calculation yields V_ex ≈ 606.83 m/s, which falls within the official answer range of 605-607 m/s. Key steps involve: 1) Setting up the overall energy balance per kg of air, correctly accounting for the fuel-air ratio (f) and the (1+f) factor for exhaust mass flow. 2) Converting all energy terms to consistent units (J/kg). 3) Solving the rearranged equation for the exhaust jet velocity."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the system as the entire turbojet engine (control volume from intake to nozzle exit). Apply the steady-flow energy equation (First Law of Thermodynamics) for a reacting system, which states that the rate of energy entering the control volume equals the rate of energy leaving it, accounting for heat loss. Note the given data: flight speed $V_0 = 270$ m/s, incoming air enthalpy $h_i = 260$ kJ/kg, exhaust gas enthalpy $h_e = 912$ kJ/kg, fuel-air ratio $f = 0.019$, fuel heating value $H = 44.5$ MJ/kg, and heat loss $q_{loss} = 25$ kJ per kg of air.",
        "Step 2: Formulate the Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE) for the overall engine. Considering mass flow rates of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) and fuel ($\\dot{m}_f$), and the total exhaust mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_g = \\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f = \\dot{m}_a(1+f)$), the energy balance is: $\\dot{m}_a (h_{in} + \\frac{V_{in}^2}{2}) + \\dot{m}_f Q_f = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f)(h_{ex} + \\frac{V_{ex}^2}{2}) + \\dot{m}_a Q_{loss}$. Divide the entire equation by the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) to express it in terms of specific quantities per kg of air: $(h_{in} + \\frac{V_{in}^2}{2}) + f Q_f = (1+f)(h_{ex} + \\frac{V_{ex}^2}{2}) + Q_{loss}$.",
        "Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for the exhaust jet velocity ($V_{ex}$). From the specific energy balance: $(1+f)(h_{ex} + \\frac{V_{ex}^2}{2}) = (h_{in} + \\frac{V_{in}^2}{2}) + f Q_f - Q_{loss}$. This leads to: $V_{ex} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{(1+f)} \\left[ (h_{in} + \\frac{V_{in}^2}{2}) + f Q_f - Q_{loss} - (1+f)h_{ex} \\right]}$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula. First, convert all energy terms to consistent units (Joules per kilogram, J/kg): $h_{in} = 260 \\times 10^3$ J/kg, $h_{ex} = 912 \\times 10^3$ J/kg, $Q_f = 44.5 \\times 10^6$ J/kg, $Q_{loss} = 25 \\times 10^3$ J/kg. Calculate the terms: Inlet kinetic energy: $\\frac{V_{in}^2}{2} = \\frac{270^2}{2} = 36450$ J/kg. Fuel energy input per kg of air: $f Q_f = 0.019 \\times 44.5 \\times 10^6 = 845500$ J/kg. Now substitute these values into the formula for $V_{ex}$: $V_{ex} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{(1+0.019)} \\left[ (260000 + 36450) + 845500 - 25000 - (1+0.019) \\times 912000 \\right]}$. $V_{ex} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{1.019} \\left[ 296450 + 845500 - 25000 - 929328 \\right]}$. $V_{ex} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{1.019} \\left[ 187622 \\right]} = \\sqrt{368247.3} \\approx 606.83$ m/s. Rounding off to two decimal places, the velocity of the exhaust jet is $606.83$ m/s.",
        "Convert all given values to consistent units (J/kg): inlet enthalpy h_in=260,000 J/kg, exhaust enthalpy h_ex=912,000 J/kg, fuel heating value Q_f=44,500,000 J/kg, specific heat loss Q_loss=25,000 J/kg, inlet velocity V_in=270 m/s (so kinetic energy V_in^2/2 = 36,450 J/kg), and fuel-air ratio f=0.019.",
        "Substitute these numerical values into the overall engine energy balance equation: (260,000 + 36,450) + 0.019*44,500,000 = (1+0.019)*(912,000 + V_ex^2/2) + 25,000. This simplifies to 296,450 + 845,500 = 1.019*(912,000 + V_ex^2/2) + 25,000, which is 1,141,950 = 1.019*(912,000 + V_ex^2/2) + 25,000.",
        "Solve the equation for V_ex: 1,141,950 - 25,000 = 1,116,950 = 1.019*(912,000 + V_ex^2/2). Divide by 1.019: 912,000 + V_ex^2/2 = 1,116,950 / 1.019 \\approx 1,096,123.65. Then, V_ex^2/2 = 1,096,123.65 - 912,000 = 184,123.65. This gives V_ex^2 = 368,247.3, so V_ex = \\sqrt{368,247.3} \\approx 606.86 m/s. Rounding to two decimal places, V_ex \\approx 606.86 m/s."
