      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements relating flow properties between a 'Moving Shock Problem' (lab frame) and a 'Stationary Shock Problem' (shock-fixed frame), where the shock moves into a stationary gas in the lab frame.\n\nLet's denote properties in the lab frame as $P_1, T_1, \\rho_1, P_{01}, T_{01}$ (upstream) and $P_2, T_2, \\rho_2, P_{02}, T_{02}$ (downstream). In the shock-fixed frame, these are $P_1', T_1', \\rho_1', P_{01}', T_{01}'$ (upstream) and $P_2', T_2', \\rho_2', P_{02}', T_{02}'$ (downstream).\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1.  **Static Properties:** Static pressure ($P$), temperature ($T$), and density ($\\rho$) are independent of the frame of reference. Therefore, $P_1' = P_1$, $T_1' = T_1$, $\\rho_1' = \\rho_1$, and $P_2' = P_2$, $T_2' = T_2$, $\\rho_2' = \\rho_2$.\n2.  **Upstream Velocity:** In the lab frame, the gas ahead of the shock is stationary, so $V_1 = 0$. In the shock-fixed frame, the gas approaches the stationary shock with a velocity equal to the shock speed, $V_1' = V_s$.\n3.  **Stagnation Properties:** Stagnation properties ($P_0, T_0$) depend on the velocity relative to the observer. They are defined as the properties if the flow were brought isentropically to rest.\n    *   For the stationary gas in the lab frame ($V_1=0$): $P_{01} = P_1$ and $T_{01} = T_1$.\n    *   For the gas approaching the stationary shock in the shock-fixed frame ($V_1' = V_s > 0$): $P_{01}' = P_1' (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$ and $T_{01}' = T_1' (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)$. Since $M_1' = V_s/a_1 > 1$ (for a shock), it implies $P_{01}' > P_1'$ and $T_{01}' > T_1'$.\n    *   Comparing stagnation properties between frames: Since $P_1' = P_1$ and $T_1' = T_1$, it follows that $P_{01}' > P_{01}$ and $T_{01}' > T_{01}$.\n4.  **Across a Normal Shock:** Pressure, temperature, and density always increase across a normal shock. So, $P_2 > P_1$, $T_2 > T_1$, $\\rho_2 > \\rho_1$.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. $T_1' > T_1$, $T_{01}' > T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' > \\rho_1'$**\n    *   $T_1' > T_1$: False. Static temperature is frame-independent, so $T_1' = T_1$.\n\n*   **B. $T_1' = T_1$, $T_2' < T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' = \\rho_2$**\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True.\n    *   $T_2' < T_{01}$: False. We know $T_2' = T_2$ and $T_{01} = T_1$. Across a shock, $T_2 > T_1$. So $T_2' > T_{01}$.\n\n*   **C. $T_1' < T_1$, $p_1' > p_1$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$, $\\rho_2' > \\rho_1$**\n    *   $T_1' < T_1$: False. Static temperature is frame-independent, so $T_1' = T_1$.\n    *   $p_1' > p_1$: False. Static pressure is frame-independent, so $p_1' = p_1$.\n\n*   **D. $T_1' = T_1$, $p_2 > p_{01}$, $T_{01}' > T_{01}$, $p_{01}' > p_{01}$**\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True. Static temperature is frame-independent.\n    *   $p_2 > p_{01}$: True. Since $V_1=0$, $p_{01} = p_1$. Across a normal shock, static pressure always increases, so $p_2 > p_1$. Thus, $p_2 > p_{01}$.\n    *   $T_{01}' > T_{01}$: True. As derived above, since $V_1' = V_s > 0$ and $V_1 = 0$, the stagnation temperature in the shock-fixed frame upstream ($T_{01}'$) will be greater than the stagnation temperature in the lab frame upstream ($T_{01}$). Specifically, $T_{01}' = T_1 + \\frac{V_s^2}{2C_p}$ while $T_{01} = T_1$.\n    *   $p_{01}' > p_{01}$: True. As derived above, since $V_1' = V_s > 0$ and $V_1 = 0$, the stagnation pressure in the shock-fixed frame upstream ($P_{01}'$) will be greater than the stagnation pressure in the lab frame upstream ($P_{01}$). Specifically, $P_{01}' = P_1 (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1'^2)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$ while $P_{01} = P_1$.\n\nAll statements in option D are true."

        "Identify the two reference frames: the 'Moving Shock Problem' (lab frame, where the shock moves into stationary gas) and the 'Stationary Shock Problem' (shock-fixed frame, where the shock is stationary and the gas approaches it). Understand the notation (unprimed for lab frame, primed for shock-fixed frame) as shown in the figure.",
        "Establish the behavior of static properties (pressure P, temperature T, density \\rho) during a frame transformation. Static properties are thermodynamic properties and are independent of the observer's frame of reference. Therefore, for both upstream and downstream conditions: P' = P, T' = T, \\rho' = \\rho.",
        "Analyze stagnation properties (P_0, T_0). Stagnation properties depend on the kinetic energy of the flow relative to the observer. In the lab frame, the upstream gas is stationary (V_1 = 0), so its stagnation properties are equal to its static properties: P_01 = P_1 and T_01 = T_1. In the shock-fixed frame, the upstream gas approaches the stationary shock with a velocity V'_1 = V_s (the shock speed). Since V_s > 0, this kinetic energy contributes to the stagnation properties. Therefore, T'_01 > T_01 and P'_01 > P_01. Specifically, T'_01 = T'_1 + V_s^2/(2C_p) = T_1 + V_s^2/(2C_p) and P'_01 = P'_1 (1 + (\\gamma-1)/2 M'_1^2)^(\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)).",
        "Compare the upstream stagnation properties between the two frames. In the shock-fixed frame, the upstream gas approaches the shock at speed Vs, making its stagnation temperature and pressure ($T_{01}'$, $P_{01}'$) higher than the static values ($T_1'$, $P_1'$). Since static properties are frame-independent ($T_1' = T_1$, $P_1' = P_1$) and the upstream gas in the lab frame is at rest ($T_{01} = T_1$, $P_{01} = P_1$), it follows that $T_{01}' > T_{01}$ and $P_{01}' > P_{01}$.",
        "Recall the property changes across a normal shock. Across a normal shock, static pressure, temperature, and density always increase. Thus, $P_2 > P_1$, $T_2 > T_1$, and $\\rho_2 > \\rho_1$. Since the upstream gas in the lab frame is at rest, $P_{01} = P_1$, which implies $P_2 > P_{01}$.",
        "Evaluate each statement based on the established principles. For example, considering the correct option (D):\n    *   $T_1' = T_1$: True, as static properties are independent of the reference frame.\n    *   $p_2 > p_{01}$: True, because $p_{01} = p_1$ (upstream gas at rest in lab frame) and static pressure increases across a normal shock ($p_2 > p_1$).\n    *   $T_{01}' > T_{01}$: True, as stagnation temperature increases due to the relative velocity in the shock-fixed frame.\n    *   $p_{01}' > p_{01}$: True, as stagnation pressure increases due to the relative velocity in the shock-fixed frame.",
        "Confirm that only the option stating $T_1' = T_1$, $p_2 > p_{01}$, $T_{01}' > T_{01}$, and $p_{01}' > p_{01}$ is consistent with the physics of normal shocks and frame transformations.",
