        "Identify the system and given data. Two cantilever beams, AB (length $L_{AB} = 400 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.4 \\, \\text{m}$) and DC (length $L_{DC} = 250 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}$), are connected by a roller at their free ends. Beam AB is subjected to a uniformly distributed load ($w = 20 \\, \\text{kN/m} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N/m}$). Both beams have a square cross-section ($50 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 50 \\, \\text{mm}$) and an elastic modulus ($E = 70 \\, \\text{GPa} = 70 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N/m}^2$). The problem requires finding the compressive force in the roller, which implies a statically indeterminate analysis using compatibility of deflections.",
        "Calculate the area moment of inertia ($I$) for the square cross-section. For a square section with side $b$, $I = \\frac{b^4}{12}$. Convert dimensions to meters: $b = 50 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.05 \\, \\text{m}$. So, $I = \\frac{(0.05 \\, \\text{m})^4}{12} = 5.20833 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}^4$.",
        "Recall the standard deflection formulas for a cantilever beam: 1. Deflection at the free end due to a uniformly distributed load ($w$) over length $L$: $\\delta_{UDL} = \\frac{wL^4}{8EI}$. 2. Deflection at the free end due to a concentrated point load ($P$) at the free end: $\\delta_{PL} = \\frac{PL^3}{3EI}$. Apply the principle of superposition and compatibility: The net downward deflection of beam AB at its free end (due to UDL and the upward roller force F) must be equal to the downward deflection of beam DC at its free end (due to the downward roller force F).",
        "Formulate the compatibility equation. The roller ensures that the net vertical deflection at point B (of beam AB) is equal to the vertical deflection at point C (of beam DC). Let $F$ be the compressive force exerted by the roller. This force acts upwards on beam AB at B and downwards on beam DC at C. The net downward deflection of B is $\\Delta_B = \\delta_{AB,w} - \\delta_{AB,F}$, where $\\delta_{AB,w}$ is the downward deflection due to UDL and $\\delta_{AB,F}$ is the upward deflection due to $F$. The downward deflection of C is $\\Delta_C = \\delta_{DC,F}$. The compatibility condition is $\\Delta_B = \\Delta_C$.",
        "Substitute the standard cantilever beam deflection formulas into the compatibility equation. For beam AB, the UDL causes downward deflection at B, while the roller force $F$ on AB is upward, giving an upward deflection contribution. Thus, the net downward deflection at B is $\\delta_B = \\frac{w L_{AB}^4}{8EI} - \\frac{F L_{AB}^3}{3EI}$. For beam DC, the roller force $F$ acts downward at C, giving $\\delta_C = \\frac{F L_{DC}^3}{3EI}$.",
        "Equate the deflections at the roller contact point: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8EI} - \\frac{F L_{AB}^3}{3EI} = \\frac{F L_{DC}^3}{3EI}$. Since $E$ and $I$ are the same for both beams, they can be cancelled out: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8} - \\frac{F L_{AB}^3}{3} = \\frac{F L_{DC}^3}{3}$.",
        "Solve for the unknown roller force $F$. Rearrange the equation: $\\frac{wL_{AB}^4}{8} = F \\left( \\frac{L_{AB}^3}{3} + \\frac{L_{DC}^3}{3} \\right) \\implies F = \\frac{3wL_{AB}^4}{8(L_{AB}^3 + L_{DC}^3)}$.",
        "Substitute the given numerical values: $w = 20 \\text{ kN/m} = 20000 \\text{ N/m}$, $L_{AB} = 400 \\text{ mm} = 0.4 \\text{ m}$, and $L_{DC} = 250 \\text{ mm} = 0.25 \\text{ m}$.

        "Convert to kN and round off. $F \\approx 2.4113 \\, \\text{kN}$. Rounding to one decimal place, the compressive force experienced by the roller is $2.4 \\, \\text{kN}$."
