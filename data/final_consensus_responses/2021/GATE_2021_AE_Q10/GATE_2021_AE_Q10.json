      "reasoning": "In a uniaxial tension test, a pulling force is applied along the longitudinal axis of the specimen. We need to determine the planes where maximum normal (tensile) stress and maximum shear stress occur, and then relate these to the failure characteristics of brittle and ductile materials.\n\n1.  **Stress State in Uniaxial Tension:** When a material is subjected to uniaxial tension (say, along the horizontal axis as implied by the arrows in the figure):\n    *   The maximum normal (tensile) stress occurs on planes perpendicular to the loading axis. In the given figure, the `x-x` plane is shown as perpendicular to the horizontal loading direction.\n    *   The maximum shear stress occurs on planes oriented at 45 degrees to the loading axis. In the given figure, the `y-y` plane is shown at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal loading direction.\n\n2.  **Failure of Brittle Materials:** Brittle materials (e.g., cast iron, ceramics) are inherently weak in tension and tend to fail by fracture when the maximum principal tensile stress reaches their ultimate tensile strength (as per Rankine's Maximum Principal Stress Theory). Therefore, a brittle material under uniaxial tension will fail along the plane where the maximum normal tensile stress is acting, which is the `x-x` plane.\n\n3.  **Failure of Ductile Materials:** Ductile materials (e.g., mild steel, aluminum) are generally weaker in shear than in tension/compression. They tend to fail by yielding (plastic deformation) and then fracture when the maximum shear stress reaches their shear yield strength (as per Tresca or von Mises criteria). Therefore, a ductile material under uniaxial tension will fail along the plane where the maximum shear stress is acting, which is the `y-y` plane.\n\nCombining these points, failure would initiate along `x-x` in brittle material and along `y-y` in ductile material, which corresponds to option B."

Recall the associated critical stress (normal for brittle, shear for ductile) and its plane of action. Match with the diagram, remembering that brittle fails perpendicular to the load and ductile at 45°.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If completely stuck, remember that brittle materials are generally associated with 'clean' breaks (often perpendicular to tension), and ductile materials with 'shearing' or 'tearing' (often at 45 degrees). This might help narrow down options by pairing brittle with normal stress and ductile with shear.",

For uniaxial tension `$\\sigma_x = \\sigma$`, `$\\sigma_y = 0$`, `$\\tau_{xy} = 0$`, the circle has its center at `$(\\sigma/2, 0)$` and a radius of `$\\sigma/2$`. The points on the circle directly show the normal and shear stresses on planes at various angles. The maximum normal stress is at `$(\\sigma, 0)$` (corresponding to `$\\theta = 0$`, i.e., perpendicular to loading), and the maximum shear stress is at `$(0, \\pm \\sigma/2)$` (corresponding to `$\\theta = 45^\\circ$` from the loading axis).",
