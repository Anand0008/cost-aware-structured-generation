The plural subject \"Arun’s families\" requires a plural verb (\"are\"), not the singular \"is\". Additionally, the use of 'families' in this context might be considered non-standard unless multiple distinct family groups are implied.\nSentence (iv) \"Arun’s family is here.\" is grammatically correct. \"Family\" is a singular collective noun acting as a single unit, and it correctly uses the singular verb \"is\".\nTherefore, sentences (i) and (iv) are grammatically correct, making option B the correct answer."

        "Identify the subject and verb in each sentence.

Collective nouns like 'family' can take a singular verb when considered as a single unit.",
        "Analyze sentence (i) 'Arun and Aparna are here.' The subject 'Arun and Aparna' is a compound subject, making it plural. The verb 'are' is also plural. Thus, the subject-verb agreement is correct, and sentence (i) is grammatically correct.",
        "Analyze sentence (ii) 'Arun and Aparna is here.' The subject 'Arun and Aparna' is plural, but the verb 'is' is singular. This violates subject-verb agreement, making sentence (ii) grammatically incorrect.",
        "Analyze sentence (iii) 'Arun’s families is here.' The subject 'Arun’s families' contains the plural noun 'families'. The verb 'is' is singular. This is a subject-verb agreement error, making sentence (iii) grammatically incorrect. The use of 'families' in this context is also somewhat unusual.",
        "Analyze sentence (iv) 'Arun’s family is here.' The subject 'Arun’s family' uses 'family' as a singular collective noun, referring to the group as a single unit. The verb 'is' is also singular. Thus, the subject-verb agreement is correct, and sentence (iv) is grammatically correct.",
        "Based on the analysis, sentences (i) and (iv) are grammatically correct, while sentences (ii) and (iii) are incorrect due to subject-verb agreement errors."
