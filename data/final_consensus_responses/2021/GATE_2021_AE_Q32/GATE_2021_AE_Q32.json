      "reasoning": "The free vibration response of an undamped multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system with zero initial velocity is given by the superposition of its normal modes, where the contribution of each mode is determined by the initial displacement. The general solution for displacement $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ is given by $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i A_i \\cos(\\omega_i t)$, where $\\mathbf{\\phi}_i$ are the mode shapes, $\\omega_i$ are the natural frequencies, and $A_i$ are constants determined by the initial displacement $\\mathbf{x}(0)$. Specifically, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i A_i$. If the initial displacement $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ is proportional to a specific mode shape $\\mathbf{\\phi}_k$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{x}(0) = c \\mathbf{\\phi}_k$ for some constant $c$), then only that mode will be excited, meaning $A_k \\neq 0$ and all other $A_i = 0$ for $i \\neq k$. If $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ is not proportional to any single mode shape, then multiple modes will be excited, leading to a linear combination of oscillations at their respective natural frequencies.\n\nGiven:\nMode shape 1: $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = [1, -3.16]^T$\nMode shape 2: $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2 = [1, 3.16]^T$\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** Initial deflection $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [6.32, -3.16]^T$\nThe ratio of $x_2(0)$ to $x_1(0)$ is $\\frac{-3.16}{6.32} = -0.5$.\nThis ratio is not equal to the ratio for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$ (which is $-3.16/1 = -3.16$) nor for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2$ (which is $3.16/1 = 3.16$). Therefore, this initial deflection will excite a linear combination of both modes. The statement that it would oscillate with *only* the second natural frequency is **False**.\n\n**Option B:** Initial deflection $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [2, -6.32]^T$\nThe ratio of $x_2(0)$ to $x_1(0)$ is $\\frac{-6.32}{2} = -3.16$.\nThis ratio matches the ratio for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = [1, -3.16]^T$. Specifically, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{\\phi}_1$. Therefore, this initial deflection will make the system oscillate with *only* the first natural frequency. The statement is **True**.\n\n**Option C:** Initial deflection $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [2, -2]^T$\nThe ratio of $x_2(0)$ to $x_1(0)$ is $\\frac{-2}{2} = -1$.\nThis ratio is not equal to the ratio for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$ (which is $-3.16$) nor for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2$ (which is $3.16$). Therefore, this initial deflection will excite a linear combination of both modes. The statement is **True**.\n\n**Option D:** Initial deflection $\\mathbf{x}(0) = [1, -6.32]^T$\nThe ratio of $x_2(0)$ to $x_1(0)$ is $\\frac{-6.32}{1} = -6.32$.\nThis ratio is not equal to the ratio for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$ (which is $-3.16$) nor for $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2$ (which is $3.16$). Therefore, this initial deflection will excite a linear combination of both modes.

        "Step 1: Identify the given natural frequencies and mode shapes. Recall the general solution for free vibration of an undamped multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system. For zero initial velocities, the response simplifies to a superposition of mode shapes, each oscillating at its natural frequency, with amplitudes determined solely by the initial displacements.",
        "Recall the general form of the displacement vector for an undamped MDOF system with zero initial velocity: $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i A_i \\cos(\\omega_i t)$. With zero initial velocities, the initial displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ alone determines which modes are excited.",
        "Apply the initial displacement condition at $t=0$: $\\mathbf{x}(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{\\phi}_i A_i$. For a single mode to be excited, the initial displacement $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ must be exactly proportional to that mode shape vector, i.e., $\\mathbf{x}(0) = c \\mathbf{\\phi}_k$ for some scalar $c$.",
        "For the system to oscillate with *only* a specific natural frequency $\\omega_k$, the initial displacement $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ must be proportional to the corresponding mode shape $\\mathbf{\\phi}_k$. This means the ratio of the components of $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ must match the ratio of the components of $\\mathbf{\\phi}_k$. For mode 1, $\\phi_1=[1,-3.16]^T$, so $x_2/x_1=-3.16$. For mode 2, $\\phi_2=[1,3.16]^T$, so $x_2/x_1=3.16$.",

        "If the calculated ratio matches the ratio of $\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$, then only the first natural frequency is excited. If it matches $\\mathbf{\\phi}_2$, then only the second natural frequency is excited. If it matches neither, then both frequencies are excited (a linear combination).",
