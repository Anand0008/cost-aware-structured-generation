        "Step 3: Calculate the partial derivatives: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x + 3y) = 2$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x + 2y) = 2$.",

      "Mathematics": "Vector calculus, including divergence and curl, is a core topic in multivariable calculus with applications across physics and engineering.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "Divergence relates to the continuity equation for incompressible flow ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0$). Curl relates to vorticity ($\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}$), which is a measure of local fluid rotation, crucial for characterizing fluid flow behavior like vortices and flow separation.",
      "Mathematics (Vector Calculus)": "These are fundamental operations in vector calculus, essential for understanding vector fields, line integrals, surface integrals, and volume integrals (e.g., Gauss's Divergence Theorem, Stokes' Theorem)."
