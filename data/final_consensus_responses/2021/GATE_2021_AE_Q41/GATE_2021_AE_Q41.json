      "Flight Mechanics": "Induced drag affects aircraft performance parameters like climb rate, range, and endurance.",
      "Aircraft Design": "Wing aspect ratio and planform selection, along with wing twist and camber distribution, are key design choices influenced by minimizing induced drag and achieving efficient lift distribution, often trading against structural weight.",
      "Aircraft Performance": "Induced drag is a critical component in aircraft performance calculations, directly influencing parameters such as range, endurance, climb rate, and maximum speed. Minimizing induced drag is essential for optimizing aircraft efficiency.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The concept of induced drag is fundamentally tied to fluid mechanics principles such as fluid flow, circulation, vortex theory (e.g., Kutta-Joukowski theorem, Helmholtz's vortex theorems), and the generation of trailing wingtip vortices."
