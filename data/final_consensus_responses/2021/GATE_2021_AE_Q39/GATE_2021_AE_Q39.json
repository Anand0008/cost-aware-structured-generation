      "reasoning": "To find the location of maximum deflection, we need to find the point where the slope of the beam is zero. This is achieved by differentiating the given deflection equation with respect to $x$ and setting the derivative to zero.\nGiven deflection equation:\n$y = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2x^4 - 3lx^3 + l^3x)$\n\nStep 1: Differentiate $y$ with respect to $x$ to find the slope $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{w}{48EI} (2x^4 - 3lx^3 + l^3x) \\right]$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{w}{48EI} (8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3)$\n\nStep 2: Set the slope to zero to find the locations of maximum/minimum deflection:\n$\\frac{w}{48EI} (8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3) = 0$\nSince $\\frac{w}{48EI}$ is a non-zero constant, we must have:\n$8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3 = 0$\n\nStep 3: Convert to a non-dimensional form. Let $X = \\frac{x}{l}$, so $x = Xl$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$8(Xl)^3 - 9l(Xl)^2 + l^3 = 0$\n$8X^3l^3 - 9X^2l^3 + l^3 = 0$\nDivide the entire equation by $l^3$ (assuming $l \\neq 0$):\n$8X^3 - 9X^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nStep 4: Solve the cubic equation for $X$. We can test for simple roots. Notice that if $X=1$, $8(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 1 = 8 - 9 + 1 = 0$. So, $X=1$ is a root. This means $(X-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.\nPerform polynomial division or synthetic division:\n$(8X^3 - 9X^2 + 1) \\div (X-1) = 8X^2 - X - 1$\nSo, the equation becomes: $(X-1)(8X^2 - X - 1) = 0$\n\nStep 5: Solve the quadratic equation $8X^2 - X - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $X = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$X = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(-1)}}{2(8)}$\n$X = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 32}}{16}$\n$X = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{16}$\n\nStep 6: Calculate the numerical values for the roots:\n$\\sqrt{33} \\approx 5.74456$\n$X_1 = \\frac{1 + 5.74456}{16} = \\frac{6.74456}{16} \\approx 0.421535$\n$X_2 = \\frac{1 - 5.74456}{16} = \\frac{-4.74456}{16} \\approx -0.296535$\n\nStep 7: Identify the physically meaningful root. The possible non-dimensional locations where the slope is zero are $X=1$, $X \\approx 0.4215$, and $X \\approx -0.2965$. Since $x$ is the distance from the point of support, $0 \\le x \\le l$, which means $0 \\le X \\le 1$. The root $X=-0.2965$ is not physically relevant.\nAt $X=1$ (i.e., $x=l$), the deflection $y = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2l^4 - 3l(l)^3 + l^3(l)) = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2l^4 - 3l^4 + l^4) = 0$. This is a support point where deflection is zero, not maximum.\nTherefore, the location of maximum deflection must be $X \\approx 0.4215$.\n\nStep 8: Round off the result to two decimal places.\n$X \\approx 0.42$"

        "Step 1: Identify the given deflection equation for the beam, $y = \\frac{w}{48EI} (2x^4 - 3lx^3 + l^3x)$, and the goal to find the non-dimensional location $x/l$ where the deflection $y$ is maximum.",
        "Step 2: To find the maximum deflection, recognize that the slope of the deflection curve must be zero. Differentiate the deflection equation $y(x)$ with respect to $x$: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{w}{48EI} (8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3)$.",
        "Step 3: Set the first derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ to zero to find the critical points (locations of maximum or minimum deflection): $8x^3 - 9lx^2 + l^3 = 0$.",
        "Step 4: Introduce the non-dimensional variable $\\xi = x/l$. Substitute $x = \\xi l$ into the cubic equation: $8(\\xi l)^3 - 9l(\\xi l)^2 + l^3 = 0$. This simplifies to $8\\xi^3 l^3 - 9\\xi^2 l^3 + l^3 = 0$. Divide by $l^3$ (since $l \\neq 0$) to get the non-dimensional cubic equation: $8\\xi^3 - 9\\xi^2 + 1 = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the cubic equation $8\\xi^3 - 9\\xi^2 + 1 = 0$. By inspection, test for integer roots like $\\xi=1$: $8(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 1 = 8 - 9 + 1 = 0$. Thus, $(\\xi - 1)$ is a factor. Perform polynomial division or synthetic division to factor the cubic equation: $(\\xi - 1)(8\\xi^2 - \\xi - 1) = 0$.",
        "Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation $8\\xi^2 - \\xi - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $\\xi = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$: $\\xi = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(-1)}}{2(8)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 32}}{16} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{16}$.",
        "Step 7: Evaluate the roots: $\\xi_1 = 1$, $\\xi_2 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{16} \\approx \\frac{1 + 5.7446}{16} \\approx 0.4215$, and $\\xi_3 = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{33}}{16} \\approx \\frac{1 - 5.7446}{16} \\approx -0.2965$. Since $x/l$ must be between 0 and 1 for a point within the beam span, we consider $\\xi_2 \\approx 0.4215$. The root $\\xi_1 = 1$ corresponds to a support where deflection is zero. The root $\\xi_3$ is negative and outside the beam span. Therefore, the non-dimensional location of maximum deflection is approximately $0.4215$.",
