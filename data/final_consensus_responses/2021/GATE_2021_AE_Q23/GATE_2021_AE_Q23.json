Given the parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$, the condition for $(L/D)_{\\text{max}}$ occurs when $C_{D_0} = K C_L^2$. This implies $C_L = \\sqrt{C_{D_0}/K}$.\n\nGiven:\n$C_D = 0.02 + 0.04 C_L^2 \\implies C_{D_0} = 0.02, K = 0.04$\nWing loading $W/S = 1800 \\text{ N/m}^2$\nDensity of air $\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n\n1.  **Calculate $C_L$ for maximum endurance:**\n    $C_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{D_0}}{K}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{0.04}} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.7071$\n    This value ($0.7071$) is less than $C_{L,max} = 1.6$, so it is achievable.\n\n2.  **Calculate the speed $V$ using the lift equation:**\n    For steady, level flight, Lift = Weight ($L=W$).\n    The lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$.\n    Dividing by wing area $S$ gives the wing loading relationship:\n    $\\frac{W}{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_L$\n    Rearranging for $V$:\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (W/S)}{\\rho C_L}}$\n\n3.  **Substitute the values and calculate V:**\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1800 \\text{ N/m}^2}{1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.7071}}$\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{3600}{0.8662975}} = \\sqrt{4155.51} \\approx 64.463 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the speed is $64.46 \\text{ m/s}$.

        "Step 1: Recognize that for a jet aircraft, maximum endurance in steady level flight occurs when the aircraft flies at the speed that maximizes the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D).",
        "Step 2: Given the parabolic drag polar $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$, the condition for maximum L/D is $C_{D_0} = K C_L^2$. Calculate the optimal lift coefficient: $C_L = \\sqrt{C_{D_0}/K} = \\sqrt{0.02/0.04} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.7071$.",
        "Step 3: Verify that this calculated $C_L$ (approximately 0.7071) is less than the maximum lift coefficient $C_{L,max} = 1.6$, confirming it's an achievable flight condition.",
        "Step 4: For steady, level flight, lift equals weight ($L=W$). Using the lift equation $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$, and knowing that $W/S$ is the wing loading, we can write $W/S = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_L$.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the equation from Step 4 to solve for velocity $V$: $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (W/S)}{\\rho C_L}}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the numerical values: wing loading $W/S = 1800 \\text{ N/m}^2$, air density $\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, and the calculated $C_L \\approx 0.7071$. Compute $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1800}{1.225 \\times 0.7071}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{3600}{0.8662}} \\approx \\sqrt{4155.99} \\approx 64.46 \\text{ m/s}$.",
