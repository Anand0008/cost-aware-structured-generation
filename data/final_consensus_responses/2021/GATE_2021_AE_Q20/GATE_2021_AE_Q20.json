        "Step 1: Identify the system parameters. We have two uniform cantilever beams made of the same homogeneous material (constant Young's modulus $E$ and density $\\rho$) and identical cross-sections (constant area moment of inertia $I$ and cross-sectional area $A$). They differ only in length: Beam 1 has length $l$, and Beam 2 has length $2l$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the formula for the fundamental natural frequency of a uniform cantilever beam (neglecting shear and rotary inertia). The angular frequency for the $n$-th mode is given by: $\\omega_n = (\\beta_n L)^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A L^4}}$, where $(\\beta_1 L) \\approx 1.875$ for the first mode of a cantilever beam.",
        "Step 3: Determine the proportionality of the natural frequency with respect to length. Since $E$, $I$, $\\rho$, and $A$ are constant for both beams, the formula simplifies to $\\omega_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$.",
        "Step 4: Set up the ratio of the natural frequencies. Let $\\omega_1$ be the natural frequency of Beam 1 (length $L_1 = l$) and $\\omega_2$ be the natural frequency of Beam 2 (length $L_2 = 2l$). The ratio can be written as $\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega_2} = \\frac{C/L_1^2}{C/L_2^2} = \\frac{L_2^2}{L_1^2}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given lengths into the ratio and calculate the numerical value. $\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega_2} = \\frac{(2l)^2}{l^2} = \\frac{4l^2}{l^2} = 4$.",
