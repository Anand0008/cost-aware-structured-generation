To solve the expression `(9 ⊖ (6 ⊕ 7)) ⊖ (7 ⊕ (6 ⊖ 5))`, we must follow the order of operations (parentheses first) and apply these definitions step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Evaluate the innermost parentheses:**\n    *   `6 ⊕ 7`: Using `p ⊕ q = p × q`, we get `6 × 7 = 42`.\n    *   `6 ⊖ 5`: Using `p ⊖ q = p - q`, we get `6 - 5 = 1`.\n\n2.  **Substitute these results back into the main expression:**\n    The expression becomes `(9 ⊖ 42) ⊖ (7 ⊕ 1)`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the remaining parentheses:**\n    *   `9 ⊖ 42`: Using `p ⊖ q = p - q`, we get `9 - 42 = -33`.\n    *   `7 ⊕ 1`: Using `p ⊕ q = p × q`, we get `7 × 1 = 7`.\n\n4.  **Substitute these results back:**\n    The expression becomes `(-33) ⊖ 7`.\n\n5.  **Perform the final operation:**\n    *   `(-33) ⊖ 7`: Using `p ⊖ q = p - q`, we get `-33 - 7 = -40`.\n\nThe final result is -40."
