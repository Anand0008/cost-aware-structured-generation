      "reasoning": "In the ideal Brayton cycle, which is the theoretical model for gas turbine engines like the turbo-shaft engine, the combustion process is idealized as a constant pressure (isobaric) heat addition. This is a defining feature of the ideal Brayton cycle and simplifies thermodynamic analysis for theoretical performance benchmarks. The question specifies 'ideal operation', meaning real-world pressure drops are neglected. Retrieved knowledge confirms this, stating 'Combustion (02-03): Heat is added to the air at constant stagnation pressure' and that flow through the combustor in an ideal cycle is an isobaric process."

        "Step 3: Focus on the combustion process. In the ideal Brayton cycle, the combustion chamber is where heat is added to the working fluid. This process is modeled as occurring at a constant pressure.",

Other options like isentropic (no heat transfer), isochoric (constant volume, typical of Otto cycle), and isothermal (constant temperature, not applicable for combustion) do not accurately represent the combustion process in an ideal gas turbine cycle.",
