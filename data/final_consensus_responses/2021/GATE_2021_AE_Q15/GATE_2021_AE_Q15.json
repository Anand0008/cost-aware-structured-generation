      "reasoning": "The Kutta condition is a fundamental principle in classical potential flow theory for airfoils, designed to make the mathematical solutions physically realistic. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A. It is utilized to determine the circulation on an airfoil.** This statement is **TRUE**. The Kutta condition uniquely determines the amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) generated around an airfoil, which is essential for calculating lift via the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. Without it, potential flow theory would predict an infinite number of possible circulation values.\n\n*   **B. It is applicable only to airfoils with sharp trailing edge.** This statement is **TRUE**. The Kutta condition is specifically formulated to address the unphysical infinite velocity predicted by potential flow theory at a sharp corner (the trailing edge). For blunt bodies, flow separation occurs differently and is not governed by this condition. Even for cusped airfoils, the concept of a 'sharp' geometric singularity where flow must depart smoothly still applies.\n\n*   **C. The trailing edge of an airfoil is a stagnation point.** This statement is **FALSE**. This is a common misconception. For a *cusped* trailing edge (where the upper and lower surfaces meet tangentially), the Kutta condition indeed implies that the velocity at the trailing edge is zero, making it a stagnation point. However, for a *sharp* trailing edge with a finite angle, the Kutta condition ensures that the velocity at the trailing edge is finite and non-zero. Since the statement generalizes to 'an airfoil' (implying all airfoils), it is incorrect.\n\n*   **D. The flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly.** This statement is **TRUE**. This is the core physical premise and definition of the Kutta condition. It ensures that the streamlines from the upper and lower surfaces merge smoothly at the trailing edge, preventing turbulent eddies or infinite velocities that would otherwise be predicted by purely inviscid theory."

It states that the flow must leave the trailing edge of an airfoil smoothly, without any discontinuities or infinite velocities. This condition uniquely determines the circulation around the airfoil.",
        "**Step 2: Evaluate Statement A: 'It is utilized to determine the circulation on an airfoil.'** This is true. Potential flow theory alone yields infinite solutions for circulation; the Kutta condition provides the necessary additional constraint to determine a unique value.",
        "**Step 3: Evaluate Statement B: 'It is applicable only to airfoils with sharp trailing edge.'** This is generally considered true in the context of avoiding infinite velocities at sharp corners. While the principle of smooth flow applies more broadly, the term 'Kutta condition' is primarily associated with sharp trailing edges where it ensures finite velocity.",
        "**Step 4: Evaluate Statement C: 'The trailing edge of an airfoil is a stagnation point.'** This is not universally true. For a cusped trailing edge (zero angle), the velocity is indeed zero (stagnation point). However, for a sharp trailing edge (finite angle), the velocity is finite and non-zero. Therefore, the statement is false as a general claim.",
        "**Step 5: Evaluate Statement D: 'The flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly.'** This is the fundamental physical statement of the Kutta condition, ensuring that the upper and lower surface streamlines meet at the trailing edge without intersecting at an angle, leading to finite velocities and realistic flow.",
