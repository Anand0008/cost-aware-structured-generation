      "reasoning": "The system is a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rotational system. To find its natural frequency, we need to determine the equivalent mass moment of inertia ($I_{eq}$) and the equivalent rotational stiffness ($K_{eq}$) about the pivot point.\n\n1.  **Equivalent Mass Moment of Inertia ($I_{eq}$):**\n    The rod is massless. The mass $m$ is attached at a point that is horizontally $L$ from the pivot and vertically $H$ from the end of the horizontal segment. The distance $r$ from the pivot to the mass $m$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides $L$ and $H$. Therefore, $r = \\sqrt{L^2 + H^2}$.\n    The mass moment of inertia of a point mass $m$ about a pivot at distance $r$ is $I_{eq} = mr^2$.\n    $I_{eq} = m (\\sqrt{L^2 + H^2})^2 = m(L^2 + H^2)$.\n\n2.  **Equivalent Rotational Stiffness ($K_{eq}$):**\n    The linear spring of stiffness $k$ is attached at a horizontal distance $L/2$ from the pivot. Let the rod undergo a small angular displacement $\\theta$ from its equilibrium position. The linear deflection of the spring, $\\delta_s$, at its attachment point is $\\delta_s = (L/2) \\theta$ (using the small angle approximation).\n    The restoring force exerted by the spring is $F_s = k \\delta_s = k (L/2) \\theta$.\n    The restoring moment $M_s$ about the pivot due to this spring force is $M_s = F_s \\times (L/2)$.\n    $M_s = (k (L/2) \\theta) \\times (L/2) = k \\frac{L^2}{4} \\theta$.\n    The equivalent rotational stiffness $K_{eq}$ is the coefficient of $\\theta$ in the restoring moment equation: $K_{eq} = k \\frac{L^2}{4}$.\n\n3.  **Natural Angular Frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    For an SDOF rotational system, the natural angular frequency is $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eq}}{I_{eq}}}$.\n    Substituting the expressions for $K_{eq}$ and $I_{eq}$:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k \\frac{L^2}{4}}{m(L^2 + H^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k L^2}{4m(L^2 + H^2)}}$ (rad/s).\n\n4.  **Natural Frequency ($f_n$):**\n    The natural frequency in Hertz is $f_n = \\frac{\\omega_n}{2\\pi}$.\n    $f_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k L^2}{4m(L^2 + H^2)}}$ (Hz).\n\nThis derived formula matches option A."

        "Identify the system as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rotational system. It consists of a rigid massless rod pinned at one end (pivot), a point mass $m$ at the other end, and a linear spring of stiffness $k$ attached at the mid-span of the horizontal part. Choose a small angular displacement $\\theta$ about the pivot as the generalized coordinate.",
        "Determine the equivalent mass moment of inertia ($I_{eq}$) of the system about the pivot. Since the rod is massless, only the point mass $m$ contributes. The distance of the point mass from the pivot is $r = \\sqrt{L^2 + H^2}$. Thus, $I_{eq} = mr^2 = m(L^2 + H^2)$.",
        "Determine the equivalent rotational stiffness ($K_{eq}$) of the system about the pivot. When the rod rotates by a small angle $\\theta$, the linear spring of stiffness $k$ (located at $L/2$ from the pivot) deflects linearly by $\\delta_s = (L/2)\\theta$. The restoring force exerted by the spring is $F_s = k\\delta_s = k(L/2)\\theta$. The restoring moment ($M_s$) about the pivot due to this force is $M_s = F_s \\times (L/2) = k(L/2)\\theta \\times (L/2) = k L^2 \\theta / 4$. Therefore, the equivalent rotational stiffness is $K_{eq} = k L^2 / 4$.",
        "For an undamped free rotational vibration, the equation of motion is $I_{eq}\\ddot{\\theta} + K_{eq}\\theta = 0$.",
        "From the equation of motion, the natural angular frequency $\\omega_n$ is given by $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K_{eq} / I_{eq}}$. Substitute the derived expressions for $I_{eq}$ and $K_{eq}$: $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k L^2 / 4}{m (L^2 + H^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k L^2}{4 m (L^2 + H^2)}}$.",

        "Substitute the expression for $\\omega_n$ into the frequency conversion formula: $f_n = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k L^2}{4 m (L^2 + H^2)}}$. Compare this derived expression with the given options to identify the correct answer."

The design involves calculating natural frequencies to ensure they do not resonate with environmental or engine vibrations, thereby protecting the equipment.",

If these are clear, proceed with the derivation. If the geometry seems ambiguous, re-read the question and diagram carefully. Write inertia and rotational stiffness quickly; no numbers are given, so it is purely symbolic and algebraic.",

Aim to finish within 2 minutes: 1 minute to set up geometry and moments, 1 minute to derive \\(\\omega_n\\) and match the option.

The natural frequency can be found by equating the maximum kinetic energy and maximum potential energy of the system during vibration, or by deriving the equation of motion from Lagrange's equation: $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. This typically leads to an equation of the form $I_{eq}\\ddot{\\theta} + K_{eq}\\theta = 0$.",

Cons: Requires careful calculation of kinetic and potential energy terms, can be more algebraically involved or slightly longer for simple SDOF problems compared to direct torque balance.",
