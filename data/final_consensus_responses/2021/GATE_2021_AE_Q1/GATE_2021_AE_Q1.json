      "reasoning": "The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients: $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 8\\frac{dy}{dx} + 16y = 0$. The initial conditions are $y(0)=1$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0$.\n\n1.  **Form the characteristic equation:** Replace $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ with $r^2$, $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ with $r$, and $y$ with $1$. This gives $r^2 + 8r + 16 = 0$.\n2.  **Solve for the roots:** The characteristic equation is a perfect square: $(r+4)^2 = 0$. This yields a repeated real root $r = -4$.\n3.  **Write the general solution:** For repeated real roots $r$, the general solution is $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{rx}$. Substituting $r = -4$, we get $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{-4x}$.\n4.  **Apply the first initial condition `y(0)=1`:**\n    $1 = (C_1 + C_2 \\cdot 0)e^{-4 \\cdot 0}$\n    $1 = (C_1 + 0) \\cdot 1$\n    $C_1 = 1$.\n5.  **Find the derivative `dy/dx`:**\n    Substitute $C_1 = 1$ into the general solution: $y(x) = (1 + C_2 x)e^{-4x}$.\n    Using the product rule $\\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv'$ where $u = (1 + C_2 x)$ and $v = e^{-4x}$:\n    $u' = C_2$\n    $v' = -4e^{-4x}$\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = C_2 e^{-4x} + (1 + C_2 x)(-4e^{-4x})$\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-4x}(C_2 - 4(1 + C_2 x))$\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-4x}(C_2 - 4 - 4C_2 x)$.\n6.  **Apply the second initial condition `dy/dx(0)=0`:**\n    $0 = e^{-4 \\cdot 0}(C_2 - 4 - 4C_2 \\cdot 0)$\n    $0 = 1 \\cdot (C_2 - 4 - 0)$\n    $0 = C_2 - 4$\n    $C_2 = 4$.\n7.  **Substitute `C1` and `C2` back into the general solution:**\n    $y(x) = (1 + 4x)e^{-4x}$.\nThis matches option D."
