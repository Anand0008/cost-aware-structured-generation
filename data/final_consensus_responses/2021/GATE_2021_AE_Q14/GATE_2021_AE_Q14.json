      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify true statement(s) across an oblique shock under adiabatic conditions. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Statement A: Total pressure decreases.** Across any shock wave (normal or oblique), the flow undergoes an irreversible process. This irreversibility leads to an increase in entropy, which is always accompanied by a decrease in total (stagnation) pressure ($P_{02} < P_{01}$). This is a fundamental principle of compressible flow with shocks.\n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n2.  **Statement B: Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock decreases.** The tangential component of *velocity* ($V_t$) is conserved across an oblique shock ($V_{t1} = V_{t2}$). However, the static temperature ($T$) of the flow increases across the shock ($T_2 > T_1$). Since the speed of sound is given by $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, an increase in $T$ means an increase in $a$ ($a_2 > a_1$). The tangential Mach number is defined as $M_t = V_t / a$. As $V_t$ is constant and $a$ increases, $M_t$ must decrease ($M_{t2} < M_{t1}$). \n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n3.  **Statement C: Total temperature remains constant.** For an adiabatic flow (no heat addition or removal), the total (stagnation) enthalpy remains constant across the shock. Since total temperature is directly related to total enthalpy ($h_0 = C_p T_0$), the total temperature also remains constant across an adiabatic oblique shock ($T_{02} = T_{01}$). \n    **Verdict: TRUE.**\n\n4.  **Statement D: Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock remains the same and that based on velocity normal to the shock decreases.**\n    *   The first part, \"Mach number based on velocity tangential to the shock remains the same,\" is **FALSE**, as explained for statement B (it decreases).\n    *   The second part, \"that based on velocity normal to the shock decreases,\" is **TRUE**, as the normal component of Mach number changes from supersonic ($M_{n1} > 1$) to subsonic ($M_{n2} < 1$) across the shock.\n    Since the first part of the statement is false, the entire statement D is considered **FALSE**.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A, B, and C are true."

        "**Step 1: Understand Oblique Shock Fundamentals and Geometry.** The problem describes supersonic flow over a wedge, which generates an attached oblique shock wave. Recall the basic properties of flow across an oblique shock, specifically how velocity components and thermodynamic properties change. An oblique shock is an irreversible process occurring in adiabatic conditions. Analysis is typically done by resolving flow properties into normal and tangential components relative to the shock wave.",
        "Recognize that the tangential component of velocity ($V_t$ or $w$) is conserved across an oblique shock ($V_{t1} = V_{t2}$). The normal component of velocity behaves like a normal shock. The static temperature ($T$) increases across the shock ($T_2 > T_1$). Since the speed of sound ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$) is proportional to $\\sqrt{T}$, an increase in $T$ means an increase in $a$ ($a_2 > a_1$). The tangential Mach number is defined as $M_t = V_t / a$. With $V_t$ constant and $a$ increasing, $M_t$ must decrease.",
        "Analyze Normal Velocity and Mach Number. The normal component of Mach number ($M_n$) transitions from supersonic ($M_{n1} > 1$) to subsonic ($M_{n2} < 1$) across the shock, similar to a normal shock. Thus, $M_n$ decreases.",
        "Analyze Total Pressure. Understand that any shock wave is an irreversible process, leading to an increase in entropy. This increase in entropy is always accompanied by a decrease in total (stagnation) pressure ($P_{02} < P_{01}$). This makes statement A TRUE.",

Since total temperature is directly related to total enthalpy ($h_0 = C_p T_0$), the total temperature also remains constant across an adiabatic oblique shock ($T_{02} = T_{01}$).
