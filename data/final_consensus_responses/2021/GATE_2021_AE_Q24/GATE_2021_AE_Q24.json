The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust ($N_{thrust}$):**\n    With the right engine non-functional, the left engine produces thrust. The lateral distance from the aircraft's centerline to the engine ($y_{engine}$) is half the spanwise distance between the two engines.\n    $y_{engine} = \\frac{10\\text{ m}}{2} = 5\\text{ m}$\n    $N_{thrust} = T \\times y_{engine} = 8000\\text{ N} \\times 5\\text{ m} = 40000\\text{ N m}$\n    (This moment tends to yaw the aircraft nose to the right, conventionally a positive yawing moment).\n\n2.  **Calculate the dynamic pressure ($q$):**\n    $q = 0.5 \\times \\rho \\times V^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225\\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (100\\text{ m/s})^2 = 0.5 \\times 1.225 \\times 10000 = 6125\\text{ N/m}^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the yawing moment equilibrium equation:**\n    To maintain zero sideslip, the net yawing moment must be zero.

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle: To maintain zero sideslip after an engine failure, the yawing moment from the asymmetric thrust must be balanced by the yawing moment generated by the rudder. Also, identify the given parameters for the aircraft, engine thrust, dimensions, flight conditions, and rudder effectiveness.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust ($N_{thrust}$). With one engine failed, the operating engine thrust $T = 8000$ N acts at a lateral distance from the aircraft centerline. Given the spanwise distance between engines is 10 m, the moment arm $y_{engine} = 10 / 2 = 5$ m. Thus, $N_{thrust} = T \\times y_{engine} = 8000 \\times 5 = 40000$ N\\u00b7m.",
        "Step 3: Define the yawing moment due to rudder deflection ($N_{rudder}$) and calculate the dynamic pressure ($q$). The rudder moment is given by $N_{rudder} = C_{n_{\\delta_r}} \\cdot \\delta_r \\cdot q \\cdot S \\cdot b$. First, calculate the dynamic pressure: $q = 0.5 \\cdot \\rho \\cdot V^2 = 0.5 \\cdot 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\cdot (100 \\text{ m/s})^2 = 6125 \\text{ N/m}^2$ (Pa).",
        "Step 4: Calculate the product $qSb$ and set up the yawing moment equilibrium equation. $qSb = 6125 \\text{ N/m}^2 \\times 50 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 10 \\text{ m} = 3.0625 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}$. For equilibrium, $N_{thrust} + N_{rudder} = 0$. Substituting the expressions: $N_{thrust} + C_{n_{\\delta_r}} \\cdot \\delta_r \\cdot q \\cdot S \\cdot b = 0$. Substituting known values: $40000 + (-0.002/\\text{deg}) \\cdot \\delta_r \\cdot (3.0625 \\times 10^6) = 0$. This simplifies to $40000 - 6125 \\cdot \\delta_r = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Solve for the rudder deflection $\\delta_r$: From the equilibrium equation, $6125 \\cdot \\delta_r = 40000$. Therefore, $\\delta_r = 40000 / 6125 \\approx 6.530612...$ degrees.",
        "Step 6: Round the final answer to two decimal places. $\\delta_r \\approx 6.53$ degrees.",
        "Step 7: The calculated rudder deflection is approximately $6.53$ degrees. This value is within typical acceptable ranges for such problems."
