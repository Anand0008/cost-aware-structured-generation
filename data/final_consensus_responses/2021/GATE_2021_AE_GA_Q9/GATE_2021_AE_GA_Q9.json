The area of the square is $A_{square} = a^2$.\n\n2.  **Identify Circular Sectors:** The shaded portion is formed by the intersection of two circular sectors:\n    *   **Sector 1 (centered at S):** This is a quarter circle with radius $a$ (arc PR). Its area is $A_{sector\\_S} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$.\n    *   **Sector 2 (centered at Q):** This is also a quarter circle with radius $a$ (arc PR). Its area is $A_{sector\\_Q} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Shaded Area ($A_{shaded}$):** The shaded area is the intersection of these two sectors. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for areas:\n    $A_{shaded} = A_{sector\\_S} + A_{sector\\_Q} - A_{square}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values:**\n    $A_{shaded} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\pi a^2 - a^2$\n    $A_{shaded} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi a^2 - a^2$\n    $A_{shaded} = a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Probability:** The probability $P$ is the ratio of the shaded area to the square's area:\n    $P = \\frac{A_{shaded}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{a^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1 \\right)}{a^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$.\n\nThis result matches option C."

        "description": "The intersection area (lens) can be viewed as two equal circular segments. Each segment's area is calculated as the area of a circular sector minus the area of a triangle. For a circle centered at S, the sector angle is $90^\\circ$ ($\\pi/2$ rad) with radius $a$, so sector area = $(1/4)\\pi a^2$. The corresponding triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs $a$, so its area = $a^2/2$. Thus, one segment area = $\\pi a^2/4 - a^2/2$. The total lens area is twice this, resulting in $(\\pi/2 - 1)a^2$.",
        "name": "Geometry via Circular Segments",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Simple, visual, and avoids the complex arccos formula. Uses only basic circle-sector and triangle areas. Cons: Requires recognizing that the intersection forms two symmetric circular segments and careful application of geometric formulas.",
        "when_to_use": "This is a preferred method if one can quickly identify the circular segments. It's useful when more comfortable with sector and triangle geometry than with the general circle-intersection formula, offering a quick and elegant solution."
