      "reasoning": "The function $f(x) = e^{-x} |\\cos x|$ needs to be analyzed for continuity and differentiability at specific points. The critical points for differentiability of functions involving absolute values are where the argument of the absolute value becomes zero. In this case, $|\\cos x|$ changes its definition where $\\cos x = 0$, i.e., at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$. \n\n**1. Continuity Check:**\nBoth $e^{-x}$ and $|\\cos x|$ are continuous functions for all $x > 0$. The product of two continuous functions is always continuous. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous for all $x > 0$. This immediately confirms that Option D (Continuous at $x = 2\\pi$) is true, as $2\\pi$ is a point where $\\cos x = 1 \\neq 0$, and thus $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$ in a neighborhood of $2\\pi$, which is clearly continuous.\n\n**2. Differentiability Check:**\nA function $f(x)$ is differentiable at a point $x_0$ if the left-hand derivative (LHD) and right-hand derivative (RHD) exist and are equal at $x_0$. The derivative of $f(x) = e^{-x} |\\cos x|$ can be found using the product rule, but special care must be taken at points where $|\\cos x|$ changes its definition (i.e., where $\\cos x = 0$).\nLet $g(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$. Then $g'(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x - e^{-x} \\sin x = -e^{-x}(\\cos x + \\sin x)$.\n\n*   **Option A: Differentiable at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?**\n    At $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, so $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = e^{-\\pi/2} |0| = 0$.\n    For $x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (but $x > 0$), $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    For $x > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (but $x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    LHD at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}^-) = g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = -e^{-\\pi/2}$.\n    RHD at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}^+) = -g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -(-e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}))) = e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = e^{-\\pi/2}$.\n    Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD ($-e^{-\\pi/2} \\neq e^{-\\pi/2}$), $f(x)$ is NOT differentiable at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So, Option A is false.\n\n*   **Option B: Differentiable at $x = \\pi$?**\n    At $x = \\pi$, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1 \\neq 0$. In a neighborhood of $x = \\pi$, $\\cos x$ is negative. Therefore, $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$ for $x$ near $\\pi$. Since $-e^{-x} \\cos x$ is a product of elementary differentiable functions, $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = \\pi$. So, Option B is true.\n\n*   **Option C: Differentiable at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$?**\n    At $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0$, so $f(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = e^{-3\\pi/2} |0| = 0$.\n    For $x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ (but $x > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    For $x > \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ (but $x < \\frac{5\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$.\n    LHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^-) = -g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -(-e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}))) = e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}$.\n    RHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$: $f'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^+) = g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) + \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = e^{-3\\pi/2}$.\n    Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD ($-e^{-3\\pi/2} \\neq e^{-3\\pi/2}$), $f(x)$ is NOT differentiable at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. So, Option C is false.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are B and D."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the function definition $f(x) = e^{-x} |\\cos x|$ for $x > 0$. Identify that the exponential $e^{-x}$ is smooth, while the absolute value term $|\\cos x|$ is the critical part that might affect differentiability, specifically where $\\cos x = 0$.",
        "Step 2: Determine the points where $|\\cos x|$ changes its definition, which occurs when $\\cos x = 0$. For $x > 0$, these points are $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$. These are the points where differentiability needs careful checking using left-hand and right-hand derivatives.",
        "Step 3: Check continuity. Recall that $e^{-x}$ is continuous for all $x$, and $|\\cos x|$ is continuous for all $x$. The product of continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous for all $x > 0$. This confirms Option D (Continuous at $x = 2\\pi$) is true.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate differentiability at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (Option A). Define $g(x) = e^{-x} \\cos x$, with derivative $g'(x) = -e^{-x}(\\cos x + \\sin x)$. For $x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = g(x)$. The Left-Hand Derivative (LHD) at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\pi/2) + \\sin(\\pi/2)) = -e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = -e^{-\\pi/2}$. For $x > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -g(x)$. The Right-Hand Derivative (RHD) at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $-g'(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = e^{-\\pi/2}(\\cos(\\pi/2) + \\sin(\\pi/2)) = e^{-\\pi/2}(0 + 1) = e^{-\\pi/2}$. Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD, $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. (Option A is false).",
        "Step 5: Evaluate differentiability at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ (Option C). Similar to Step 4: For $x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos x < 0$, so $f(x) = -g(x)$. LHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ is $-g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(3\\pi/2) + \\sin(3\\pi/2)) = e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}$. For $x > \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos x > 0$, so $f(x) = g(x)$. RHD at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ is $g'(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(\\cos(3\\pi/2) + \\sin(3\\pi/2)) = -e^{-3\\pi/2}(0 - 1) = e^{-3\\pi/2}$. Since LHD $\\neq$ RHD, $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. (Option C is false).",
        "Step 6: Evaluate differentiability at $x = \\pi$ (Option B). At $x = \\pi$, $\\cos \\pi = -1 \\neq 0$. In a neighborhood of $x = \\pi$, $\\cos x$ is strictly negative, so $f(x) = -e^{-x} \\cos x$. Since this form is a product of differentiable functions ($e^{-x}$ and $\\cos x$), the function is differentiable at $x = \\pi$. (Option B is true).",
