  "question_text": "A large water tank is fixed on a cart with wheels and a vane (see figure). The wheels of the cart provide negligible resistance for rolling on the fixed support. The cart is tied to the fixed support with a thin horizontal rope. There is a hole of diameter 5 cm on the side of the tank through which a jet of constant velocity of 10 m/s emerges. The jet of water is deflected by the attached vane by 60° (see figure). Assume that the jet velocity remains constant at 10 m/s after emerging from the vane. Take density of water to be 1000 kg/m³. The tension in the connecting rope is _____ N (round off to one decimal place).",

      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the tension in a rope that holds a cart stationary against the force exerted by a deflected water jet. This requires applying the linear momentum equation to a control volume encompassing the jet and the vane. The force exerted by the fluid on the vane in the horizontal direction must be balanced by the rope tension.\n\n1.  **Calculate the cross-sectional area of the jet:**\n    The diameter $D = 5$ cm $= 0.05$ m.\n    $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.05 \\text{ m})^2}{4} = 0.001963495 \\text{ m}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mass flow rate of the water jet:**\n    Density $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$.\n    Jet velocity $V = 10$ m/s.\n    $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.001963495 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 10 \\text{ m/s} = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s}$\n\n3.  **Determine the initial and final horizontal velocity components of the jet:**\n    The jet emerges horizontally, so the initial horizontal velocity component is $V_{in,x} = 10$ m/s.\n    The jet is deflected by $60^\\circ$ from the horizontal, and its magnitude remains $10$ m/s. So, the final horizontal velocity component is:\n    $V_{out,x} = V \\cos(60^\\circ) = 10 \\times 0.5 = 5$ m/s\n\n4.  **Apply the linear momentum equation in the x-direction to find the force exerted by the fluid on the vane ($F_x$):**\n    The force exerted by the fluid on the vane in the x-direction is given by:\n    $F_x = \\dot{m}(V_{in,x} - V_{out,x})$\n    $F_x = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s} \\times (10 \\text{ m/s} - 5 \\text{ m/s})$\n    $F_x = 19.63495 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 5 \\text{ m/s} = 98.17475 \\text{ N}$\n\n5.  **Determine the tension in the rope:**\n    Since the cart is stationary, the net horizontal force on the cart-vane system must be zero. The force $F_x$ acts to the right (positive x-direction). The tension in the rope ($T$) acts to the left, balancing this force.\n    $T = F_x = 98.17475 \\text{ N}$\n\n6.  **Round off to one decimal place:**\n    $T \\approx 98.2 \\text{ N}$\n\nThis value falls within the specified range of 98.0 to 98.5 N."

        "Step 1: Understand the problem and define the control volume. Identify the given information: water jet velocity (V = 10 m/s), hole diameter (D = 5 cm = 0.05 m), deflection angle (θ = 60°), and water density (ρ = 1000 kg/m³). Define the control volume as the region encompassing the water jet from the exit of the hole to the exit of the vane. Recognize that the cart is held in place by the rope, and the rope tension must balance the horizontal force exerted by the jet on the vane-cart system.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the cross-sectional area of the water jet. A = π * D² / 4 = π * (0.05 m)² / 4 = 0.0019635 m².",
        "Step 3: Calculate the mass flow rate of the water jet. ṁ = ρ * A * V = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.0019635 m² * 10 m/s = 19.635 kg/s.",
        "Step 4: Determine the initial and final horizontal components of the jet velocity. The initial horizontal velocity (V_in,x) is V = 10 m/s. The final horizontal velocity (V_out,x) after deflection is V * cos(θ) = 10 m/s * cos(60°) = 10 * 0.5 = 5 m/s.",
        "Step 5: Apply the linear momentum equation in the horizontal direction. The horizontal force exerted by the fluid on the vane (F_x) is given by F_x = ṁ * (V_in,x - V_out,x). Substitute the values: F_x = 19.635 kg/s * (10 m/s - 5 m/s) = 19.635 * 5 N = 98.175 N.",
        "Step 6: Equate the rope tension to this force and state the final answer. Since the cart is stationary, the tension (T) in the rope must be equal to the horizontal force exerted by the fluid on the vane. T = F_x = 98.175 N. Rounding to one decimal place, the tension T = 98.2 N."
