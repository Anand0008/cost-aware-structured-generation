      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the operating modes of Nozzles A and B based on the wave patterns shown at their exits. According to the principles of compressible flow through nozzles:\n\n1.  **Nozzle A**: The image clearly shows **oblique shock waves** forming at the nozzle exit and turning the flow inwards. Oblique shock waves occur when a supersonic flow encounters a region of higher pressure, causing compression. This implies that the static pressure at the nozzle exit ($P_e$) is *lower* than the ambient (back) pressure ($P_{ambient}$), i.e., $P_e < P_{ambient}$. This condition is defined as an **over-expanded nozzle**.\n\n2.  **Nozzle B**: The image clearly shows **expansion fans (Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves)** forming at the nozzle exit and turning the flow outwards. Expansion waves occur when a supersonic flow encounters a region of lower pressure, causing further expansion. This implies that the static pressure at the nozzle exit ($P_e$) is *higher* than the ambient (back) pressure ($P_{ambient}$), i.e., $P_e > P_{ambient}$. This condition is defined as an **under-expanded nozzle**.\n\nTherefore, Nozzle A is operating in an over-expanded mode, and Nozzle B is operating in an under-expanded mode. Option A correctly states 'over-expanded mode and under-expanded mode' respectively."
