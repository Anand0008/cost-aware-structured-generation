      "reasoning": "The integral can be solved using Cauchy's Integral Formula. First, identify the singularity (pole) by setting the denominator to zero: $4z - i = 0 \\implies z_0 = i/4$. Next, check if this pole lies inside the contour $\\zeta$, which is the unit circle $|z|=1$. The modulus of the pole is $|i/4| = 1/4$. Since $1/4 < 1$, the pole lies inside the contour. Rewrite the integrand to match Cauchy's Integral Formula form $\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz = 2\\pi i f(a)$. The given integrand is $\\frac{z^3}{4z - i} = \\frac{z^3}{4(z - i/4)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{z^3}{z - i/4}$. Here, $f(z) = z^3$ and $a = i/4$. Applying the formula, the integral becomes $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2\\pi i \\times f(i/4)$. Calculate $f(i/4) = (i/4)^3 = i^3/64 = -i/64$. Substitute this back: $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2\\pi i \\times (-i/64) = \\frac{2\\pi i (-i)}{256} = \\frac{2\\pi (-i^2)}{256} = \\frac{2\\pi (1)}{256} = \\frac{\\pi}{128}$. Numerically, $\\frac{\\pi}{128} \\approx 0.02454369$. Rounding to three decimal places gives $0.025$."
