      "reasoning": "The problem involves determining the orientation of the plane of maximum shear stress for a given 2D plane stress state. First, the stress components σ_x, σ_y, and τ_xy must be correctly identified from the provided figure, paying close attention to sign conventions.\n\nFrom the figure:\n*   Normal stress in x-direction, σ_x: The arrows on the left and right faces point inwards, indicating compression. So, σ_x = -80 MPa.\n*   Normal stress in y-direction, σ_y: The arrows on the top and bottom faces point inwards, indicating compression. So, σ_y = -20 MPa.\n*   Shear stress, τ_xy: On the positive x-face (right face), the shear stress arrow points downwards (negative y-direction). On the positive y-face (top face), the shear stress arrow points left (negative x-direction). According to the standard sign convention (positive τ_xy causes counter-clockwise rotation), this configuration indicates a negative shear stress. So, τ_xy = -30 MPa.\n\nThe formula for the orientation of the planes of maximum shear stress (θ_S) is given by:\ntan(2θ_S) = - (σ_x - σ_y) / (2τ_xy)\n\nSubstitute the identified stress values into the formula:\ntan(2θ_S) = - ((-80) - (-20)) / (2 * (-30))\ntan(2θ_S) = - (-80 + 20) / (-60)\ntan(2θ_S) = - (-60) / (-60)\ntan(2θ_S) = -1\n\nNow, solve for θ_S:\n2θ_S = arctan(-1)\nThe principal value for arctan(-1) is -45°.\nTherefore, θ_S = -45° / 2 = -22.5°.\n\nThe other plane of maximum shear stress is -22.5° + 90° = 67.5°.\nThe orientation of the plane with maximum shear stress with respect to the x-axis is -22.5°."

The angle $2\\theta_S$ is 90 degrees from $2\\theta_P$ on the circle, corresponding to the top and bottom points of the circle (where shear stress is maximum).",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides a visual understanding and intuition of the stress state, less prone to sign errors if drawn correctly, and can simultaneously provide principal stresses, maximum shear stress, and normal stress on maximum shear planes. Cons: Can be less precise for exact angles without careful drawing or analytical calculation from the circle's geometry, and is generally more time-consuming than direct formula application, especially for complex stress states or when only a single value is needed.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for conceptual understanding, verifying analytical results, or when the problem asks for multiple stress transformation values (e.g., principal stresses, maximum shear, normal stress on maximum shear planes), or for qualitative understanding."
