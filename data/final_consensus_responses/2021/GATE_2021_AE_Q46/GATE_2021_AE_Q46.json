        "Step 1: Understand the fundamental vector relationship for turbomachinery velocity triangles: Absolute velocity (V) = Blade speed (U) + Relative velocity (W). The blade speed U is purely tangential.",
        "Step 2: Identify the given data at the rotor exit: relative flow angle (blade angle) $\\beta_2 = 30^\\circ$, absolute velocity magnitude $V_2 = 240 \\text{ m/s}$, and relative velocity magnitude $W_2 = 140 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 3: Resolve the relative velocity $W_2$ into its axial and tangential components.\n    *   Axial component: $W_{2a} = W_2 \\cos \\beta_2 = 140 \\cos 30^\\circ = 140 \\times (\\sqrt{3}/2) \\approx 121.24 \\text{ m/s}$.\n    *   Tangential component: $W_{2\\theta} = -W_2 \\sin \\beta_2 = -140 \\sin 30^\\circ = -70 \\text{ m/s}$. (The negative sign indicates that the tangential component of relative velocity opposes the blade speed U for a compressor, based on standard conventions).",
        "Step 4: Apply the vector addition for the absolute velocity $V_2$ components. Since the blade speed U has no axial component, the axial component of $V_2$ is equal to the axial component of $W_2$: $V_{2a} = W_{2a} = 121.24 \\text{ m/s}$. The tangential component of $V_2$ is $V_{2\\theta} = U + W_{2\\theta} = U - 70$.",
        "Step 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem for the magnitude of the absolute velocity: $V_2^2 = V_{2a}^2 + V_{2\\theta}^2$. Substitute the known values: $240^2 = (121.24)^2 + (U - 70)^2$.",
        "Step 6: Solve the equation for U:\n    *   $57600 = 14700 + (U - 70)^2$\n    *   $(U - 70)^2 = 57600 - 14700 = 42900$\n    *   $U - 70 = \\sqrt{42900} \\approx 207.12$ (taking the positive root as U must be positive and greater than 70).\n    *   $U = 70 + 207.12 = 277.12 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 7: The calculated blade speed is approximately $277.12 \\text{ m/s}$. This value is within the acceptable range of $274-282 \\text{ m/s}$."

For compressor, φ = 90° + β2 (if β2 is positive and measured from axial opposite to U). Then cos φ = cos(90°+β2) = -sin β2, leading to the same equation.",
