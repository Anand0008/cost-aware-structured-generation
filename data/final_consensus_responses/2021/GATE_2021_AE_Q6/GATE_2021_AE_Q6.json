      "reasoning": "For a turbojet engine operating at a given flight speed ($V_0$), an increase in flight altitude leads to several interacting effects. As altitude increases, ambient static pressure ($P_0$) and temperature ($T_0$) decrease, resulting in lower air density ($\\rho_0$). While this decrease in $\\rho_0$ reduces the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) through the engine, causing the *absolute thrust* ($F$) to decrease, the *specific thrust* ($F_s = F/\\dot{m}_a$) behaves differently.\nThe decrease in ambient pressure ($P_0$) at higher altitudes significantly increases the overall pressure ratio across the nozzle ($P_{t5}/P_0$). This allows the exhaust gases to expand to a greater extent, resulting in a higher exhaust velocity ($V_e$). Additionally, for a constant flight speed, the flight Mach number ($M_0 = V_0/a_0$) increases with altitude because the speed of sound ($a_0$) decreases with lower ambient temperature. This increased Mach number can lead to improved ram pressure recovery at the inlet.\nThe specific thrust is approximately given by $F_s \\approx (1+f)V_e - V_0$. The dominant effect of increasing altitude on specific thrust is the significant increase in exhaust velocity ($V_e$) due to the more favorable nozzle expansion ratio. Therefore, despite the reduction in air mass flow, the engine becomes more efficient at accelerating the available air, leading to an increase in specific thrust. Thus, specific thrust increases monotonically with altitude for a given flight speed."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define Specific Thrust. Specific thrust ($F_s$) for a turbojet engine is defined as the thrust ($F$) produced per unit mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$), i.e., $F_s = F / \\dot{m}_a$.",
        "Step 2: Apply Momentum Equation. From the momentum equation, specific thrust can be approximated as $F_s \\approx (1+f)V_e - V_0$, where $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity, $V_0$ is the flight velocity, and $f$ is the fuel-air ratio. The question specifies that flight speed ($V_0$) is constant.",
        "Step 3: Analyze Altitude Effects on Ambient Conditions. As flight altitude increases, the ambient static pressure ($P_0$) and ambient temperature ($T_0$) decrease. Consequently, air density ($\rho_0$) and the speed of sound ($a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$) also decrease.",
        "Step 4: Determine Effect on Exhaust Velocity ($V_e$). The exhaust velocity is primarily governed by the pressure ratio across the nozzle ($P_{t5}/P_0$). With increasing altitude, the significant decrease in ambient static pressure ($P_0$) leads to a higher nozzle pressure ratio. This allows for greater expansion of the exhaust gases, resulting in an increased exhaust velocity ($V_e$). While the decrease in $T_0$ might affect $T_{t5}$, the dominant effect is the increased pressure ratio.",
        "Step 5: Consider Non-Dimensional Performance (Alternative/Reinforcement). For a fixed flight Mach number and turbine inlet temperature, the non-dimensional thrust parameter ($F/(\\dot{m}_a a_0)$) is approximately constant. Since the ambient speed of sound ($a_0$) decreases with increasing altitude, for the non-dimensional thrust to remain constant, the specific thrust ($F/\\dot{m}_a$) must increase.",
        "Step 6: Conclude Specific Thrust Trend. As $V_e$ increases with altitude (due to the dominant effect of decreasing $P_0$) and $V_0$ remains constant, the specific thrust ($F_s = (1+f)V_e - V_0$) will increase monotonically with increasing flight altitude."

If you recall the general trend (specific thrust increases with altitude for a given flight speed), answer quickly. If unsure, quickly recall the definition of specific thrust and how exhaust velocity changes with ambient pressure. Use elimination: absolute thrust decreases, constant is unlikely, and first increasing then decreasing is not typical for turbojets in the troposphere.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, eliminate options suggesting constant behavior, as engine parameters rarely remain perfectly constant with altitude. Recall that for turbojets, altitude generally improves efficiency parameters (specific thrust increases, TSFC decreases) up to a point, making a monotonic increase plausible. Consider the primary effect of altitude on pressure and its impact on exhaust velocity, and remember that specific thrust often increases with altitude for a given flight speed.",
      "time_management": "Aim to solve this conceptual question within 1-2 minutes. It's a quick recall/application question; if the trend isn't immediately clear, make an educated guess based on elimination and move on to avoid a time sink, especially considering negative marking."
