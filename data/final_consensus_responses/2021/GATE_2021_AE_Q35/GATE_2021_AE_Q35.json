      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify true statements. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Service ceiling is higher than absolute ceiling for a piston-propeller aircraft.**\n*   **Analysis:** The absolute ceiling is defined as the altitude where the maximum rate of climb (RoC) is 0 ft/min. The service ceiling is defined as the altitude where the maximum RoC is a small specified value (e.g., 100 ft/min for jets, or 50 ft/min for piston-propeller aircraft). Since an aircraft can still climb at the service ceiling but cannot climb at all at the absolute ceiling, the absolute ceiling is always *higher* than the service ceiling. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\n**B. For a given aircraft, the stall speed increases with increase in altitude.**\n*   **Analysis:** Stall speed ($V_s$) in true airspeed is given by the formula $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L_{max}}}}$. Here, $W$ is the aircraft weight, $S$ is the wing area, $\\rho$ is the air density, and $C_{L_{max}}$ is the maximum lift coefficient. As altitude increases, the air density ($\\rho$) decreases. Since $V_s$ is inversely proportional to the square root of density ($\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}$), a decrease in density will lead to an increase in stall speed, assuming $W$, $S$, and $C_{L_{max}}$ remain constant. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n**C. Everything else remaining the same, a tailwind increases the range of an aircraft.**\n*   **Analysis:** Range is the total ground distance an aircraft can cover. A tailwind is wind blowing in the same direction as the aircraft's flight path. If an aircraft maintains a constant airspeed (and thus a constant fuel consumption rate for a given flight condition), a tailwind effectively increases its ground speed ($V_g = V_{air} + V_{wind}$). With a higher ground speed, the aircraft covers more ground distance for the same amount of fuel consumed, thus increasing its range. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n**D. For a jet aircraft constrained to fly at constant altitude, there exists an altitude where its range is maximum.**\n*   **Analysis:** For a jet aircraft, range is generally given by the Breguet range equation, which involves factors like lift-to-drag ratio ($\\frac{L}{D}$), true airspeed ($V$), and thrust specific fuel consumption ($c_t$). As altitude increases, the optimal true airspeed for maximum range increases (due to lower density), and the thrust specific fuel consumption ($c_t$) of jet engines generally decreases (improving engine efficiency) up to a certain altitude. These factors combine to create an optimum altitude where the overall range is maximized. Beyond this optimum, the decreasing available thrust or other factors might reduce range. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements B, C, and D are true."

        "Step 1: Analyze Statement A by recalling the definitions of service ceiling and absolute ceiling. Absolute ceiling is the altitude where the maximum rate of climb (RoC) is 0 ft/min, while service ceiling is where RoC is a specified minimum value (e.g., 100 ft/min). Conclude that absolute ceiling is always higher than service ceiling, making statement A false.",
        "Step 2: Analyze Statement B by recalling the stall speed formula $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_{L_{max}}}}$. Recognize that air density ($\\rho$) decreases with increasing altitude. Since stall speed is inversely proportional to the square root of density, a decrease in density leads to an increase in stall speed. Conclude that statement B is true.",
        "Analyze Option C: Tailwind and Range. Range is the ground distance covered. A tailwind increases the aircraft's ground speed (V_g) for a given airspeed (V_air). Since fuel consumption is primarily related to airspeed, a higher ground speed means more ground distance covered per unit of fuel, thus increasing the aircraft's range.",
        "Analyze Option D: Maximum range altitude for a jet aircraft. For jet aircraft, range is influenced by altitude-dependent factors such as true airspeed, thrust specific fuel consumption, air density, and drag. The interplay of these factors, particularly the balance between power required and power available, leads to an optimum altitude where specific range (distance per unit fuel) is maximized, thereby maximizing the aircraft's overall range.",
