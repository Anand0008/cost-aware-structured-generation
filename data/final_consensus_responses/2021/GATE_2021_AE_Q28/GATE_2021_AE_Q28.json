      "reasoning": "The problem requires ensuring dynamic similarity by matching inertial and viscous forces, which translates to matching the Reynolds number (Re) between the prototype (aircraft) and the model (wind tunnel). The Reynolds number is given by $Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}$.\n\nGiven conditions:\n1.  Prototype velocity, $V_p = 100$ km/h\n2.  Scale model, $L_m = \\frac{L_p}{5}$\n3.  Wind tunnel pressure, $p_m = 10 \\times p_p$\n4.  Same temperature, $T_m = T_p$\n5.  Ideal gas law holds: $p = \\rho R T$\n6.  Matching inertial and viscous forces implies $Re_p = Re_m$.\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Reynolds Number Similarity:**\n    $\\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m}$\n\n2.  **Viscosity relationship:** For ideal gases, viscosity ($\\mu$) is primarily a function of temperature. Since $T_m = T_p$, it implies that the viscosity of the fluid in the model test is the same as in the prototype flight, i.e., $\\mu_m = \\mu_p$.\n    Therefore, the Reynolds number similarity simplifies to:\n    $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$\n\n3.  **Density ratio from Ideal Gas Law:**\n    Since $p = \\rho R T$, the density $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$.\n    The ratio of densities is $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m / (R T_m)}{p_p / (R T_p)}$.\n    Given $T_m = T_p$ and assuming the same gas (or at least the same gas constant $R$), the $R$ and $T$ terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m}{p_p}$\n    Substitute $p_m = 10 \\times p_p$:\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{10 \\times p_p}{p_p} = 10$\n    So, $\\rho_m = 10 \\times \\rho_p$.\n\n4.  **Substitute ratios into simplified Reynolds number equation:**\n    $\\rho_p V_p L_p = (10 \\rho_p) V_m (\\frac{L_p}{5})$\n    Cancel out $\\rho_p$ and $L_p$ from both sides:\n    $V_p = 10 \\times V_m \\times \\frac{1}{5}$\n    $V_p = 2 \\times V_m$\n\n5.  **Solve for $V_m$:**\n    $V_m = \\frac{V_p}{2}$\n    $V_m = \\frac{100 \\text{ km/h}}{2} = 50 \\text{ km/h}$\n\nThus, the velocity needed in the wind tunnel test-section is 50 km/h."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the similarity parameter. The problem states 'similarity of inertial and viscous forces', which means we must match the Reynolds number (Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}), as it represents the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.\nStep 2: Write down the Reynolds number similarity condition: $Re_p = Re_m \\implies \\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m}$.\nStep 3: Determine the relationship for viscosity. Since the temperature is the same for the model and prototype ($T_m = T_p$), and for ideal gases, viscosity is primarily a function of temperature, we can assume $\\mu_m = \\mu_p$. This simplifies the Reynolds number equation to $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$.\nStep 4: Determine the relationship for density using the ideal gas law. Given $p = \\rho R T$ and $T_m = T_p$, the density ratio is $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{p_m}{p_p}$.\nStep 5: Substitute the given pressure ratio ($p_m = 10 p_p$) into the density ratio: $\\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{10 p_p}{p_p} = 10$. Thus, $\\rho_m = 10 \\rho_p$.\nStep 6: Substitute the density ratio and the length scale ratio ($L_m = L_p/5$) into the simplified Reynolds number equation: $\\rho_p V_p L_p = (10 \\rho_p) V_m (\\frac{L_p}{5})$.\nStep 7: Solve for the model velocity ($V_m$):\n$V_p = 10 V_m \\times \\frac{1}{5}$\n$V_p = 2 V_m$\n$V_m = \\frac{V_p}{2}$\nStep 8: Substitute the prototype velocity ($V_p = 100$ km/h):\n$V_m = \\frac{100 \\text{ km/h}}{2} = 50 \\text{ km/h}$.\nThe velocity needed in the wind tunnel test-section is 50 km/h.",
        "Step 2: Write the Reynolds number equality for prototype (aircraft) and model (wind tunnel): $Re_p = Re_m$, which means $\\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m}$.",
        "Step 3: Apply the given conditions. Since the temperature is the same ($T_m = T_p$), the viscosity is also the same ($\\mu_m = \\mu_p$) for an ideal gas. The model scale is $L_m = L_p/5$, which implies $L_p/L_m = 5$. The wind tunnel pressure is 10 times atmospheric ($p_m = 10 p_p$). Using the ideal gas law ($p = \\rho R T$) and constant temperature, the density is proportional to pressure, so $\\rho_m/\\rho_p = p_m/p_p = 10$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute these ratios into the Reynolds number equality: $\\rho_p V_p L_p = \\rho_m V_m L_m$. Rearrange to solve for $V_m$: $V_m = V_p \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_m} \\right)$. Since $\\mu_p = \\mu_m$, this simplifies to $V_m = V_p \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right)$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the derived ratios into the simplified equation: $\\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} = \\frac{1}{10}$ and $\\frac{L_p}{L_m} = 5$. So, $V_m = V_p \\times \\frac{1}{10} \\times 5$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the model velocity. Given $V_p = 100 \\text{ km/h}$, we have $V_m = 100 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{5}{10} = 100 \\text{ km/h} \\times 0.5 = 50 \\text{ km/h}$.",
        "Step 7: The required velocity in the wind tunnel for dynamic similarity is 50 km/h."
