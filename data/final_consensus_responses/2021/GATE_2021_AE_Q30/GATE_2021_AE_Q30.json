In this inverted configuration, the pilot experiences a negative g-force, meaning the load factor 'n' is negative. For the aircraft to maintain the curved path, the total downward force (Lift + Weight) provides the centripetal acceleration. For a typical steady loop, the magnitude of the downward lift force is less than the weight, resulting in a load factor 'n' such that -1 < n < 0. This condition is correctly represented by n > -1.",

        "Apply Newton's second law in the radial direction. The net force towards the center of curvature (downward) provides the centripetal force. Both weight (W) and the magnitude of lift (|L|) act downward. Therefore, the force balance is W + |L| = m V^2 / R.",
        "Define the load factor n as the ratio of lift to weight, n = L/W, where L is conventionally positive for upward lift. Since lift is downward in this inverted maneuver, L is a negative value, and thus n will be negative.",
        "Substitute L = nW into the force balance equation. Since L is negative (downward), the magnitude of lift |L| = -nW (as n is negative, -nW is positive). The force balance becomes W - nW = m V^2 / R. This can be rewritten as W(1 - n) = (W/g) V^2 / R.",

For a conventional aircraft in a steady inverted loop, the downward lift magnitude |L| is typically less than the aircraft's weight W to avoid excessive negative g-forces and structural limits. If |L| < W, then |n| < 1. Since n is negative, this means -1 < n < 0. Therefore, the load factor n must be greater than -1.",

Pilots must manage these load factors to maintain control and prevent structural overstress.",
        "why_it_matters": "Understanding load factor is critical for the structural design of aerobatic aircraft, pilot training for safe execution of extreme maneuvers, and preventing structural failure (e.g., wing spars in reverse bending) or pilot disorientation/physiological issues like redout."

Fly-by-wire fighter jets like the F-16 use flight control computers to limit commanded load factors (e.g., +9g, -3g) to prevent pilots from exceeding structural limits.",
        "why_it_matters": "Ensures the aircraft is not flown outside its safe structural envelope, preventing structural failure. Automatic protection systems enhance safety by preventing pilots from accidentally exceeding these limits during aggressive maneuvering."

        "description": "One alternative is to draw a free-body diagram of the aircraft at the top of the inverted loop and analyze the balance of forces (Lift, Weight, Centripetal Force) to directly determine the load factor. Another approach involves using energy conservation to estimate the aircraft's speed at different points in the loop, which can then be used to calculate the required centripetal acceleration and infer the load factor.",

Energy-Based Approach: Pros: Gives physical insight into speed requirements and a numerical feel for g-levels. Cons: Does not directly yield load factor inequality, can be overkill for conceptual questions, and requires assumptions about speed/radius.",
        "when_to_use": "Free-Body Diagram: Useful for conceptual understanding and verifying formulas.

From a practical perspective, conventional aircraft have negative structural limits (e.g., -1g to -3g), implying that n must be greater than or equal to these limits (i.e., less negative than the limit) to avoid structural failure.",
