We can solve this using the principle of complementary counting:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of distinct arrangements without any restrictions:**\n    For 4 distinct persons to be seated in 4 distinct positions, the total number of arrangements is given by 4! (4 factorial).\n    4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of arrangements where the restriction IS violated (i.e., R IS seated at the second position):**\n    If R is fixed at the second position, we have 1 choice for the second position (R).\n    The remaining 3 persons (P, Q, S) can be arranged in the remaining 3 positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th) in 3! ways.\n    Number of arrangements with R at the second position = 1 × 3! = 1 × (3 × 2 × 1) = 6.\n\n3.  **Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:**\n    The number of distinct seating arrangements possible where R is NOT seated at the second position is:\n    Total arrangements - Arrangements where R IS at the second position\n    = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 18."
