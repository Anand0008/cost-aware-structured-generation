      "reasoning": "Based on thin airfoil theory:\n1.  **Option A:** The lift coefficient ($c_l$) for a thin airfoil is given by $c_l = 2\\pi (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle of attack and $\\alpha_{L=0}$ is the zero-lift angle of attack. This shows that $c_l$ is directly proportional to the absolute angle of attack. The universal lift slope $dc_l/d\\alpha = 2\\pi$ per radian for any thin airfoil confirms this linear relationship.\n2.  **Option B:** For any thin airfoil (symmetric or cambered), the aerodynamic center (AC) is located at the quarter-chord point ($c/4$). This is because the pitching moment coefficient about this point ($c_{m,ac}$) is constant and independent of the angle of attack.\n3.  **Option C:** For a *cambered* airfoil, the center of pressure (CP) is *not* fixed at the quarter-chord point; it moves with the lift coefficient (and thus with the angle of attack). For a symmetric airfoil, it is at $c/4$, but not for a cambered one in general. As lift approaches zero, the CP moves towards infinity.\n4.  **Option D:** Thin airfoil theory is an inviscid theory and, by definition, predicts zero drag (d'Alembert's paradox). Therefore, it does not provide any relationship for the drag coefficient, let alone one proportional to the square of the lift coefficient. The relationship $C_D = C_{D,0} + K C_L^2$ is for finite wings (induced drag) or includes viscous effects (profile drag), which are beyond the scope of thin airfoil theory."
