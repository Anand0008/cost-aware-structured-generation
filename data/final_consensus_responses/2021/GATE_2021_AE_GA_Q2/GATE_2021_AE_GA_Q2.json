      "reasoning": "A reflection about the x-axis transforms a point `(x, y)` to `(x, -y)`. This operation results in a vertical flip of the object or text. Each character in the word 'PHYLAXIS' must be individually reflected vertically. Let's analyze each character:\n- **P**: When flipped vertically, the loop of 'P' moves from the top-right to the bottom-right, resembling a lowercase 'b'.\n- **H**: 'H' is vertically symmetric, so it remains 'H'.\n- **Y**: 'Y' is vertically symmetric, so it remains 'Y'.\n- **L**: When flipped vertically, the horizontal bar of 'L' moves from the bottom to the top, resembling a lowercase 'r'.\n- **A**: 'A' is vertically symmetric, so it remains 'A'.\n- **X**: 'X' is vertically symmetric, so it remains 'X'.\n- **I**: 'I' is vertically symmetric, so it remains 'I'.\n- **S**: 'S' is generally considered vertically symmetric in many fonts, so it remains 'S' after a vertical flip.\n\nComparing this transformation to the given options:\n- **Option A**: Shows 'P' flipped horizontally, not vertically. 'L' is also flipped horizontally. Incorrect.\n- **Option B**: Shows 'bHYrAXIS'. This matches the vertical reflection of each character: 'P' becomes 'b', 'L' becomes 'r', and 'H', 'Y', 'A', 'X', 'I', 'S' remain visually similar due to their vertical symmetry or specific font rendering. This is the correct representation.\n- **Option C**: Shows 'P' rotated 180 degrees (appearing as 'd'), not reflected about the x-axis. Incorrect.\n- **Option D**: Shows 'S' flipped horizontally, not vertically.\n\nTherefore, Option B accurately represents the mirror image of 'PHYLAXIS' about the x-axis."
