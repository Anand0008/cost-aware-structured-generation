      "reasoning": "A supersonic diffuser is designed to decelerate a supersonic flow (M > 1) to a subsonic flow (M < 1). This process requires a specific geometry based on the area-velocity relation for compressible flow, which states: dA/A = (M^2 - 1) * dV/V.\n\n1.  **Supersonic Deceleration (M > 1):** To decelerate supersonic flow (i.e., decrease velocity, dV < 0), the term (M^2 - 1) is positive. For dA/A to be negative (required for dV < 0), the area must decrease. Thus, a **converging** duct is needed to slow down supersonic flow.\n2.  **Transition to Sonic (M = 1):** For the flow to transition from supersonic to subsonic, it must pass through sonic conditions (M = 1). At M = 1, the area-velocity relation implies dA = 0, which corresponds to a **throat** (minimum area).\n3.  **Subsonic Deceleration (M < 1):** After passing through the throat, the flow becomes subsonic. To further decelerate subsonic flow (dV < 0), the term (M^2 - 1) is negative. For dA/A to be negative (required for dV < 0), the area must increase. Thus, a **diverging** duct is needed to slow down subsonic flow.\n\nCombining these requirements, a supersonic diffuser that slows down supersonic flow to subsonic flow must first converge to decelerate the supersonic flow, pass through a throat at sonic conditions, and then diverge to further decelerate the subsonic flow. This geometry is known as a **converging–diverging** duct."

        "For supersonic flow (M > 1), to decelerate the flow (du < 0), the area-velocity relation `dA/A = (M^2 - 1) * du/u` implies that `dA` must be negative (since M^2-1 > 0). Therefore, the initial section of the diffuser must be **converging** to slow down the supersonic flow.",
        "To transition from supersonic to subsonic flow, the flow must pass through sonic conditions (M = 1). At M = 1, the area-velocity relation `dA/A = (M^2 - 1) * du/u` implies that `dA = 0` for a finite `du`. This point of minimum area is known as the **throat**.",
        "After passing through the throat, the flow becomes subsonic (M < 1). For subsonic flow, (M^2 - 1) is negative. To continue decelerating the flow (du < 0), the area-velocity relation requires `dA` to be positive. Therefore, the final section of the diffuser must be **diverging**.",
