      "reasoning": "The problem involves determining the shear stress in a common wall of a two-cell thin-walled section subjected to torsion. This is a statically indeterminate problem requiring the application of two fundamental principles:\n\n1.  **Torque Equilibrium:** The total applied torque ($T$) is distributed among the cells. For each cell, the torque carried is given by $T_i = 2 A_i q_i$, where $A_i$ is the enclosed area of the cell and $q_i$ is the circulating shear flow within that cell.\n2.  **Compatibility of Twist Rates:** For a continuous structure, the rate of twist ($d\\theta/dz$) must be the same for all cells. The rate of twist for a closed cell is given by $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{1}{2 A G} \\oint \\frac{q}{t} ds$, where $G$ is the shear modulus, $t$ is the wall thickness, and $\\oint \\frac{q}{t} ds$ is the integral of $q/t$ around the perimeter of the cell.\n\n**Given Data (from image interpretation):**\n*   Cell I (FADE) dimensions: Width = 200 mm, Height = 300 mm\n*   Cell II (ABCD) dimensions: Width = 300 mm, Height = 300 mm\n*   Wall thickness ($t$) = 1.5 mm\n*   Shear Modulus ($G$) = 27 GPa = 27,000 N/mm$^2$\n*   Applied Torque ($T$) = 12 kNm = 12 $\\times$ 10$^6$ Nmm\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**1. Calculate Cell Areas:**\n*   Area of Cell I ($A_1$) = 200 mm $\\times$ 300 mm = 60,000 mm$^2$\n*   Area of Cell II ($A_2$) = 300 mm $\\times$ 300 mm = 90,000 mm$^2$\n\n**2. Formulate Torque Equilibrium Equation:**\nLet $q_1$ be the counter-clockwise (CCW) shear flow in Cell I and $q_2$ be the CCW shear flow in Cell II.\n$T = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2$\n$12 \\times 10^6 = 2 \\times (60000) q_1 + 2 \\times (90000) q_2$\n$12 \\times 10^6 = 120000 q_1 + 180000 q_2$\nDividing by 60000: $200 = 2 q_1 + 3 q_2$ (Equation 1)\n\n**3. Formulate Compatibility Equation (Equal Rate of Twist):**\nThe rate of twist for Cell I: $(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz})_1 = \\frac{1}{2 A_1 G} \\oint_{Cell I} \\frac{q}{t} ds$\nThe rate of twist for Cell II: $(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz})_2 = \\frac{1}{2 A_2 G} \\oint_{Cell II} \\frac{q}{t} ds$\n\nFor the integral $\\oint \\frac{q}{t} ds$:\n*   **For Cell I (FADE):** The perimeter consists of walls FA (200 mm), FE (300 mm), ED (200 mm), and the common wall AD (300 mm). Assuming $q_1$ is CCW, it flows A$\\to$D. Assuming $q_2$ is CCW, it flows D$\\to$A. So, the net shear flow in AD, from Cell I's perspective (A$\\to$D), is $(q_1 - q_2)$.\n    $\\oint_{Cell I} \\frac{q}{t} ds = \\frac{q_1 \\times 200}{t} + \\frac{q_1 \\times 300}{t} + \\frac{q_1 \\times 200}{t} + \\frac{(q_1 - q_2) \\times 300}{t}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{t} [q_1 (200+300+200+300) - q_2 (300)] = \\frac{1}{t} (1000 q_1 - 300 q_2)$\n\n*   **For Cell II (ABCD):** The perimeter consists of walls AB (300 mm), BC (300 mm), CD (300 mm), and the common wall AD (300 mm). From Cell II's perspective (D$\\to$A), the net shear flow in AD is $(q_2 - q_1)$.\n    $\\oint_{Cell II} \\frac{q}{t} ds = \\frac{q_2 \\times 300}{t} + \\frac{q_2 \\times 300}{t} + \\frac{q_2 \\times 300}{t} + \\frac{(q_2 - q_1) \\times 300}{t}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{t} [q_2 (300+300+300+300) - q_1 (300)] = \\frac{1}{t} (1200 q_2 - 300 q_1)$\n\nEquating the rates of twist $(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz})_1 = (\\frac{d\\theta}{dz})_2$:\n$\\frac{1}{2 A_1 G} \\frac{1}{t} (1000 q_1 - 300 q_2) = \\frac{1}{2 A_2 G} \\frac{1}{t} (1200 q_2 - 300 q_1)$\nCanceling common terms $(1/(2Gt))$:\n$\\frac{1}{A_1} (1000 q_1 - 300 q_2) = \\frac{1}{A_2} (1200 q_2 - 300 q_1)$\n$\\frac{1}{60000} (1000 q_1 - 300 q_2) = \\frac{1}{90000} (1200 q_2 - 300 q_1)$\nMultiplying by 180000 (LCM of 60000 and 90000):\n$3 (1000 q_1 - 300 q_2) = 2 (1200 q_2 - 300 q_1)$\n$3000 q_1 - 900 q_2 = 2400 q_2 - 600 q_1$\n$3600 q_1 = 3300 q_2$\nDividing by 300: $12 q_1 = 11 q_2$ (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Solve Simultaneous Equations:**\nFrom Equation 2, $q_2 = \\frac{12}{11} q_1$.\nSubstitute into Equation 1:\n$2 q_1 + 3 (\\frac{12}{11} q_1) = 200$\n$2 q_1 + \\frac{36}{11} q_1 = 200$\n$\\frac{22}{11} q_1 + \\frac{36}{11} q_1 = 200$\n$\\frac{58}{11} q_1 = 200$\n$q_1 = \\frac{200 \\times 11}{58} = \\frac{2200}{58} = \\frac{1100}{29} \\approx 37.931$ N/mm\n\n$q_2 = \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{1100}{29} = \\frac{12 \\times 100}{29} = \\frac{1200}{29} \\approx 41.379$ N/mm\n\n**5. Calculate Shear Flow in Wall AD ($q_{AD}$):**\nThe shear flow in the common wall AD is the difference between the shear flows of the two cells. If we consider the direction A$\\to$D as positive, then:\n$q_{AD} = q_1 - q_2 = \\frac{1100}{29} - \\frac{1200}{29} = -\\frac{100}{29}$ N/mm\nThe magnitude of shear flow in AD is $|q_{AD}| = \\frac{100}{29} \\approx 3.448$ N/mm.\n\n**6. Calculate Shear Stress in Wall AD ($\\tau_{AD}$):**\n$\\tau_{AD} = \\frac{|q_{AD}|}{t} = \\frac{100/29}{1.5} = \\frac{100}{29 \\times 1.5} = \\frac{100}{43.5} \\approx 2.29885$ MPa\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, $\\tau_{AD} \\approx 2.3$ MPa. This value falls within the specified official answer range of 2.1 to 2.5 MPa."

From the figure, determine the dimensions of Cell I (200 mm x 300 mm) and Cell II (300 mm x 300 mm). Calculate their enclosed areas: A_1 = 0.2 m * 0.3 m = 0.06 m^2 and A_2 = 0.3 m * 0.3 m = 0.09 m^2.",
        "Step 2: Assume positive directions for the circulating shear flows q1 in Cell I and q2 in Cell II (e.g., both clockwise).",
        "Step 3: Formulate the torque equilibrium equation for the multi-cell section: T = 2 A_1 q_1 + 2 A_2 q_2. Substitute the given torque and calculated areas: 12 × 10^3 Nm = 2(0.06 m^2) q_1 + 2(0.09 m^2) q_2, which simplifies to 0.12 q_1 + 0.18 q_2 = 12 × 10^3.",
        "Step 4: Formulate the compatibility condition, stating that the rate of twist (dθ/dz) must be the same for both cells. Use the formula: dθ/dz = (1 / (2 A G)) ∮ (q/t) ds.",
        "Step 5: For the compatibility equation, calculate the line integral ∮ (q/t) ds for each cell. In the common wall AD, the net shear flow is (q1 - q2) (assuming q1 and q2 are clockwise). Equate the rates of twist for Cell I and Cell II to obtain a second linear equation relating q1 and q2.",
        "Step 6: Solve the system of two linear equations (from Step 3 and Step 5) simultaneously to determine the shear flows q1 and q2.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the net shear flow in the common wall AD, q_AD, using the determined values of q1 and q2. For clockwise q1 and q2, q_AD = q1 - q2.",
        "Step 8: Compute the shear stress in wall AD using the formula τ_AD = |q_AD| / t. Convert the result to MPa."
