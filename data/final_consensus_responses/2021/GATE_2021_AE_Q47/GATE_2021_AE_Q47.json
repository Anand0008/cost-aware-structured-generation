      "reasoning": "From the derived formula for degree of reaction in axial turbines: $R = \\frac{c_a}{2u} (\\tan \\beta_2 - \\tan \\beta_1)$, where $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are rotor inlet and outlet relative angles, $u$ is blade speed, $c_a$ is axial velocity. Given $R=0.4$, $u=340$ m/s, $\\beta_1=21^\\circ$, $\\beta_2=55^\\circ$. Calculate $c_a = \\frac{2u R}{\\tan \\beta_2 - \\tan \\beta_1} = \\frac{2 \\times 340 \\times 0.4}{\\tan 55^\\circ - \\tan 21^\\circ} = \\frac{272}{1.428148 - 0.383864} \\approx \\frac{272}{1.044284} \\approx 260.46$ m/s. Then mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = \\rho A c_a = 0.9 \\times 0.08 \\times 260.46 \\approx 18.753$ kg/s. Rounding to two decimal places, the flow rate is 18.75 kg/s, which is within the official answer range of 18.0 to 19.5 kg/s.
