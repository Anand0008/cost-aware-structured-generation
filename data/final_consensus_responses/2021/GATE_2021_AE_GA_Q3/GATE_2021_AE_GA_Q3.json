      "reasoning": "The question asks for the probability that an even number is rolled on each of two identical dice. \n\nFor a single die, the possible outcomes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The total number of outcomes is 6.\n\nThe even numbers in this set are {2, 4, 6}. The number of favorable outcomes (even numbers) is 3.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a single die is given by:\n$P(\\text{Even}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince the two dice are rolled simultaneously and are independent events, the probability that an even number is rolled on *each* die is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$P(\\text{Even on Die 1 AND Even on Die 2}) = P(\\text{Even on Die 1}) \\times P(\\text{Even on Die 2})$\n$P(\\text{Even on both dice}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nAlternatively, the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is $6 \\times 6 = 36$. The number of favorable outcomes (even on both dice) is $3 \\times 3 = 9$ (since there are 3 even numbers on each die). So, the probability is $\\frac{9}{36} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis matches option D."
