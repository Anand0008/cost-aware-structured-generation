        "description": "One alternative is Dimensional Analysis (Buckingham Pi Theorem), which establishes the functional relationship between $\\delta$, $x$, $U$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$, yielding $\\frac{\\delta}{x} = f(\\text{Re}_x)$ and inferring the $U^{-1/2}$ dependence. Another method is the Integral Boundary Layer Approach, which involves solving the integral momentum equation for the boundary layer to derive the relationship without the full Blasius solution.",
        "pros_cons": "Dimensional Analysis Pros: Provides insight into fundamental scaling laws, useful when exact analytical solution is unknown. Cons: Does not provide the numerical constant (e.g., 5.0), requires careful variable selection. Integral Approach Pros: More general, applicable to various pressure gradient conditions. Cons: Requires more mathematical sophistication than Blasius solution.",
        "when_to_use": "When the exact constant is not required, to verify functional dependence, when an analytical solution is too complex/unavailable, or when studying theory to reconstruct scaling from governing equations."

Thermal boundary layer thickness in laminar flow has similar scaling with x and U, affecting convective heat transfer.",

      "Control Systems": "Boundary layer control (e.g., suction, blowing) can be seen as a system input modifying the state (thickness, transition), linking aerodynamics with actuation and feedback concepts.",
