        "Step 6: Classify the orbit based on the specific mechanical energy. If ε < 0, the orbit is bound (elliptic or circular). If ε = 0, it's parabolic (escape trajectory). If ε > 0, it's hyperbolic (escape trajectory). Since ε is negative, the orbit is bound and either elliptic or circular.",
        "Step 7: To distinguish between a circular and an elliptic orbit, calculate the circular velocity (V_c) at the current radial distance: V_c = √(μ/r). For the given values, V_c = √(5.69×10⁷) ≈ 7.5 km/s. Since the vehicle's speed (9 km/s) is greater than the circular velocity (7.5 km/s) but less than the escape velocity (which would be √(2μ/r) ≈ 10.6 km/s), the orbit cannot be circular; it is an elliptic orbit."
