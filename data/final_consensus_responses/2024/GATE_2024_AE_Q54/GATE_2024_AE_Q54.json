      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the magnitude of the maximum normal stress in a thin-walled C-section beam subjected to a bending moment $M_x$. The fundamental formula for bending stress is the flexure formula: $\\sigma = \\frac{M_x y}{I_x}$.\n\n1.  **Identify Centroidal Axis (Neutral Axis):** From the provided image, the C-section is symmetric about the horizontal x-axis. Therefore, the x-axis shown is the neutral axis for bending due to $M_x$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moment of Inertia ($I_x$) about the Neutral Axis:** The C-section consists of a vertical web and two horizontal flanges. We use the parallel axis theorem and the thin-wall approximation (neglecting terms with $t^3$).\n    *   **Vertical Web:** Dimensions are height $h$ and thickness $t$. Its centroid lies on the x-axis.\n        $I_{x,web} = \\frac{t h^3}{12}$\n    *   **Two Horizontal Flanges:** Each flange has a length of $h/2$ and thickness $t$. The centroid of each flange is located at a distance $d = h/2$ from the neutral axis (x-axis). For thin-walled sections, the moment of inertia of a flange about its own centroidal axis parallel to the bending axis ($I_{x,self} = \\frac{(h/2) t^3}{12}$) is negligible compared to the $A d^2$ term.\n        Area of one flange $A_{flange} = (h/2)t$.\n        Moment of inertia for one flange about the x-axis: $I_{x,flange} \\approx A_{flange} d^2 = (\\frac{h}{2}t) (\\frac{h}{2})^2 = \\frac{t h^3}{8}$.\n    *   **Total Moment of Inertia ($I_x$):** Summing the contributions from the web and two flanges:\n        $I_x = I_{x,web} + 2 \\times I_{x,flange} = \\frac{t h^3}{12} + 2 \\times \\frac{t h^3}{8} = \\frac{t h^3}{12} + \\frac{t h^3}{4} = \\frac{t h^3 + 3 t h^3}{12} = \\frac{4 t h^3}{12} = \\frac{t h^3}{3}$.\n    *   **Substitute given values:** $h = 1$ m, $t = 0.001$ m.\n        $I_x = \\frac{0.001 \\cdot (1)^3}{3} = \\frac{0.001}{3} = \\frac{1}{3000}$ m$^4$.\n\n3.  **Determine Maximum Distance ($y_{max}$) from Neutral Axis:** The maximum normal stress occurs at the extreme fibers, which are the top and bottom edges of the flanges. The distance from the neutral axis (x-axis) to these points is $y_{max} = h/2 = 1/2 = 0.5$ m.\n\n4.  **Calculate Maximum Normal Stress ($\\sigma_{max}$):**\n    Given bending moment $M_x = 10$ Nm.\n    $\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M_x y_{max}}{I_x} = \\frac{10 \\text{ Nm} \\cdot 0.5 \\text{ m}}{\\frac{1}{3000} \\text{ m}^4} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{1}{3000}} = 5 \\times 3000 = 15000$ N/m$^2$.\n\nThe calculated value of $15000$ N/m$^2$ falls within the acceptable range of $14900$ to $15100$ specified in the answer key."
