      "reasoning": "The problem states that $(x + y)$ is proportional to $(x - y)$. This can be written as an equation: $(x + y) = k(x - y)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\nGiven that $x$ and $y$ are distinct non-zero real variables, we know $x \\neq y$, so $(x - y) \\neq 0$, which ensures $k$ is well-defined. Also, $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$.\n\nTo find the value of $x/y$, we rearrange the equation:\n$x + y = kx - ky$\nGroup terms with $x$ and $y$:\n$y + ky = kx - x$\nFactor out $y$ and $x$:\n$y(1 + k) = x(k - 1)$\nNow, form the ratio $x/y$:\n$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1 + k}{k - 1}$\n\nWe must ensure that $k - 1 \\neq 0$, i.e., $k \\neq 1$. If $k=1$, then $x+y = x-y$, which implies $2y=0$, so $y=0$. This contradicts the given condition that $y$ is a non-zero variable. Therefore, $k \\neq 1$.\nAlso, if $1+k=0$, then $k=-1$. In this case, $x+y = -(x-y) \\implies x+y = -x+y \\implies 2x=0 \\implies x=0$. This contradicts the given condition that $x$ is a non-zero variable. Therefore, $k \\neq -1$.\n\nSince $k$ is a constant and $k \\neq \\pm 1$, the ratio $x/y$ is always a constant value, independent of the specific values of $x$ and $y$ (as long as they satisfy the given proportionality and distinct non-zero conditions)."
