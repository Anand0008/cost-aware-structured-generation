      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio of the speed of the satellite at perigee to that at apogee. For an elliptical orbit, the angular momentum ($L$) of the satellite about the central body (Moon) is conserved. At both perigee and apogee, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector. Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum simplifies to $m \\cdot r_p \\cdot V_p = m \\cdot r_a \\cdot V_a$, where $r_p$ and $V_p$ are the radius and speed at perigee, and $r_a$ and $V_a$ are the radius and speed at apogee. This simplifies to $r_p \\cdot V_p = r_a \\cdot V_a$. The ratio of speeds is then $V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p$.\n\nGiven data:\n- Altitude at perigee ($h_p$) = 25 km\n- Altitude at apogee ($h_a$) = 134 km\n- Moon's radius ($R_M$) = 1737 km\n\nFirst, calculate the radii from the center of the Moon:\n- Perigee radius ($r_p$) = $R_M + h_p = 1737 \\text{ km} + 25 \\text{ km} = 1762 \\text{ km}$\n- Apogee radius ($r_a$) = $R_M + h_a = 1737 \\text{ km} + 134 \\text{ km} = 1871 \\text{ km}$\n\nNow, calculate the ratio of speeds:\n$V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p = 1871 \\text{ km} / 1762 \\text{ km} \\approx 1.06186$\n\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, the ratio is 1.06."

        "Step 2: Calculate the orbital radii from the Moon's center. Perigee radius (r_p) = R_m + h_p = 1737 + 25 = 1762 km. Apogee radius (r_a) = R_m + h_a = 1737 + 134 = 1871 km.",
        "Step 3: Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum. For a satellite in an elliptical orbit under a central gravitational force, its specific angular momentum (h) is conserved. At perigee and apogee, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector, simplifying the angular momentum equation to h = r_p * v_p = r_a * v_a.",
        "Step 4: Formulate the relationship between speeds and radii based on conservation of angular momentum: m * r_p * V_p = m * r_a * V_a. This simplifies to r_p * V_p = r_a * V_a, which can be rearranged to find the speed ratio: V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the ratio of speeds by substituting the calculated radii: V_p / V_a = r_a / r_p = 1871 km / 1762 km = 1.06186.",
