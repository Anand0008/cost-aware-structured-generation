      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the number of stages in a multistage axial compressor given its overall isentropic efficiency, inlet stagnation temperature, overall pressure ratio, and the stagnation temperature rise per stage. We need to calculate the actual total stagnation temperature rise across the compressor and then divide it by the temperature rise per stage.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the ideal (isentropic) stagnation temperature at the compressor outlet.**\nFor an isentropic compression process, the relation between stagnation temperature and pressure is:\n`T_{t,out,isentropic} = T_{t,in} \\left(\\frac{P_{t,out}}{P_{t,in}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}}`\nGiven `T_{t,in} = 300 \\text{ K}`, `P_{t,out}/P_{t,in} = 10`, and `\\gamma = 1.4`:\n`T_{t,out,isentropic} = 300 \\times (10)^{\\frac{1.4 - 1}{1.4}} = 300 \\times (10)^{\\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 300 \\times (10)^{0.2857}`\n`T_{t,out,isentropic} \\approx 300 \\times 1.9307 = 579.21 \\text{ K}`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the actual stagnation temperature at the compressor outlet using the overall isentropic efficiency.**\nThe overall isentropic efficiency (`\\eta_{overall}`) for a compressor is defined as:\n`\\eta_{overall} = \\frac{T_{t,out,isentropic} - T_{t,in}}{T_{t,out,actual} - T_{t,in}}`\nGiven `\\eta_{overall} = 0.83`:\n`0.83 = \\frac{579.21 - 300}{T_{t,out,actual} - 300}`\n`0.83 = \\frac{279.21}{T_{t,out,actual} - 300}`\n`T_{t,out,actual} - 300 = \\frac{279.21}{0.83} \\approx 336.40 \\text{ K}`\n`T_{t,out,actual} = 300 + 336.40 = 636.40 \\text{ K}`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total actual stagnation temperature rise across the compressor.**\n`\\Delta T_{t,overall,actual} = T_{t,out,actual} - T_{t,in} = 636.40 - 300 = 336.40 \\text{ K}`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of stages.**\nSince each stage provides a stagnation temperature rise of `20 K`, the number of stages (`N`) is:\n`N = \\frac{\\Delta T_{t,overall,actual}}{\\Delta T_{t,stage}} = \\frac{336.40}{20} = 16.82`\nSince the number of stages must be an integer, and `16` stages would not achieve the required total temperature rise (and thus pressure ratio), we must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, `17` stages are required to achieve the desired overall pressure ratio.\n\nThus, the correct option is A."
