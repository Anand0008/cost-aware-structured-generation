      "reasoning": "For a single degree of freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper system subjected to harmonic forcing, the total response is a superposition of two main parts: the transient response and the steady-state response. The transient response, also known as the homogeneous solution or free vibration part, depends on the system's initial conditions and contains an exponential decay term (e.g., $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$) due to the presence of damping. This term causes the amplitude of the transient motion to decrease over time, eventually decaying to zero. The steady-state response, or particular solution, is driven by the external harmonic force and persists indefinitely, oscillating at the forcing frequency without decay. Therefore, the part of the motion that decays due to damping is correctly identified as the transient response."

        "A single degree of freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper system under harmonic forcing is governed by the equation of motion: $m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$.",
        "The total response of such a system, $x(t)$, is composed of two main parts: the complementary solution (or transient response, $x_{transient}(t)$) and the particular solution (or steady-state response, $x_{steady-state}(t)$). Thus, $x(t) = x_{transient}(t) + x_{steady-state}(t)$.",
        "The transient response, $x_{transient}(t)$, arises from the system's initial conditions and represents its natural tendency to vibrate. For a damped system, it has the form $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}(A \\cos(\\omega_d t) + B \\sin(\\omega_d t))$. The exponential term $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$ causes its amplitude to decay to zero over time due to damping.",
        "The steady-state response, $x_{steady-state}(t)$, is directly driven by the external harmonic forcing function. It persists as long as the forcing is applied, oscillating at the same frequency as the forcing function, and does not decay. Its form is typically $X_0 \\sin(\\omega t - \\phi)$.",
        "The question asks for the part of the motion that 'decays due to damping'. Based on the characteristics described, this property belongs exclusively to the transient response.",
        "Therefore, the transient response is the correct answer."
