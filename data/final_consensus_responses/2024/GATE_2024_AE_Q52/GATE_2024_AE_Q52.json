      "reasoning": "The problem involves two separate loading cases that are superimposed to find the resultant stress state. The goal is to find the sum of the maximum and minimum principal stresses for this resultant state.\n\n1.  **Analyze Case I: Uniaxial tension along x' (10 N/mm²)**\n    The stress state in the x'y' coordinate system is: $\\sigma_{x'} = 10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $\\sigma_{y'} = 0$, $\\tau_{x'y'} = 0$.\n    The x' axis is oriented at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ with respect to the x-axis.\n    Using plane stress transformation equations to find stresses in the xy system:\n    $\\sigma_x^{(I)} = \\sigma_{x'} \\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma_{y'} \\sin^2\\theta + 2\\tau_{x'y'} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = 10 \\cos^2(45^\\circ) + 0 + 0 = 10 (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\sigma_y^{(I)} = \\sigma_{x'} \\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_{y'} \\cos^2\\theta - 2\\tau_{x'y'} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = 10 \\sin^2(45^\\circ) + 0 + 0 = 10 (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\tau_{xy}^{(I)} = -(\\sigma_{x'} - \\sigma_{y'}) \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta + \\tau_{x'y'} (\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) = -(10 - 0) \\sin(45^\\circ) \\cos(45^\\circ) = -10 (1/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = -5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze Case II: Uniaxial compression along y' (10 N/mm²)**\n    The stress state in the x'y' coordinate system is: $\\sigma_{x'} = 0$, $\\sigma_{y'} = -10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$, $\\tau_{x'y'} = 0$.\n    The y' axis is oriented at $45^\\circ$ from the y-axis, which means the x' axis is still at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ from the x-axis.\n    Using plane stress transformation equations:\n    $\\sigma_x^{(II)} = \\sigma_{x'} \\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma_{y'} \\sin^2\\theta + 2\\tau_{x'y'} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = 0 + (-10) \\sin^2(45^\\circ) + 0 = -10 (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = -5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\sigma_y^{(II)} = \\sigma_{x'} \\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_{y'} \\cos^2\\theta - 2\\tau_{x'y'} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = 0 + (-10) \\cos^2(45^\\circ) + 0 = -10 (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = -5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\tau_{xy}^{(II)} = -(\\sigma_{x'} - \\sigma_{y'}) \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta + \\tau_{x'y'} (\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) = -(0 - (-10)) \\sin(45^\\circ) \\cos(45^\\circ) = -10 (1/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = -5 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n\n3.  **Apply Superposition for Resultant Stress State:**\n    Add the corresponding stress components from Case I and Case II:\n    $\\sigma_{x,res} = \\sigma_x^{(I)} + \\sigma_x^{(II)} = 5 + (-5) = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\sigma_{y,res} = \\sigma_y^{(I)} + \\sigma_y^{(II)} = 5 + (-5) = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    $\\tau_{xy,res} = \\tau_{xy}^{(I)} + \\tau_{xy}^{(II)} = -5 + (-5) = -10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    The resultant stress state in the xy system is $\\sigma_x = 0$, $\\sigma_y = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = -10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$. This is a state of pure shear.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Sum of Maximum and Minimum Principal Stresses:**\n    A key property of plane stress is that the sum of the normal stresses is an invariant, meaning it remains constant regardless of the coordinate system's orientation. This implies that the sum of the principal stresses ($\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2$) is equal to the sum of the normal stresses in any orthogonal coordinate system (e.g., $\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y$).\n    Therefore, for the resultant stress state:\n    $\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{x,res} + \\sigma_{y,res} = 0 + 0 = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the principal stresses explicitly for the resultant state:\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{0 - 0}{2}\\right)^2 + (-10)^2}$\n    $\\sigma_{1,2} = 0 \\pm \\sqrt{0 + 100} = \\pm 10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n    So, the maximum principal stress is $\\sigma_1 = 10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$ and the minimum principal stress is $\\sigma_2 = -10 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n    The sum is $\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 = 10 + (-10) = 0 \\text{ N/mm}^2$.\n\nThe final answer is 0.0 N/mm²."

Similarly, analyzing stress distribution in a wing box involves combining bending, torsion, and shear forces. Engineers superimpose stress states from different load cases (e.g., lift, drag, engine thrust) and transform them to critical orientations to understand principal stresses, which is crucial for designing these components to withstand loads without failure.",

Failure to do so can lead to premature fatigue, yielding, fracture, or catastrophic failure of components, compromising flight safety, increasing maintenance costs, and potentially leading to over-designed components (excessive weight)."

It involves plotting the stress state on a $\\sigma - \\tau$ diagram and drawing a circle.
