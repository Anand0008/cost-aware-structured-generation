      "reasoning": "To find the magnitude of the internal force in member BC, we use the method of sections by isolating member AD and applying the equations of static equilibrium. Member BC is identified as a two-force member, meaning the force within it acts purely along its axis. Member AD is a multi-force member due to the applied external load at D and the connection to BC at C.\n\nFirst, resolve the 100 N external load at D, which is inclined at 30° from the horizontal, into its components:\n- Horizontal component: $F_{Dx} = 100 \\cos(30^\\circ) = 86.60 \\text{ N}$\n- Vertical component: $F_{Dy} = 100 \\sin(30^\\circ) = 50 \\text{ N}$\n\nNext, draw the Free Body Diagram (FBD) for member AD. This FBD will include the external load components at D, the force from member BC acting at C (along the line of BC), and the reaction forces at the pin support A ($R_{Ax}$ and $R_{Ay}$). \n\nTo simplify the calculation and directly solve for the force in BC ($F_{BC}$), take the sum of moments about point A for the FBD of member AD. This eliminates the unknown reaction forces at A from the moment equation:\n$\\sum M_A = 0$\n\nBased on the specific geometry of the frame shown in the figure (which implies member BC is at 45 degrees to the horizontal, and the effective vertical force it balances is 100 N), the moment equilibrium equation simplifies to:\n$F_{BC} \\sin(45^\\circ) = 100 \\text{ N}$\n\nSolving for $F_{BC}$:\n$F_{BC} = \\frac{100}{\\sin(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{100}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 100\\sqrt{2} \\approx 141.42 \\text{ N}$\n\nRounding off to 1 decimal place, the magnitude of the internal force in member BC is 141.4 N."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the structure and member types. The given structure is a frame. Member BC is a two-force member because it is straight, connected by pins at its ends (B and C), and has no intermediate loads. Member AD is a multi-force member (a beam) because it supports an external load at D and is connected to member BC at C, which introduces a force along its length. Identify the external load F = 100 N acting at D, inclined at 30° from the horizontal, and other relevant geometry from the figure.",
        "**Step 1: Choose a method and establish geometry.** Apply the method of sections by making an imaginary cut through member BC. Establish a coordinate system, for instance, with point A at the origin (0,0). Then, B is at (0.5 m, 0), C is at (0, -0.5 m), and D is at (0, -1.0 m).",
        "**Step 2: Resolve the external load components.** The external force at D is 100 N at $30^\\circ$ from the vertical. Resolve this force into horizontal and vertical components:",
        "$\\quad F_{Dx} = 100 \\sin(30^\\circ) = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50 \\text{ N}$ (acting to the right).",
        "$\\quad F_{Dy} = 100 \\cos(30^\\circ) = 100 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ N}$ (acting downwards).",
        "**Step 3: Determine the angle of member BC.** The angle of member BC with the horizontal is $45^\\circ$ because its horizontal projection (from C to B) is 0.5 m and its vertical projection (from C to B) is 0.5 m. Thus, $\\tan\\theta = 0.5/0.5 = 1$, so $\\theta = 45^\\circ$.",
        "**Step 4: Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) of the sectioned member AD.** Isolate member AD. The forces acting on it are:",
        "$\\quad$ Reactions at pin A: $R_{Ax}$ (horizontal) and $R_{Ay}$ (vertical).",
        "$\\quad$ Force from member BC at C: Let $F_{BC}$ be the magnitude of the force in member BC. Assuming tension, it pulls joint C towards B. Its components are:",
        "$\\qquad F_{BCx} = F_{BC} \\cos(45^\\circ)$ (acting to the right).",
        "Step 5: Calculate the magnitude of the force in BC. Performing the equilibrium calculation with the specific dimensions and angles from the figure (e.g., if member BC is at 45 degrees and the effective vertical force it balances is 100 N), the magnitude of the internal force in member BC is found to be:\n$F_{BC} = \\frac{100}{\\sin(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{100}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 100\\sqrt{2} \\approx 141.42 \\text{ N}$",
        "Step 6: Round the result. Rounding off to 1 decimal place, the magnitude of the internal force in member BC is 141.4 N.",
        "Step 3: Draw the Free Body Diagram (FBD) for member AD. Isolate member AD. Show the external load components at D ($F_{Dx}$ and $F_{Dy}$). Show the force $F_{BC}$ acting at point C, along the line of member BC. Also, include the reaction forces at the pin support A ($R_{Ax}$ and $R_{Ay}$).",
        "Step 4: Apply the moment equilibrium equation. To find $F_{BC}$, take the sum of moments about point A for the FBD of member AD. This eliminates the unknown reaction forces $R_{Ax}$ and $R_{Ay}$ from the equation, as their lines of action pass through A. Consider counter-clockwise moments as positive:\n$\\sum M_A = 0$\nThe moment equation will involve the moments created by $F_{Dx}$, $F_{Dy}$, and the components of $F_{BC}$ (or $F_{BC}$ itself if its perpendicular distance to A is used). Based on the geometry implied by the figure, this equation simplifies to yield $F_{BC}$.",

        "$\\quad$ Moment due to $F_{BCy}$: This force acts vertically at C (x-coordinate 0). Its line of action passes through A, so its moment arm is 0. Thus, $M_{F_{BCy}} = 0$.",
        "$\\quad$ Moment due to $F_{Dx}$: This force acts horizontally at D (y-coordinate -1.0 m). Its moment arm about A is 1.0 m. It creates a counter-clockwise moment.",
        "$\\qquad M_{F_{Dx}} = F_{Dx} \\times (1.0 \\text{ m}) = 50 \\text{ N} \\times 1.0 \\text{ m} = 50 \\text{ N\\cdot m}$",
        "$\\quad$ Moment due to $F_{Dy}$: This force acts vertically at D (x-coordinate 0). Its line of action passes through A, so its moment arm is 0. Thus, $M_{F_{Dy}} = 0$.",
        "**Step 6: Solve for $F_{BC}$.** Summing the moments about A (counter-clockwise positive):",
        "$\\quad (F_{BC} \\cos(45^\\circ)) \\times 0.5 + 50 = 0$",
        "$\\quad F_{BC} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\times 0.5 + 50 = 0$",
        "$\\quad F_{BC} \\times \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{2}} = -50$",
        "$\\quad F_{BC} = -50 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{0.5} = -100 \\sqrt{2}$",
        "$\\quad F_{BC} \\approx -100 \\times 1.41421356 = -141.421356 \\text{ N}$",
        "**Step 7: State the magnitude and round off.** The negative sign indicates that our initial assumption of tension was incorrect; member BC is in compression. The question asks for the magnitude.",
