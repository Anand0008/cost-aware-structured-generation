      "reasoning": "The drag force per unit span ($D$) on the airfoil can be determined using the integral momentum equation applied to the control volume. Given that the static pressure $p_{\\infty}$ is constant over the entire control volume, the drag force is solely due to the momentum deficit in the wake. The formula for drag per unit span for incompressible, steady, two-dimensional flow with constant far-field pressure is $D = \\int \\rho u (U_{\\infty} - u) dy$, where $u$ is the local velocity in the wake and $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity.\n\nThe velocity profile at the downstream end (surface 4) is given as $u(y) = (y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $0 \\le y \\le H_D$ and $u(y) = (-y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $-H_D \\le y < 0$. This means the velocity varies linearly from $0$ at the center of the wake ($y=0$) to $U_{\\infty}$ at the edges ($y=\\pm H_D$).\n\nThe integral can be evaluated as:\n$D = \\int_{-H_D}^{H_D} \\rho u(y) (U_{\\infty} - u(y)) dy$\nDue to symmetry, this can be written as:\n$D = 2 \\int_{0}^{H_D} \\rho (y/H_D) U_{\\infty} (U_{\\infty} - (y/H_D) U_{\\infty}) dy$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 \\int_{0}^{H_D} (y/H_D) (1 - y/H_D) dy$\nLet $\\eta = y/H_D$, so $dy = H_D d\\eta$. The limits change from $0$ to $1$.\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D \\int_{0}^{1} (\\eta - \\eta^2) d\\eta$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D [\\frac{\\eta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\eta^3}{3}]_{0}^{1}$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3})$\n$D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D (\\frac{1}{6})$\n$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D$\n\nGiven $H_D = 0.03c$:\n$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 (0.03c) = 0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c$\n\nThe drag coefficient $C_d$ is defined as $C_d = D / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c)$.\n$C_d = (0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) = 0.01 / 0.5 = 0.02$.\n\nRounded off to 3 decimal places, $C_d = 0.020$."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. The drag force on the airfoil can be calculated using the integral momentum equation applied to the control volume shown in the figure. Identify the control volume, assumptions (incompressible, steady, 2D flow), and that static pressure $p_{\\infty}$ is constant over the entire control volume surface.",
        "Step 2: Apply the x-momentum conservation to the control volume. The net force on the fluid in the x-direction equals the net momentum flux out. Pressure forces cancel because $p_{\\infty}$ is constant. The airfoil exerts a force -D on the fluid. Thus, the drag force D is related to the momentum flux changes across the volume.",
        "Step 3: Recall the drag formula from momentum deficit for incompressible, steady, two-dimensional flow with constant pressure on the control surface: $D = \\int \\rho u (U_{\\infty} - u) dy$, where $u$ is the local velocity in the wake and $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity.",
        "Step 4: Define the integration limits and substitute the given velocity profile. The integration is performed over the wake region at the downstream end (surface 4), from $y = -H_D$ to $y = H_D$. The velocity profile is $u(y) = (y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $0 \\le y \\le H_D$ and $u(y) = (-y/H_D) U_{\\infty}$ for $-H_D \\le y < 0$.",
        "Step 5: Perform the integration. Due to symmetry, integrate from $0$ to $H_D$ and multiply by 2. Substitute $u(y)$ into the integral and evaluate: $D = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D \\int_{0}^{1} (\\eta - \\eta^2) d\\eta = 2 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D [\\frac{\\eta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\eta^3}{3}]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 H_D$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given wake half-height $H_D = 0.03c$ into the expression for $D$: $D = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 (0.03c) = 0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c$.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the drag coefficient. Use the definition $C_d = D / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c)$ to find the numerical value of $C_d$: $C_d = (0.01 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) / (0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2 c) = 0.01 / 0.5 = 0.02$.",
        "Step 8: Round the result. Round the final $C_d$ value to 3 decimal places, which gives $0.020$."
