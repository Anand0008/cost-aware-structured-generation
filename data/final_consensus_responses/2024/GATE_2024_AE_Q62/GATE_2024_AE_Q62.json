For an exponentially decaying amplitude, the response is proportional to $e^{\\Re(\\lambda) t}$. We want to find the time $t$ when the amplitude becomes half its initial value. So, we set $e^{\\Re(\\lambda) t} = 1/2$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: $\\Re(\\lambda) t = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$. Therefore, $t = \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{\\Re(\\lambda)}$. Substituting $\\Re(\\lambda) = -0.039$: $t = \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{-0.039} = \\frac{-0.693147}{-0.039} \\approx 17.7729$ s. Rounding off to 1 decimal place gives 17.8 s."

        "Step 3: Recall that for a linear system, the response amplitude due to this mode decays exponentially as $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\\sigma t}$, where $A_0$ is the initial amplitude.",
        "Step 4: Set up the condition for the amplitude to become half its initial magnitude: $A(t) = 0.5 A_0$. Thus, $0.5 A_0 = A_0 e^{-\\sigma t}$, which simplifies to $0.5 = e^{-\\sigma t}$.",
        "Step 5: Solve for $t$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides: $\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(e^{-\\sigma t})$. This simplifies to $\\ln(0.5) = -\\sigma t$, or $t = \\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{-\\sigma} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.5)}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\sigma}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the numerical values. We know $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\sigma = 0.039$ s$^{-1}$. So, $t = \\frac{0.693147}{0.039} \\approx 17.7729$ s.",
