      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the TRUE statements for a single-stage axial compressor under off-design conditions.\n\n**Option A Analysis:** \"Starting from design condition and keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)\"\n*   **Effect on Axial Velocity ($V_x$):** For a constant mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) and fixed flow area ($A$), the axial velocity $V_x$ remains relatively constant or slightly decreases due to increased density at higher compression ($\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$).\n*   **Effect on Velocity Triangle:** Increasing blade RPM increases blade speed ($U$). In the rotor inlet velocity triangle, the relative velocity $\\vec{w}$ is given by $\\vec{w} = \\vec{V} - \\vec{U}$. The relative flow angle $\\beta$ is given by $\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$. If $U$ increases while $V_x$ is constant or decreases, the term $(U - V_{\\theta})/V_x$ increases, leading to an increase in $\\beta$. An actual relative flow angle $\\beta$ greater than the design blade angle is *positive incidence*. This causes the flow to impinge on the pressure surface, leading to flow separation (stall). Therefore, Statement A is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option B Analysis:** \"Starting from design condition at the same blade RPM, if the mass flow rate is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)\"\n*   **Effect on Axial Velocity ($V_x$):** If mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) increases at constant RPM, the axial velocity $V_x$ must increase (as $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$).\n*   **Incidence Change:** With $U$ constant and $V_x$ increasing, the term $\\frac{U - V_{\\theta}}{V_x}$ decreases, leading to a decrease in $\\tan(\\beta)$, and thus a decrease in $\\beta$. An actual relative flow angle $\\beta$ that is less than the design blade angle is *negative incidence*. This causes the flow to impinge on the suction surface, leading to flow separation on the suction side. The statement claims *positive incidence*, which is incorrect. Therefore, Statement B is **FALSE**.\n\n**Option C Analysis:** \"Keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor may experience surge\"\n*   As established in Option A, increasing blade RPM at constant mass flow leads to positive incidence and flow separation (stalling) on the pressure surface. Stalling reduces pressure rise and efficiency. If this stall becomes severe and widespread, it can lead to compressor surge, which is a global aerodynamic instability characterized by flow reversal and large pressure oscillations. On a compressor map, increasing RPM at constant mass flow moves the operating point towards higher pressure ratios, potentially crossing the surge line. Therefore, Statement C is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option D Analysis:** \"At the same blade RPM, if the mass flow rate is increased, the compressor may experience surge\"\n*   As established in Option B, increasing mass flow rate at constant RPM leads to negative incidence. On a compressor map, increasing mass flow at constant RPM moves the operating point to the right, away from the surge line (which is at low mass flow rates) and towards the choke limit (high mass flow rates). Surge is associated with low mass flow and high pressure ratio, not increased mass flow. Therefore, Statement D is **FALSE**.\n\nHence, the correct options are A and C."

        "Understand the fundamental principles of axial compressor off-design operation, including velocity triangles, incidence angle, flow separation (stall), and surge. Recall that at design, velocity triangles are matched to blade angles for zero incidence.",
        "Recall the continuity equation $\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$ and the velocity triangle relation $\\vec{W} = \\vec{V} - \\vec{U}$ (or $\\vec{V} = \\vec{U} + \\vec{w}$). Understand that the relative flow angle $\\beta$ is determined by $U$, $V_x$, and $V_{\\theta}$, and incidence is the difference between actual $\\beta$ and blade angle.",
        "Analyze Option A: If RPM (and thus blade speed $U$) increases while mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is constant, the axial velocity $V_x$ tends to decrease (due to increased density from higher compression) or remain relatively constant. In the rotor inlet velocity triangle, an increase in $U$ (or decrease in $V_x$) causes the relative velocity vector to swing towards the pressure surface, leading to a positive incidence angle (actual relative flow angle greater than design blade angle). This can cause flow separation on the pressure side, making Statement A TRUE.",
        "Analyze Option B (Increased Mass Flow, Constant RPM). If mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) increases, and assuming area A is fixed, the axial velocity ($V_x$) must increase. With constant RPM (and thus constant blade speed $U$), the relative flow angle $\\beta$ will decrease, leading to a negative incidence angle ($\\beta < \\beta_{design}$). This causes flow separation on the suction surface. Since the statement claims positive incidence, Option B is FALSE.",
        "Analyze Option C (Increased RPM, Constant Mass Flow, Surge). Increasing RPM at constant mass flow leads to positive incidence and flow separation (stalling) in the early stages. This breakdown of pressure rise can potentially trigger surge, which is a severe global instability. Thus, Option C is TRUE.",
        "Analyze Option D (Increased Mass Flow, Constant RPM, Surge). Increasing mass flow at constant RPM leads to negative incidence and moves the operating point to a higher flow rate on the compressor characteristic. This typically moves the compressor away from the surge line (which occurs at low mass flow rates) and towards choke. Therefore, surge risk decreases, and Option D is FALSE.",

For constant mass flow ($\\dot{m} = \\rho A V_x$), this implies a decrease in axial velocity ($V_x$). With increased $U$ and decreased $V_x$, the relative velocity vector swings towards the suction side of the rotor blade, causing the relative flow angle ($\\beta$) to decrease. This results in a negative incidence angle ($\\beta_{actual} < \\beta_{blade}$), which can lead to flow separation on the suction side. Additionally, the increased pressure rise can push the compressor closer to the surge line.",

This requires careful design of the compressor, like in the CFM56 engine, to operate efficiently and reliably over a wide range of conditions.",
