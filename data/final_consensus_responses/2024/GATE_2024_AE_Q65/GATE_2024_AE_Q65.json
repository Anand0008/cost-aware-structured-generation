      "reasoning": "The problem states that the model is tested \"following the principles of dynamic similarity.\" For low-speed aerodynamic flows (like a car at 30 m/s), dynamic similarity primarily implies matching the Reynolds number (Re) and ensuring geometric similarity. When dynamic similarity is achieved, the dimensionless drag coefficient (C_D) for the model (C_Dm) is equal to that of the full-scale car (C_Df), i.e., C_Dm = C_Df.\n\nLet's denote full-scale parameters with subscript 'f' and model parameters with 'm'.\nGiven:\n1.  Scale factor: L_m/L_f = 1/3.\n2.  Fluid properties: Assuming the wind tunnel uses air at similar conditions as the full-scale environment, the density (ρ) and dynamic viscosity (μ) are approximately the same for both: ρ_m = ρ_f = ρ and μ_m = μ_f = μ.\n\nFrom geometric similarity, the reference area (A or S) scales with the square of the linear dimension:\nA_m = A_f (L_m/L_f)^2 = A_f (1/3)^2 = A_f/9.\n\nFrom dynamic similarity (Reynolds number matching):\nRe_m = Re_f  => (ρ_m V_m L_m) / μ_m = (ρ_f V_f L_f) / μ_f\nSince ρ and μ are the same, this simplifies to V_m L_m = V_f L_f.\nSubstituting L_m = L_f/3:\nV_m (L_f/3) = V_f L_f  => V_m = 3 V_f.\n\nThe drag force (D) is given by the formula: D = 0.5 ρ V^2 A C_D.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio D_f/D_m:\nD_f = 0.5 ρ_f V_f^2 A_f C_Df\nD_m = 0.5 ρ_m V_m^2 A_m C_Dm\n\nTaking the ratio:\nD_f/D_m = (0.5 ρ_f V_f^2 A_f C_Df) / (0.5 ρ_m V_m^2 A_m C_Dm)\n\nSubstitute ρ_f = ρ_m and C_Df = C_Dm:\nD_f/D_m = (V_f^2 A_f) / (V_m^2 A_m)\n\nNow substitute V_m = 3 V_f and A_m = A_f/9:\nD_f/D_m = (V_f^2 A_f) / ((3 V_f)^2 (A_f/9))\nD_f/D_m = (V_f^2 A_f) / (9 V_f^2 (A_f/9))\nD_f/D_m = (V_f^2 A_f) / (V_f^2 A_f) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio D/Dm is 1.0."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand Dynamic Similarity and Geometric Scaling. The problem specifies testing \"following the principles of dynamic similarity.\" For low-speed aerodynamic flows, this requires geometric similarity and matching the Reynolds number (Re) between the model and the full-scale car. Geometric similarity means the model is a scaled replica, so the length scale ratio L_m/L_f = 1/3.",
        "Step 2: Determine Area Scaling. From geometric similarity, the reference area (frontal area) scales with the square of the linear dimension: A_m/A_f = (L_m/L_f)^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.",
        "Step 3: Apply Reynolds Number Matching to find Model Velocity. Dynamic similarity requires matching the Reynolds number (Re) for both the model and the full-scale car: Re_m = Re_f. Assuming the same fluid (air) is used for both, the density (rho) and dynamic viscosity (mu) are constant. The Reynolds number formula is Re = (rho * V * L) / mu. Therefore, (rho * V_m * L_m) / mu = (rho * V_f * L_f) / mu, which simplifies to V_m * L_m = V_f * L_f. Substitute L_m = L_f/3: V_m (L_f/3) = V_f L_f. This implies V_m = 3 V_f. Given V_f = 30 m/s, then V_m = 3 * 30 = 90 m/s.",
        "Step 4: Formulate the Drag Equation and Drag Coefficient Equality. The aerodynamic drag force (D) is given by the drag equation: D = 0.5 * rho * V^2 * A * C_D. A crucial consequence of dynamic similarity is that the dimensionless drag coefficient (C_D) is the same for both the model and the full-scale object: C_D,m = C_D,f.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the Ratio of Drag Forces (D_f/D_m). Write the drag equations for both full-scale (D_f) and model (D_m): D_f = 0.5 * rho * V_f^2 * A_f * C_D,f and D_m = 0.5 * rho * V_m^2 * A_m * C_D,m. Form the ratio D_f/D_m and substitute the relationships derived: rho_f = rho_m = rho, C_D,f = C_D,m = C_D, V_m = 3 V_f, and A_m = A_f/9. The ratio becomes: D_f/D_m = (0.5 * rho * V_f^2 * A_f * C_D) / (0.5 * rho * (3 V_f)^2 * (A_f/9) * C_D) = (V_f^2 * A_f) / (9 V_f^2 * A_f/9) = (V_f^2 * A_f) / (V_f^2 * A_f) = 1.",
        "Step 6: State the Final Conclusion. The ratio D/D_m is 1.0. This means that under the specified dynamic similarity conditions (Reynolds number matching), the drag force measured on the model is equal to the drag force on the full-scale car."
