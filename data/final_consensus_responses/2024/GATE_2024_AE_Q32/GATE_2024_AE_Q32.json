      "reasoning": "Given Poisson's ratio $\\nu = 0.5$, the material is incompressible. For an incompressible material under linear elasticity, the volumetric strain ($\\epsilon_v$) is zero for any finite hydrostatic stress. This can be mathematically shown using the relationship between Young's Modulus (E), Bulk Modulus (K), and Poisson's Ratio ($\\nu$): $E = 3K(1 - 2\\nu)$. Substituting $\\nu = 0.5$ gives $E = 3K(1 - 2 \\times 0.5) \\implies E = 3K(0)$. Since Young's Modulus E is given as 2500 MPa (a finite, non-zero value), for this equation to hold, the Bulk Modulus (K) must be infinitely large ($K \\to \\infty$). The Bulk Modulus (K) is also defined as the ratio of hydrostatic stress ($\\sigma_{hydrostatic}$) to volumetric strain ($\\epsilon_v$): $K = \\frac{\\sigma_{hydrostatic}}{\\epsilon_v}$. With a finite hydrostatic stress of 10 MPa and an infinite Bulk Modulus, the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_v$ must be zero. Therefore, the percentage change in volume, calculated as $\\epsilon_v \\times 100 \\%$, is $0 \\times 100 \\% = 0 \\%$. This confirms that a material with Poisson's ratio of 0.5 experiences no change in volume under hydrostatic loading."

      "Fluid Mechanics": "Ideal fluids are considered incompressible, analogous to solids with $\\nu = 0.5$. The bulk modulus is a key property for fluids as well. The behavior of incompressible materials under hydrostatic stress is relevant to the study of fluid mechanics and the design of pressurized systems.",
      "Material Science": "Understanding how atomic bonding and microstructure influence elastic constants and Poisson's ratio.",
      "Solid Mechanics": "The concepts of stress, strain, and their relationships are fundamental to solid mechanics and are applied in this problem."
