      "reasoning": "Directional static stability, also known as weathercock stability, describes an aircraft's initial tendency to align its longitudinal axis with the relative wind after experiencing a sideslip (beta) disturbance. This tendency is due to the generation of a restoring yawing moment. Mathematically, this requires a positive derivative of the yawing moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle: C_n_beta = dC_n/dbeta > 0.\n\n*   **Option A: The airplane when disturbed in yaw, from an equilibrium state, will experience a restoring moment.** This is the fundamental definition of static stability. If an aircraft is directionally stable, a disturbance (like a sideslip, which causes yaw) will induce a moment that tries to bring the aircraft back to its original, undisturbed state (zero sideslip). Thus, Option A is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: The variation of yawing moment coefficient (Cn) with sideslip angle (beta) for the airplane will look like (Graph shown with positive slope).** The condition for positive directional static stability is that the derivative of the yawing moment coefficient (C_n) with respect to the sideslip angle (beta) must be positive, i.e., dC_n / d(beta) > 0 or C_n_beta > 0. The graph shown in the option depicts C_n increasing with beta, meaning it has a positive slope (C_n_beta > 0). This graph correctly represents a directionally stable aircraft. Thus, Option B is correct.\n\n*   **Option C: The airplane will always tend to point into the relative wind.** This is a direct consequence and a physical intuition for directional static stability. Like a weathercock or an arrow, a directionally stable aircraft will naturally turn its nose into the oncoming relative wind to eliminate any sideslip. This is the physical description of weathercock stability. Thus, Option C is correct.\n\n*   **Option D: The airplane when disturbed in yaw will return to equilibrium state in a finite amount of time after removing the disturbance.** This statement describes dynamic stability, not static stability. Static stability only concerns the *initial tendency* to return to equilibrium (i.e., whether a restoring moment is generated). Dynamic stability determines *how* the aircraft returns to equilibrium (e.g., oscillating or aperiodically, and in what time frame). A statically stable aircraft can still be dynamically unstable (e.g., spiral divergence), meaning it might not return to equilibrium or might do so in an oscillatory manner that diverges over time. Therefore, this option is incorrect for describing *static* stability alone."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the definition of directional static stability. Directional static stability (or weathercock stability) is the aircraft's initial tendency to return to its equilibrium side-slip angle (zero sideslip) after a disturbance in yaw (sideslip angle, \\beta). This means it tends to align its longitudinal axis with the relative wind.",
        "Step 2: Identify the mathematical condition for directional static stability. For an aircraft to be directionally statically stable, the derivative of the yawing moment coefficient (C_n) with respect to the sideslip angle (\\beta) must be positive, i.e., C_{n_{\\beta}} = \\frac{dC_n}{d\\beta} > 0.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Option A. A restoring moment after a yaw disturbance is the fundamental definition of static stability in yaw. Therefore, Option A is correct.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option B. The provided graph shows the yawing moment coefficient ($C_n$) increasing linearly with the sideslip angle ($\\beta$), indicating a positive slope ($C_{n_{\\beta}} = dC_n / d\\beta > 0$). This condition ($C_{n_{\\beta}} > 0$) is correct for positive directional static stability, as it ensures a restoring yawing moment. Thus, Option B is correct.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option C. The 'weathercock' analogy for directional stability implies that the aircraft will naturally tend to point its nose into the relative wind, thereby reducing the sideslip angle to zero. This behavior is characteristic of directional static stability. Thus, Option C is correct.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate Option D. The statement 'returning to equilibrium in a finite amount of time' describes dynamic stability, not static stability. Static stability only guarantees the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, not the time-dependent response. An aircraft can be statically stable but dynamically unstable. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.",
        "Step 7: Conclude that options A, B, and C are correct based on the definitions and conditions of directional static stability."
