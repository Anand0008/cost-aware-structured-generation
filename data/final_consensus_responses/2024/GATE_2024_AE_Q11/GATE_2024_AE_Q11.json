A homogeneous system is always consistent, meaning it always has at least the trivial solution ($x=0, y=0, z=0$). To determine if there are infinitely many solutions or only the trivial solution, we examine the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 3 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nCalculate the determinant of $A$:\n$$\\det(A) = 7 \\left( (-1)(-1) - (1)(-1) \\right) - (-3) \\left( (3)(-1) - (1)(1) \\right) + 1 \\left( (3)(-1) - (-1)(1) \\right)$$\n$$\\det(A) = 7(1 + 1) + 3(-3 - 1) + 1(-3 + 1)$$\n$$\\det(A) = 7(2) + 3(-4) + 1(-2)$$\n$$\\det(A) = 14 - 12 - 2$$\n$$\\det(A) = 0$$\n\nSince $\\det(A) = 0$, the rank of the coefficient matrix $A$ is less than the number of unknowns (which is 3). For a homogeneous system, if $\\det(A) = 0$ (or equivalently, if $\\text{rank}(A) < \\text{number of unknowns}$), the system has infinitely many solutions.

Recognize that the given system of linear equations (7x - 3y + z = 0, 3x - y + z = 0, x - y - z = 0) is a homogeneous system because all constant terms on the right-hand side are zero. Homogeneous systems always have at least the trivial solution (x=0, y=0, z=0).",
        "Step 2: Form the coefficient matrix. Write the coefficient matrix A from the given equations:\nA = [[7, -3, 1],\n     [3, -1, 1],\n     [1, -1, -1]]",

Compute the determinant of A to check for linear independence and the nature of solutions.\ndet(A) = 7((-1)(-1) - (1)(-1)) - (-3)(3(-1) - 1(1)) + 1(3(-1) - (-1)(1))\n       = 7(1 + 1) + 3(-3 - 1) + 1(-3 + 1)\n       = 7(2) + 3(-4) + 1(-2)\n       = 14 - 12 - 2\n       = 0",
        "Step 4: Interpret the determinant. Since det(A) = 0, the rows (and columns) of the matrix are linearly dependent. For a homogeneous system, a determinant of zero implies that there are infinitely many non-trivial solutions, in addition to the trivial solution.",
