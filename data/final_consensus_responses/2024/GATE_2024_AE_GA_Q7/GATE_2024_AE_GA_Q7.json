Calculate the volume of the cube:**\nThe surface area of the cube is equal to the area of the sheet. Let the side length of the cube be $a$.\n$6a^2 = A_{sheet} = 216 \\text{ cm}^2$\n$a^2 = \\frac{216}{6} = 36 \\text{ cm}^2$\n$a = \\sqrt{36} = 6 \\text{ cm}$\nThe volume of the cube is $V_{cube} = a^3 = (6 \\text{ cm})^3 = 216 \\text{ cm}^3$.\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of the cylindrical tube:**\nThe phrase \"The two longer edges of the sheet are joined together to create a cylindrical tube\" implies that the 54 cm dimension becomes the height of the cylinder, and the 4 cm dimension becomes the circumference of the base. This interpretation is necessary to match the given options.\nCircumference $C = 2\\pi r = 4 \\text{ cm}$\n$r = \\frac{4}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\text{ cm}$\nHeight $h = 54 \\text{ cm}$\nVolume of cylinder $V_{cyl} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^2 (54) = \\pi \\frac{4}{\\pi^2} (54) = \\frac{4 \\times 54}{\\pi} = \\frac{216}{\\pi} \\text{ cm}^3$.\n\n**3. Calculate the ratio of the volumes:**\nRatio = $\\frac{V_{cyl}}{V_{cube}} = \\frac{216/\\pi}{216} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}$.\n\nThis result matches option A."

        "description": "Instead of calculating the individual volumes, the ratio can be expressed directly in terms of the given dimensions of the rectangular sheet and the resulting cylinder. The ratio would be (\\pi * r^2 * h) / (s^3), where r is the radius of the cylinder and s is the side length of the cube.",
        "pros_cons": "This approach avoids the intermediate step of calculating the individual volumes, but requires recognizing the relationship between the dimensions. It may be more intuitive for some students."
