      "reasoning": "The calculation involves applying the definition of relative Mach number, the speed of sound, the velocity triangle at the inducer inlet (with no pre-whirl), and the relationship between static and stagnation temperatures. With no pre-whirl, the absolute inlet flow is axial. The blade angle of 45° and relative Mach number of 1.0 provide key relationships. Combining the velocity triangle geometry, definition of Mach number, and the relationship between stagnation and static temperature yields an equation for tip speed U1. Using standard air properties (R=287 J/kg·K, derived from γ=1.4 and Cp=1005 J/kg·K), the derived formula $U_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma R T_{01}}{\\gamma + 3}}$ yields a value of approximately 234.07 m/s, which rounds to 234 m/s."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the given conditions and assumptions. The problem specifies a centrifugal compressor inducer with a blade angle $\\beta_1 = 45^{\\circ}$ at the tip, a relative Mach number $M_{r1} = 1.0$, and a stagnation temperature $T_{01} = 300 \\text{ K}$. Assume $\\gamma = 1.4$ and neglect pre-whirl ($c_{t1} = 0$). The specific gas constant for air is $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg\\cdot K)}$.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the inlet velocity triangle. With no pre-whirl, the absolute tangential velocity $c_{t1} = 0$, meaning the absolute velocity $c_1$ is purely axial ($c_1 = c_{f1}$). From the velocity triangle, $\\tan \\beta_1 = \\frac{c_{f1}}{U_1}$. Given $\\beta_1 = 45^{\\circ}$, $\\tan 45^{\\circ} = 1$, which implies $c_{f1} = U_1$ (and thus $c_1 = U_1$). The tangential component of relative velocity is $U_1 - c_{t1} = U_1$.",
        "Step 3: Relate relative velocity to inducer tip speed. From the velocity triangle, the relative velocity $w_1$ (or $c_{r1}$) is related to $c_{f1}$ and $U_1$ by $w_1^2 = c_{f1}^2 + (U_1 - c_{t1})^2$. Since $c_{t1}=0$ and $c_{f1} = U_1$, we have $w_1^2 = U_1^2 + U_1^2 = 2 U_1^2$. Therefore, $w_1 = \\sqrt{2} U_1$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the relative Mach number definition. The relative Mach number is $M_{r1} = \\frac{w_1}{a_1}$, where $a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$ is the local speed of sound based on the static temperature $T_1$. Given $M_{r1} = 1.0$, it implies $w_1 = a_1$. So, $w_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$.",
        "Step 5: Express static temperature in terms of stagnation temperature. The absolute stagnation temperature $T_{01}$ is related to the static temperature $T_1$ and the absolute velocity $c_1$ by $T_{01} = T_1 + \\frac{c_1^2}{2 C_p}$. We know $c_1 = U_1$ (from Step 2) and $C_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$. Substituting these, $T_{01} = T_1 + \\frac{U_1^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}\\right)} = T_1 + \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2 \\gamma R}$. Rearranging for $T_1$: $T_1 = T_{01} - \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2 \\gamma R}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute and combine equations to solve for $U_1$. From Step 3 and Step 4, we have $\\sqrt{2} U_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$. Squaring both sides gives $2 U_1^2 = \\gamma R T_1$. Now substitute the expression for $T_1$ from Step 5: $2 U_1^2 = \\gamma R \\left(T_{01} - \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2 \\gamma R}\\right)$. Expand and rearrange: $2 U_1^2 = \\gamma R T_{01} - \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2}$. $2 U_1^2 + \\frac{(\\gamma - 1) U_1^2}{2} = \\gamma R T_{01}$. $U_1^2 \\left(2 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2}\\right) = \\gamma R T_{01}$. $U_1^2 \\left(\\frac{4 + \\gamma - 1}{2}\\right) = \\gamma R T_{01}$. $U_1^2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma + 3}{2}\\right) = \\gamma R T_{01}$. Finally, solve for $U_1^2$: $U_1^2 = \\frac{2 \\gamma R T_{01}}{\\gamma + 3}$.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of $U_1$. Substitute the given values: $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg\\cdot K)}$, $T_{01} = 300 \\text{ K}$. $U_1^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 1.4 \\times 287 \\times 300}{1.4 + 3} = \\frac{241080}{4.4} \\approx 54790.909$. $U_1 = \\sqrt{54790.909} \\approx 234.07 \\text{ m/s}$. Rounding to the nearest integer, $U_1 = 234 \\text{ m/s}$.",
