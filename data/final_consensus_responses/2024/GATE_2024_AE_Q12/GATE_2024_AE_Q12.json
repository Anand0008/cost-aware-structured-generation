      "reasoning": "The problem requires finding the distance traveled by a body before coming to rest, given its acceleration as a function of velocity: $a = -C_1 - C_2 v^2$. For rectilinear motion, the acceleration can be expressed as $a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$. Equating these, we get $v \\frac{dv}{dx} = -C_1 - C_2 v^2$. Rearranging to separate variables for integration yields $dx = \\frac{v}{-C_1 - C_2 v^2} dv$. Integrating both sides, with limits for distance from $0$ to $s$ and for velocity from initial $v_0$ to final $0$ (when the body comes to rest), leads to the solution $s = \\frac{1}{2C_2} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{C_2}{C_1} v_0^2\\right)$. This result matches option A."

        "Identify the given acceleration function $a = -C_1 - C_2v^2$ (where $C_1, C_2 > 0$) and the objective: find the distance $x$ traveled until the body comes to rest ($v=0$), starting from an initial velocity $v_0$.",
        "Use the kinematic identity $a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$ to relate acceleration, velocity, and displacement, as the goal is to find distance $x$ without involving time $t$ explicitly.",
        "Substitute the given acceleration function into the kinematic identity: $v \\frac{dv}{dx} = -C_1 - C_2v^2$. Then, separate the variables to prepare for integration: $dx = \\frac{v}{-C_1 - C_2v^2} dv$.",
        "Set up the definite integral. The body starts at $x=0$ with velocity $v_0$ and comes to rest ($v=0$) at a distance $S$. Integrate $dx$ from $0$ to $S$ and the velocity term from $v_0$ to $0$: $S = \\int_{0}^{S} dx = \\int_{v_0}^{0} \\frac{v}{-C_1 - C_2v^2} dv$.",
        "Perform a substitution for the velocity integral: Let $u = C_1 + C_2v^2$. Then $du = 2C_2v \\, dv$, so $v \\, dv = \\frac{du}{2C_2}$. The integration limits for $u$ become $u(v_0) = C_1 + C_2v_0^2$ and $u(0) = C_1$.",

Swap the integration limits to remove the negative sign: $S = \\frac{1}{2C_2} \\int_{C_1}^{C_1 + C_2 v_0^2} \\frac{1}{u} du$.",
        "Evaluate the definite integral: $S = \\frac{1}{2C_2} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{C_1}^{C_1 + C_2 v_0^2} = \\frac{1}{2C_2} [\\ln(C_1 + C_2 v_0^2) - \\ln C_1]$.",
