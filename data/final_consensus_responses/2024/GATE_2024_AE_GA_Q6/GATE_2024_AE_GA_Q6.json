      "reasoning": "The question requires filling in blanks with appropriate words to complete idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs, ensuring grammatical correctness and contextual meaning. Let's analyze each blank:\n\n*   **Blank (i): \"keep his head (i)\"**\n    *   The common idiom is \"keep one's head down,\" which means to stay focused, concentrate, or avoid drawing attention. In the context of batting, it implies focusing on the game and the ball, avoiding distractions. Therefore, 'down' is the most suitable word.\n\n*   **Blank (ii): \"heading (ii) to bat\"**\n    *   The phrasal verb \"heading out to bat\" is a standard expression in sports, particularly cricket, describing the action of a player moving from the dugout or pavilion onto the playing field to bat. While 'down' could also be used, 'out' is more commonly associated with moving onto a field of play.\n\n*   **Blank (iii): \"a head (iii) batting\"**\n    *   The idiom \"a head for something\" means having a natural aptitude, talent, or good understanding for that particular activity. Thus, \"a head for batting\" signifies Steve's natural talent or skill in batting.\n\n*   **Blank (iv): \"a cool head (iv) his shoulders\"**\n    *   The well-known idiom is \"a cool head on one's shoulders,\" which describes someone who is calm, sensible, and able to think clearly, especially under pressure. This quality is highly desirable for a batsman.\n\nConsidering these analyses, Option C provides the best fit for all four blanks:\n*   (i) **down**: \"keep his head down\"\n*   (ii) **out**: \"heading out to bat\"\n*   (iii) **for**: \"a head for batting\"\n*   (iv) **on**: \"a cool head on his shoulders\"\n\nThis combination forms a grammatically correct and contextually meaningful sentence."
