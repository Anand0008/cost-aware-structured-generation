      "reasoning": "In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model, an isothermal layer is characterized by a constant temperature (T) with increasing altitude. The variation of pressure and density in such a layer is governed by the hydrostatic equation ($dP = -\\rho g dh$) and the ideal gas law ($P = \\rho R T$). When temperature is constant, integrating these equations shows that both pressure and density decrease exponentially with increasing altitude. Specifically, the density relationship is given by $\\rho = \\rho_b e^{{-\\frac{{g_0}}{{RT_b}}(h - h_b)}}$ or similar forms, where $\\rho_b$ and $T_b$ are the density and temperature at the base of the layer, and $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The exponential term clearly indicates a decrease as altitude $h$ increases. Therefore, density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude in the isothermal layer."
