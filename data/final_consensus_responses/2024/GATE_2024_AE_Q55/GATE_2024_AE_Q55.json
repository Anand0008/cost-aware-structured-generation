Differentiating twice, we get ${\\ddot{x}(t)} = -\\omega^2 {X} \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the matrix equation of motion:\n$- \\omega^2 [M]{X} + [K]{X} = {0}$\n$([K] - \\omega^2[M]){X} = {0}$\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. For non-trivial solutions (i.e., for the system to actually vibrate), the determinant of the dynamic stiffness matrix $([K] - \\omega^2[M])$ must be zero:\n$\\det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the matrices:\n$\\det \\begin{bmatrix} (2k - m\\omega^2) & -k \\\\ -k & (2k - m\\omega^2) \\end{bmatrix} = 0$\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)(2k - m\\omega^2) - (-k)(-k) = 0$\n$(2k - m\\omega^2)^2 - k^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a difference of squares, $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$, where $a = (2k - m\\omega^2)$ and $b = k$:\n$((2k - m\\omega^2) - k) ((2k - m\\omega^2) + k) = 0$\n$(k - m\\omega^2)(3k - m\\omega^2) = 0$\n\nThis characteristic equation yields two possible values for $\\omega^2$:\n1. $k - m\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies m\\omega^2 = k \\implies \\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n   So, $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n2. $3k - m\\omega^2 = 0 \\implies m\\omega^2 = 3k \\implies \\omega^2 = \\frac{3k}{m}$\n   So, $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$\n\nThe question asks for the larger of the two natural frequencies. Comparing $\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$, the larger frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}}$.\n\nWe need to express this in the form $\\omega = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{3k}{m}} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the numerical value of $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha \\approx 1.73205$\n\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, $\\alpha = 1.73$."
