The general thrust equation for an air-breathing engine is: \n$T = \\dot{m}_a (1 + f) V_e - \\dot{m}_a V_{\\infty} + (p_e - p_{\\infty}) A_e$\n\nThe problem statement provides two crucial simplifications:\n1.  \"Assume the engine exit pressure is equal to the ambient pressure\" ($p_e = p_{\\infty}$). This means the pressure thrust term $(p_e - p_{\\infty}) A_e$ becomes zero.\n2.  \"the fuel-air ratio is negligible\" ($f \\approx 0$). This means $(1+f) \\approx 1$ and the mass flow rate of exhaust gases ($\\dot{m}_e$) can be approximated as the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$).\n\nWith these simplifications, the thrust equation reduces to:\n$T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$\n\nFirst, calculate the mass flow rate of air ($\\dot{m}_a$) entering the engine:\n$\\dot{m}_a = \\rho_{\\infty} V_{\\infty} A_i$\nGiven:\n$\\rho_{\\infty} = 1 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$V_{\\infty} = 250 \\text{ m/s}$\n$A_i = 1 \\text{ m}^2$\n$\\dot{m}_a = (1 \\text{ kg/m}^3) \\times (250 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1 \\text{ m}^2) = 250 \\text{ kg/s}$\n\nNext, substitute the calculated mass flow rate and the given velocities into the simplified thrust equation:\n$T = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_{\\infty})$\nGiven:\n$V_e = 550 \\text{ m/s}$\n$V_{\\infty} = 250 \\text{ m/s}$\n$T = (250 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (550 \\text{ m/s} - 250 \\text{ m/s})$\n$T = (250 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (300 \\text{ m/s})$\n$T = 75000 \\text{ N}$\n\nThis calculated value matches the correct answer."
