For all other $x$, $f(x)$ is defined by polynomial functions, which are continuous. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous for all real $x$. Statement A is correct, and statement D is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Differentiability at $x=0$ and continuity of $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:**\n    First, find the derivative for $x \\ne 0$:\n    *   For $x < 0$, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1$.\n\n    Now, check the one-sided derivatives at $x=0$:\n    *   Left-hand derivative: $f'_-(0) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^-} \\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^-} \\frac{h^2-0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^-} h = 0$.\n    *   Right-hand derivative: $f'_+(0) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+} \\frac{h-0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+} 1 = 1$.\n    Since $f'_-(0) \\ne f'_+(0)$, the function $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. Consequently, the derivative function $f'(x)$ (defined as $f'(x)=2x$ for $x<0$ and $f'(x)=1$ for $x>0$) has a jump discontinuity at $x=0$ (left limit is 0, right limit is 1). Therefore, statement B is correct.\n\n3.  **Continuity of $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:**\n    For $x=1$, we are in the region $x > 0$, where $f(x) = x$. The derivative in this region is $f'(x) = 1$. Since $f'(x)$ is a constant function (1) for $x > 0$, it is continuous at $x=1$. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A, B, and C are correct."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define the given piecewise function $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2 & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ x & \\text{for } x \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$.",
        "Step 2: Check the continuity of $f(x)$ at the transition point $x=0$. Evaluate $f(0)$: $f(0) = 0$. Compute the left-hand limit (LHL): $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} x^2 = 0^2 = 0$. Compute the right-hand limit (RHL): $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x = 0$. Since $f(0) = \\text{LHL} = \\text{RHL} = 0$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$. For $x < 0$, $f(x) = x^2$ (polynomial, continuous). For $x > 0$, $f(x) = x$ (polynomial, continuous). Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous for all real values of $x$ (Statement A is true, D is false).",
        "Step 3: Check differentiability of $f(x)$ at $x=0$. Compute the left-hand derivative (LHD): $f'_{-}(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{(0+h)^2 - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} h = 0$. Compute the right-hand derivative (RHD): $f'_{+}(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{(0+h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1$. Since $f'_{-}(0) \\ne f'_{+}(0)$, the function $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.",
        "Step 4: Determine the derivative function $f'(x)$. For $x < 0$, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$. For $x > 0$, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1$. At $x=0$, $f'(x)$ does not exist (as shown in Step 3). So, $f'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } x > 0 \\end{cases}$.",
        "Step 5: Check the continuity of $f'(x)$ at $x=0$. Left-hand limit of $f'(x)$ as $x \\to 0^-$: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} 2x = 0$. Right-hand limit of $f'(x)$ as $x \\to 0^+$: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} 1 = 1$. Since $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) \\ne \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x)$, the derivative function $f'(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$ (Statement B is true).",
        "Step 6: Check the continuity of $f'(x)$ at $x=1$. For $x > 0$, $f'(x) = 1$. This is a constant function, which is continuous everywhere in its domain. Therefore, $f'(x)$ is continuous at $x=1$ (Statement C is true).",
        "Step 7: Summarize the findings. $f(x)$ is continuous for all real $x$. (Statement A is true, D is false). $f'(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$. (Statement B is true). $f'(x)$ is continuous at $x=1$. (Statement C is true).",
