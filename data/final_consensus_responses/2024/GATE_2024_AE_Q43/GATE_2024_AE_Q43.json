The wedge angle is constant for all three cases.\n\n1.  **Detached Shock ($M_3$)**: A detached bow shock forms when the flow deflection angle (wedge angle) is too large for an attached oblique shock to form at the given upstream Mach number. This condition, where $\\theta > \\theta_{max}$, typically occurs at *lower* Mach numbers for a fixed wedge angle. Therefore, $M_3$ represents the lowest Mach number among the three.\n\n2.  **Attached Oblique Shocks ($M_1, M_2$)**: For a given wedge angle ($\\theta$) and considering only weak shock solutions, the shock wave angle ($\\beta$) *decreases* as the upstream Mach number ($M$) *increases*.\n    *   From the figure, the shock for $M_1$ has a visibly *larger* shock angle ($\\beta_1$) compared to the shock for $M_2$ ($\\beta_2$).\n    *   Since $\\beta_1 > \\beta_2$ for the same wedge angle and weak shock solutions, it implies that $M_1 < M_2$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Combining these observations, $M_3$ is the lowest, and $M_1$ is less than $M_2$. Thus, the correct order is $M_3 < M_1 < M_2$."

        "Identify the given conditions: a fixed wedge angle ($\\theta$) for all three cases, and the requirement to consider only weak shock solutions for attached oblique shocks.",
        "Analyze the detached shock case ($M_3$): A detached bow shock forms when the flow deflection angle (wedge angle) exceeds the maximum possible deflection angle ($\\theta_{max}$) for an attached oblique shock at that Mach number. This condition occurs at lower Mach numbers for a fixed wedge angle, implying $M_3$ is the lowest Mach number.",
        "Step 3: Identify the detached shock case. For a given wedge angle, a detached bow shock (as seen in $M_3$) occurs when the upstream Mach number is below a critical value, or when the wedge angle exceeds the maximum deflection angle for that Mach number. This implies that $M_3$ is the lowest Mach number among the three cases.",
        "Step 4: For attached weak oblique shocks (cases $M_1$ and $M_2$), the relationship between the upstream Mach number ($M$) and the shock wave angle ($\\beta$) for a fixed wedge angle ($\\theta$) is inverse: as $M$ increases, $\\beta$ decreases (the shock becomes less steep).",
        "Step 5: Visually compare the shock angles for $M_1$ and $M_2$. The shock angle for $M_1$ ($\\beta_1$) is visibly larger than the shock angle for $M_2$ ($\\beta_2$). Based on the trend identified in Step 4 (smaller $\\beta$ means higher $M$), it follows that $M_1 < M_2$.",
        "Step 6: Combining the conclusions from Step 3 ($M_3$ is the lowest Mach number) and Step 5 ($M_1 < M_2$), the overall order of the Mach numbers is $M_3 < M_1 < M_2$."
