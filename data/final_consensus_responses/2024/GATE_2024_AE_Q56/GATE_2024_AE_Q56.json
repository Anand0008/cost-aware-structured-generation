        "Step 1: Recall the 2D strain compatibility condition.

        "Step 2: Write down the given functions: $\\epsilon_{xx} = 10xy^2$, $\\epsilon_{yy} = -5x^2y$, $\\gamma_{xy} = Axy(2x - y)$.",
        "Step 3: Compute the second partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2}$. First derivative: $\\frac{\\partial\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y} = 20xy$. Second derivative: $\\frac{\\partial^2\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = 20x$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the second partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2}$. First derivative: $\\frac{\\partial\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x} = -10xy$. Second derivative: $\\frac{\\partial^2\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = -10y$.",
        "Step 5: Compute the mixed partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x\\partial y}$. First, rewrite $\\gamma_{xy} = A(2x^2y - xy^2)$. Compute $\\frac{\\partial\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x} = A(4xy - y^2)$. Then compute $\\frac{\\partial^2\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} [A(4xy - y^2)] = A(4x - 2y)$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute all derivatives into the compatibility equation: $20x + (-10y) = A(4x - 2y) \\Rightarrow 20x - 10y = A(4x - 2y)$.",
        "Step 7: For this equation to hold for all independent x and y, the coefficients of x and y on both sides must match separately. For the x terms: $20 = 4A \\Rightarrow A = 5$. For the y terms: $-10 = -2A \\Rightarrow A = 5$. Both conditions are consistent, giving A = 5.0.",
