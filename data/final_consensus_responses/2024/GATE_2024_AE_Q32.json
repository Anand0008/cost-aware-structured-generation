      "reasoning": "For an isotropic, linear elastic material, a Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$) of 0.5 signifies an incompressible material. The volumetric strain ($\\epsilon_v$) under hydrostatic stress ($\\sigma_h$) is given by the formula $\\epsilon_v = \\frac{\\sigma_h (1-2\\nu)}{E}$. When $\\nu = 0.5$, the term $(1-2\\nu)$ becomes $(1 - 2 \\times 0.5) = (1 - 1) = 0$. Therefore, $\\epsilon_v = 0$, regardless of the values of hydrostatic stress or Young's modulus. A zero volumetric strain means there is no change in volume, hence the percentage change in volume is 0%."
