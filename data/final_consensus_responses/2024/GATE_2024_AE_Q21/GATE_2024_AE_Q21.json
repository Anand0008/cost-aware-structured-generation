      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the statement that is NOT true regarding the stagnation point of a uniform flow superposed with a source.\n\n1.  **Define the flow field:** For a uniform flow with speed U along the positive x-axis and a source of strength Λ at the origin, the velocity components in polar coordinates are:\n    $V_r = U \\cos\\theta + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}$\n    $V_\\theta = -U \\sin\\theta$\n\n2.  **Find stagnation points:** Stagnation points occur where both velocity components are zero ($V_r = 0$ and $V_\\theta = 0$).\n    From $V_\\theta = -U \\sin\\theta = 0$: Since $U \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sin\\theta = 0$, which implies $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$.\n    Substitute these into $V_r = 0$:\n    -   For $\\theta = 0$: $U \\cos(0) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\Rightarrow U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\Rightarrow r = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. This is non-physical as radial distance $r$ must be positive.\n    -   For $\\theta = \\pi$: $U \\cos(\\pi) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\Rightarrow -U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\Rightarrow r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. This is a physical solution since $\\Lambda$ and $U$ are positive, so $r > 0$.\n\n3.  **Location of stagnation point:** The stagnation point is located at $(r, \\theta) = \\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, \\pi\\right)$. In Cartesian coordinates, this corresponds to $(x, y) = \\left(-\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, 0\\right)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A. It is located to the left of the origin:** True. The x-coordinate is negative ($-\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$), placing it on the negative x-axis, to the left of the origin. This is consistent with $\\theta = \\pi$.\n    *   **B. It moves closer to the origin for increasing Λ, while U is held constant:** False. The distance from the origin is $r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. If $\\Lambda$ increases (and U is constant), the value of $r$ increases, meaning the stagnation point moves *further away* from the origin.\n    *   **C. It moves closer to the origin for increasing U, while Λ is held constant:** True. The distance from the origin is $r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}$. If U increases (and $\\Lambda$ is constant), the denominator increases, causing $r$ to decrease. A decreased $r$ means the stagnation point moves closer to the origin.\n    *   **D. It is located along the x-axis:** True. The y-coordinate is 0 (or $\\theta = \\pi$), meaning it lies on the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, statement B is NOT true, making it the correct answer."

        "Step 2: Recall the velocity components for this combined flow in polar coordinates. The radial velocity component is V_r = U\\cos\\theta + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}, and the tangential velocity component is V_\\theta = -U\\sin\\theta.",
        "Step 3: Identify the condition for a stagnation point. A stagnation point is where the local fluid velocity is zero, meaning both V_r = 0 and V_\\theta = 0 simultaneously.",
        "Step 4: Solve for the angular location of the stagnation point. Set V_\\theta = 0: -U\\sin\\theta = 0. Since U ≠ 0, this implies \\sin\\theta = 0, which gives \\theta = 0 or \\theta = \\pi.",
        "Step 5: Solve for the radial location of the stagnation point. Substitute the possible \\theta values into V_r = 0.\n    If \\theta = 0: V_r = U\\cos(0) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\implies r = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}. This is physically impossible as radial distance r must be positive.\n    If \\theta = \\pi: V_r = U\\cos(\\pi) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = -U + \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r} = 0 \\implies U = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi r}. Solving for r, we get r = \\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}.",
        "Step 6: State the stagnation point location. The stagnation point is located at (r, \\theta) = (\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, \\pi). In Cartesian coordinates, this corresponds to (x, y) = (-\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}, 0).",
        "Step 7: Evaluate each given statement based on the stagnation point location x = -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\pi U}:\n    A. \"It is located to the left of the origin\": True, as x is negative.\n    B. \"It moves closer to the origin for increasing \\Lambda, while U is held constant\": False.
