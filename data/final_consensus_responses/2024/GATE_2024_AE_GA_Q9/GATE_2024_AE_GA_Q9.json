      "reasoning": "The initial dimensions of the rectangular paper are 20 cm (long edge) x 8 cm (short edge). The folding process is as follows:\n\n1.  **First fold:** The fold is made along the line of symmetry perpendicular to the long edge (20 cm). This means the 20 cm side is halved, while the 8 cm side remains unchanged. The new dimensions become $20 \\text{ cm} / 2 = 10 \\text{ cm}$ and $8 \\text{ cm}$. So, the sheet is now 10 cm x 8 cm.\n\n2.  **Second fold:** The fold is again made along the line of symmetry perpendicular to its *current* long edge. The current long edge is 10 cm. This side is halved, and the 8 cm side remains unchanged. The new dimensions become $10 \\text{ cm} / 2 = 5 \\text{ cm}$ and $8 \\text{ cm}$. So, the sheet is now 5 cm x 8 cm.\n\n3.  **Third fold:** The fold is once more made along the line of symmetry perpendicular to its *current* long edge. The current long edge is 8 cm. This side is halved, and the 5 cm side remains unchanged. The new dimensions become $5 \\text{ cm}$ and $8 \\text{ cm} / 2 = 4 \\text{ cm}$. So, the final folded sheet is 5 cm x 4 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the final folded sheet is calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2 \\times (length + width)$.\n$P = 2 \\times (5 \\text{ cm} + 4 \\text{ cm})$\n$P = 2 \\times (9 \\text{ cm})$\n$P = 18 \\text{ cm}$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 18 cm, which corresponds to option A."
