      "reasoning": "The given function `y = e^{px} \\sin qx` is a standard form of a solution to a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. Specifically, if the characteristic equation of such an ODE has complex conjugate roots `m = p \\pm iq`, then the general solution is of the form `y = e^{px}(C_1 \\cos qx + C_2 \\sin qx)`. The differential expression provided, `d^2y/dx^2 - 2p dy/dx + (p^2 + q^2)y`, corresponds exactly to the differential operator `(D^2 - 2pD + (p^2 + q^2))` where `D = d/dx`. This operator is derived from the characteristic equation `m^2 - 2pm + (p^2 + q^2) = 0`, whose roots are `m = p \\pm iq`. Since `y = e^{px} \\sin qx` is a solution to this homogeneous differential equation, applying the corresponding differential operator to `y` must yield zero. Direct differentiation confirms this:\n\n1.  Given `y = e^{px} \\sin qx`\n2.  Calculate `dy/dx` using the product rule:\n    `\\frac{dy}{dx} = p e^{px} \\sin qx + q e^{px} \\cos qx = e^{px}(p \\sin qx + q \\cos qx)`\n3.  Calculate `d^2y/dx^2` using the product rule again:\n    `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = p e^{px}(p \\sin qx + q \\cos qx) + e^{px}(p q \\cos qx - q^2 \\sin qx)`\n    `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{px}(p^2 \\sin qx + pq \\cos qx + pq \\cos qx - q^2 \\sin qx)`\n    `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{px}((p^2 - q^2) \\sin qx + 2pq \\cos qx)`\n4.  Substitute `y`, `dy/dx`, and `d^2y/dx^2` into the given expression:\n    `\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - 2p \\frac{dy}{dx} + (p^2 + q^2)y`\n    `= e^{px}((p^2 - q^2) \\sin qx + 2pq \\cos qx)`\n    `- 2p [e^{px}(p \\sin qx + q \\cos qx)]`\n    `+ (p^2 + q^2) [e^{px} \\sin qx]`\n5.  Factor out `e^{px}` and group terms:\n    `= e^{px} [ (p^2 - q^2) \\sin qx + 2pq \\cos qx - 2p^2 \\sin qx - 2pq \\cos qx + (p^2 + q^2) \\sin qx ]`\n6.  Combine coefficients for `\\sin qx` and `\\cos qx`:\n    `= e^{px} [ (p^2 - q^2 - 2p^2 + p^2 + q^2) \\sin qx + (2pq - 2pq) \\cos qx ]`\n    `= e^{px} [ (2p^2 - 2p^2 - q^2 + q^2) \\sin qx + (0) \\cos qx ]`\n    `= e^{px} [ 0 \\cdot \\sin qx + 0 \\cdot \\cos qx ]`\n    `= 0`\n\nThus, the value of the differential expression is 0."
