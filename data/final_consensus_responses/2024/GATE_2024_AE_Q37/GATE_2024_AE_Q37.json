      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the volume of a solid generated by rotating a shaded portion of a circle about the y-axis. The image shows a circle of radius R centered at the origin. The shaded portion is a circular segment. The angle given (60 degrees) is between the positive y-axis and the radius to the point where the horizontal line (forming the base of the segment) intersects the circle in the first quadrant. This implies the horizontal line is at y = R cos(60°) = R/2. The solid is formed by rotating the region bounded by x = ±√(R^2 - y^2) and y = R/2 to y = R about the y-axis. Using the disk method for volume of revolution, V = ∫(y_1 to y_2) πx^2 dy. Substituting x^2 = R^2 - y^2 and the limits of integration from y = R/2 to y = R, we get V = π ∫(R/2 to R) (R^2 - y^2) dy. Evaluating this integral yields V = (5/24) π R^3. Comparing this with the given form k π R^3, we find k = 5/24."

        "Step 1: Understand the geometry of the shaded region. The image shows a circle of radius R centered at the origin. The shaded portion is a circular segment above a horizontal line.

This implies the horizontal line is at y = R cos(60°).",
        "Determine the equation of the horizontal line. Since \\cos(60^\\circ) = 1/2, the horizontal line is $y = R/2$. The shaded region is bounded by this line and the upper arc of the circle.",
        "Identify the equation of the circle. The equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius $R$ is $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. When rotating about the y-axis, we need $x^2$ in terms of $y$, so $x^2 = R^2 - y^2$.",
        "Choose a method for calculating the volume of revolution. The disk method is suitable here since we are rotating about the y-axis and the function is easily expressed as $x^2 = f(y)$. The formula for the disk method is $V = \\int_{y_1}^{y_2} \\pi x^2 dy$.",
        "Set up the integral. The limits of integration for $y$ are from the horizontal line $y = R/2$ to the top of the circle $y = R$. So, $V = \\int_{R/2}^{R} \\pi (R^2 - y^2) dy$.",
