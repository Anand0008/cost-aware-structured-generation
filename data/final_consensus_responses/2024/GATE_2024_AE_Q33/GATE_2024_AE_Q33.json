      "reasoning": "The question defines 'landing vertical load factor' as the ratio of inertial load to weight. However, the provided answer key (1.5) and standard aerospace engineering references define the vertical load factor during landing as n_z = R_z / W, where R_z is the net vertical ground reaction. Using this standard definition: n_z = 15000 N / 10000 N = 1.5. The phrase 'inertial load' is interpreted as the ground reaction force that balances inertia, aligning with the standard definition of load factor as the ratio of the total vertical ground reaction force to the aircraft's weight. This interpretation matches the RAG context and the answer key, resolving the potential ambiguity in the question's explicit definition."

The load factor $n_z$ is commonly defined as $n_z = 1 + \\frac{a_z}{g}$. Substituting $a_z = (n_z - 1)g$ into the force balance: $R_z - W = m \\cdot (n_z - 1)g = \\frac{W}{g} \\cdot (n_z - 1)g = W(n_z - 1)$. Rearranging yields $R_z = W + W(n_z - 1) = Wn_z$. Thus, $n_z = \\frac{R_z}{W}$. It's important to note that while $m \\cdot a_z$ represents the inertial load, the standard aerospace definition of load factor ($n_z$) is the ratio of the total apparent force (ground reaction) to the aircraft's weight, not just the inertial component divided by weight.",

Cons: Can be more mathematically involved; takes longer than direct formula application; if not carefully applied, focusing solely on inertial load (m*az/W) can lead to confusion or an incorrect value for the standard aerospace load factor (Rz/W).",
