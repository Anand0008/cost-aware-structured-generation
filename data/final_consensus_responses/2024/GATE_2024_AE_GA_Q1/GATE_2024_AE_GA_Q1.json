      "reasoning": "The analogy is based on an increasing order of intensity. The sequence 'dry → arid → parched' progresses from a general lack of moisture ('dry') to very dry conditions ('arid') and finally to extreme dryness ('parched'). Similarly, the sequence 'diet → fast → ________' must follow an increasing intensity of food restriction. 'Diet' involves controlled food intake, 'fast' means abstaining from food for a period, which is more intense. Therefore, 'starve' is the appropriate word to fill the blank, as it signifies suffering or dying from extreme lack of food, representing the highest intensity of food deprivation. Options such as 'reject', 'feast', or 'deny' do not maintain this logical progression of increasing intensity."

        "Identify the core relationship in the first set of words. Analyze `[dry → arid → parched]`. Observe that the words denote an increasing degree or intensity of 'dryness', with 'parched' being the most extreme.",

        "Apply this identified relationship (increasing intensity) to the second set of words: `[diet → fast → ________ ]`.",
        "Understand the specific meanings of the given words in the second set: 'diet' (a regulated course of food, often for health or weight management), 'fast' (to abstain from all or some kinds of food or drink). This sequence indicates an increasing intensity of food restriction or deprivation.",
        "Evaluate the given options to find the word that continues this pattern of increasing intensity:",
        "- A. 'starve': To suffer or die from hunger. This represents the highest intensity of food deprivation, analogous to 'parched' for dryness.",
        "- B. 'reject': To dismiss or refuse. This is not related to the intensity of food deprivation.",
        "- C. 'feast': A large, elaborate meal. This is the opposite of food deprivation.",
        "- D. 'deny': To refuse to grant or acknowledge. This is not related to the intensity of food deprivation.",
        "Conclude that 'starve' is the most appropriate word to fill the blank, as it maintains the increasing order of intensity of food deprivation."
