      "reasoning": "A geostationary orbit (GEO) is a specific type of geosynchronous orbit characterized by three strict conditions:\n1.  **Orbital plane coincides with Earth's equatorial plane (0° inclination).** This means the orbit lies directly above the Earth's equator, which is essential for the satellite to appear stationary from Earth's surface. Therefore, statement A is correct.\n2.  **The orbit is circular (zero eccentricity) about the center of the Earth.** A circular orbit ensures a constant orbital speed and radius, allowing the satellite to remain fixed relative to a point on the Earth's surface. Therefore, statement B is correct.\n3.  **Orbital period equals Earth's sidereal rotation period.** This period is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds (or roughly 24 hours for practical purposes), matching the Earth's rotation.\n\n*   **Option C: The time period of motion is 90 minutes.** This is incorrect. A 90-minute orbital period is characteristic of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), not a geostationary orbit.\n*   **Option D: The satellite is visible from all parts of the Earth.** This is incorrect. Geostationary satellites provide continuous coverage to a large fixed area, but their coverage is limited. They cannot cover the polar regions or areas at very high latitudes. A single geostationary satellite is only visible from about 42% of Earth's surface (latitudes within approximately ±81°), with extreme polar regions having no line of sight. A network of at least three such satellites is needed for near-global coverage (excluding polar regions)."

        "Understand the definition of a geostationary orbit: It is a special type of geosynchronous orbit where the satellite appears stationary from a fixed point on the Earth's surface.",
        "Recall the key characteristics required for a geostationary orbit: The orbit must be circular (zero eccentricity), lie in the equatorial plane (0 degrees inclination), and have an orbital period matching Earth's sidereal rotation period (approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds).",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'The orbit lies in the equatorial plane.' This is a fundamental requirement (0 degrees inclination) for a geostationary orbit to maintain a fixed position relative to Earth's surface. Thus, statement A is correct.",
        "Evaluate Option B: 'The orbit is circular about the center of the Earth.' A circular orbit (zero eccentricity) is essential for a geostationary satellite to maintain a constant altitude and speed, appearing stationary. Thus, statement B is correct.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'The time period of motion is 90 minutes.' This is incorrect. The orbital period for a geostationary orbit is one sidereal day (approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds), not 90 minutes. 90 minutes is typical for a Low Earth Orbit (LEO).",
        "Evaluate Option D: 'The satellite is visible from all parts of the Earth.' This is incorrect. A single geostationary satellite can only cover approximately 42% of the Earth's surface and cannot cover the polar regions. Multiple satellites are needed for near-global coverage.",
