      "reasoning": "The question asks for the moles of dry air required for the stoichiometric combustion of 1 mole of C10H12. The general stoichiometric combustion equation for a hydrocarbon C_x H_y with dry air (approximated as 1 mole O2 for 3.76 moles N2) is:\nC_x H_y + a(O_2 + 3.76 N_2) \\rightarrow xCO_2 + (y/2)H_2O + 3.76a N_2\n\nFor C10H12, we have x = 10 and y = 12.\n\n1.  **Balance Oxygen atoms to find 'a' (moles of O2 required):**\n    The coefficient 'a' can be found using the formula a = x + y/4.\n    Substitute x = 10 and y = 12:\n    a = 10 + 12/4\n    a = 10 + 3\n    a = 13 moles of O2\n\n2.  **Calculate total moles of dry air:**\n    Dry air is composed of 21% O2 and 79% N2 by volume (or mole fraction). This means for every 1 mole of O2, there are 79/21 \\approx 3.76 moles of N2. \n    Therefore, 1 mole of O2 is accompanied by 3.76 moles of N2, making a total of 1 + 3.76 = 4.76 moles of dry air per mole of O2.\n\n    Since a = 13 moles of O2 are required, the total moles of dry air needed are:\n    Moles of dry air = a \\times (1 + 3.76)\n    Moles of dry air = 13 \\times 4.76\n    Moles of dry air = 61.88\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the answer is 61.9 moles of dry air. This matches option A."

        "Step 1: Identify the fuel as C10H12 (implying x=10, y=12) and the composition of dry air (21% O2, 79% N2 by volume, which means for every mole of O2, there are 3.76 moles of N2).",
        "Step 2: Write the general stoichiometric combustion equation for a hydrocarbon C_x H_y with dry air: C_x H_y + a(O_2 + 3.76 N_2) \\rightarrow xCO_2 + (y/2)H_2O + 3.76a N_2.",
        "Step 3: Balance the oxygen atoms in the combustion equation. The oxygen on the reactant side is 2a (from aO_2). The oxygen on the product side is 2x (from xCO_2) plus y/2 (from (y/2)H_2O). Thus, 2a = 2x + y/2.",
        "Step 4: Simplify the oxygen balance equation to find 'a': a = x + y/4. Substitute x=10 and y=12 into this equation: a = 10 + 12/4 = 10 + 3 = 13.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the total moles of dry air required per mole of fuel. Since dry air is approximated as O_2 + 3.76 N_2, 1 mole of O_2 corresponds to 1 + 3.76 = 4.76 moles of dry air. Therefore, total moles of dry air = a \\times 4.76 = 13 \\times 4.76 = 61.88 \\approx 61.9 moles of dry air per mole of fuel."
