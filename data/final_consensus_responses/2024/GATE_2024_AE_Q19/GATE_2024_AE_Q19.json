        "Identify the governing principle and given parameters. For a combustor with negligible kinetic energy changes and 100% burner efficiency, the steady-flow energy balance (First Law of Thermodynamics) applies. Given parameters are: combustor inlet temperature ($T_{t3} = 600$ K), combustor exit temperature ($T_{t4} = 1300$ K), specific heat ($C_p = 1100$ J/(kg K)), heating value of the fuel ($Q_R = 43.4 \\times 10^6$ J/kg), and burner efficiency ($\\eta_b = 1.0$). Note the critical assumption $f << 1.0$.",
        "Recall the energy balance principle for a combustor. For a steady-flow combustor, the energy released by burning fuel increases the enthalpy of the air. The general energy balance is $\\dot{m}_a C_p T_{t3} + \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_p T_{t4}$. Given the assumption $f << 1.0$, the mass of fuel added is considered negligible compared to the air mass flow rate for the enthalpy change of the gas mixture. This simplifies the energy balance to: $\\dot{m}_a C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) = \\dot{m}_f Q_R \\eta_b$.",
        "Define the fuel-air ratio as $f = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a}$. Rearrange the simplified energy balance equation to solve for $f$: Divide both sides by $\\dot{m}_a$ to get $C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3}) = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{\\dot{m}_a} Q_R \\eta_b$, which simplifies to $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{t4} - T_{t3})}{Q_R \\eta_b}$.",
        "Extract given data from the problem statement. $T_{t3}=600\\,\\text{K}$, $T_{t4}=1300\\,\\text{K}$, $Q_R=43.4\\times10^6\\,\\text{J/kg}$, $C_p=1100\\,\\text{J/kg K}$, $\\eta_b=1$.",
        "Perform the calculation. Compute temperature rise: $\\Delta T = T_{t4} - T_{t3} = 1300 - 600 = 700\\,\\text{K}$. Substitute the numerical values into the derived formula: $f = \\frac{1100 \\times 700}{43.4 \\times 10^6 \\times 1} = \\frac{770,000}{43,400,000} \\approx 0.0177419$.",
