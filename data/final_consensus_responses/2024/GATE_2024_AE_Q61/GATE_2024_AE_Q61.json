      "reasoning": "The question asks for the ratio of equivalent airspeed (EAS) to true airspeed (TAS). The fundamental relationship between EAS and TAS is derived from the equality of dynamic pressure at flight conditions and at standard sea level conditions. The formula is: $V_{EAS}/V_{TAS} = \\sqrt{\\rho_{alt} / \\rho_{SL}}$. The given Mach number (0.2) is irrelevant for this specific ratio calculation as it cancels out. Using the given densities: $\\rho_{alt} = 0.819 \\text{ kg/m}^3$ and $\\rho_{SL} = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, the calculation is: $\\frac{V_{EAS}}{V_{TAS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.819}{1.225}} = \\sqrt{0.66857...} \\approx 0.8177$. Rounded off to 2 decimal places, the ratio is $0.82$. This value is consistent with typical answer ranges for such problems."

        "Step 2: Recall the fundamental definition linking EAS and TAS. Equivalent Airspeed is defined as the speed at sea level that would produce the same dynamic pressure as the True Airspeed at the actual altitude. The governing principle is dynamic pressure equality: $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{alt} V_{TAS}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{SL} V_{EAS}^2$.",
        "Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for the required ratio. Cancel the common factor $\\frac{1}{2}$. The equation becomes $\\rho_{alt} V_{TAS}^2 = \\rho_{SL} V_{EAS}^2$. Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{V_{EAS}}{V_{TAS}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho_{alt}}{\\rho_{SL}}$.",
        "Step 4: Take the square root to obtain the ratio: $\\frac{V_{EAS}}{V_{TAS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{alt}}{\\rho_{SL}}}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given numerical values: $\\frac{V_{EAS}}{V_{TAS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.819}{1.225}}$.",
        "Step 6: Perform the arithmetic. $\\frac{0.819}{1.225} = 0.668571...$. $\\sqrt{0.668571} \\approx 0.81766$.",
        "Step 7: Round off to two decimal places as requested: 0.82."
