Total fat percentage = 20% + 20% + 5% = 45%.\n2.  **Calculate total calories from fat:** The total diet is 2,000 kcal. Calories from fat = 45% of 2,000 kcal = 0.45 × 2,000 kcal = 900 kcal.\n3.  **Identify energy density of fat:** From the table, the energy density for all types of fat (Unsaturated, Saturated, Trans) is 9 kcal/g.\n4.  **Calculate total fat in grams:** Mass (g) = Calories (kcal) / Energy density (kcal/g). So, Total fat = 900 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 100 g.\n\nThis matches option C."
