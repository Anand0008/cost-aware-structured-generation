      "reasoning": "1.  **Calculate the constant k**: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix `A = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `ad - bc`. For the given matrix `A = [[5, -4], [k, -1]]`, the determinant is `(5)(-1) - (-4)(k) = -5 + 4k`. Given that `det(A) = 3`, we have `-5 + 4k = 3`. Solving for `k`: `4k = 8`, so `k = 2`.\n2.  **Formulate the characteristic equation**: Substitute `k = 2` into the matrix `A`, making it `A = [[5, -4], [2, -1]]`. To find the eigenvalues `$\\lambda$`, we solve the characteristic equation `$\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$`, where `I` is the identity matrix. \n    `$A - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 - \\lambda & -4 \\ 2 & -1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$`\n    The determinant is `$(5 - \\lambda)(-1 - \\lambda) - (-4)(2) = 0$`. This simplifies to `$\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3 = 0$`.\n3.  **Solve for eigenvalues**: Factoring the quadratic equation: `$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 3) = 0$`. The eigenvalues are `$\\lambda_1 = 1$` and `$\\lambda_2 = 3$`.\n4.  **Identify the largest eigenvalue**: The largest eigenvalue is `$\\lambda_{max} = 3$`.\n5.  **Calculate the ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the largest eigenvalue of A to the constant `k`. Ratio = `$\\frac{\\lambda_{max}}{k} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$`.\n6.  **Round off**: Rounded off to 1 decimal place, the answer is 1.5."

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Avoids expanding the characteristic polynomial directly, leading to faster calculation and fewer algebraic errors for 2x2 matrices. Cons: Requires memorizing the trace and determinant relations for eigenvalues; still involves solving a quadratic equation.",
