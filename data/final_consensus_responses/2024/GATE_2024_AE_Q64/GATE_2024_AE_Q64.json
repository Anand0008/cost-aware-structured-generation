The solution involves multiple steps:\n1. Determine the aircraft's weight (which equals lift in steady level flight) using W = m * g.\n2. Calculate the dynamic pressure (q) using q = 0.5 * rho * V^2.\n3. Calculate the aspect ratio (AR) using AR = b^2 / S.\n4. Calculate the lift coefficient (CL) using CL = L / (q * S).\n5. Calculate the induced drag coefficient (CD,i) using the formula CD,i = CL^2 / (pi * e * AR), where for an elliptic planform, the span efficiency factor (e) is 1.\n6. Finally, calculate the induced drag (Di) using Di = q * S * CD,i. All steps align with fundamental aerodynamic principles and confirm the answer key is correct."

        "description": "Instead of assuming an elliptic lift distribution, the induced drag could be calculated using the general formula $C_{D,i} = C_L^2 / (\\pi e AR)$, where $e$ is the actual span efficiency factor, which may be less than 1.0 for non-elliptic planforms.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More accurate for non-elliptic wings. Cons: Requires knowing the actual span efficiency factor, which may not be given."

      "Flight Mechanics": "Induced drag affects aircraft performance parameters like climb rate, range, and endurance.",
      "Aircraft Structures": "High aspect ratio wings for low induced drag require stronger/ lighter materials to handle bending moments.",
      "Mathematics": "The π in the formula arises from integration of elliptic circulation distribution.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The concepts of circulation, vortex theory, and induced flow are fundamental to understanding the origins of induced drag on finite wings.",
