      "reasoning": "The question asks to match various thermodynamic processes for an ideal gas with their representations on a Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagram. We analyze each curve:\n\n1.  **Curve aa'**: This curve is a horizontal line on the T-S diagram. A horizontal line indicates that the temperature (T) remains constant throughout the process. By definition, a process occurring at constant temperature is an **Isothermal process** (`dT = 0`).\n\n2.  **Curve bb'**: This curve is a vertical line on the T-S diagram. A vertical line indicates that the entropy (S) remains constant throughout the process. By definition, a process occurring at constant entropy is an **Isentropic process** (`dS = 0`). An isentropic process is a reversible adiabatic process.\n\n3.  **Curves cc' and dd'**: These are curved lines with positive slopes. To differentiate between isobaric (constant pressure, `dP = 0`) and isochoric (constant volume, `dV = 0`) processes on a T-S diagram for an ideal gas, we need to compare their slopes.\n    *   For an ideal gas, the differential change in entropy is related to temperature and specific heat capacities. From the TdS relations:\n        *   For an isobaric process (`dP = 0`), `TdS = dH = C_p dT`. Therefore, the slope on a T-S diagram is `\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial S}\\right)_P = \\frac{T}{C_p}`.\n        *   For an isochoric process (`dV = 0`), `TdS = dU = C_v dT`. Therefore, the slope on a T-S diagram is `\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial S}\\right)_V = \\frac{T}{C_v}`.\n    *   For an ideal gas, the specific heat at constant pressure (`C_p`) is always greater than the specific heat at constant volume (`C_v`) (i.e., `C_p > C_v`).\n    *   Comparing the slopes: Since `C_p > C_v`, it implies that `\\frac{1}{C_v} > \\frac{1}{C_p}`. Consequently, `\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial S}\\right)_V > \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial S}\\right)_P`. This means that an **isochoric line is steeper than an isobaric line** when both pass through the same point on a T-S diagram.\n    *   Observing the diagram, curve `dd'` is visibly steeper than curve `cc'`. Therefore, `cc'` represents the **Isobaric process** and `dd'` represents the **Isochoric process**.\n\nCombining these matches:\n*   `aa'` – Isothermal\n*   `bb'` – Isentropic\n*   `cc'` – Isobaric\n*   `dd'` – Isochoric\n\nThis matches option C."

The heat addition in the combustor is often approximated as isobaric (constant pressure, curved line on T-S). The T-S diagram helps visualize the cycle's efficiency and performance.",

Correctly identifying processes is crucial for predicting efficiency, work output, and fuel consumption; misinterpretation can lead to wrong performance predictions and suboptimal design."
