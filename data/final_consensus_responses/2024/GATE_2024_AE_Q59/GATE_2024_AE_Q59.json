We need to find the static temperature at this sonic condition (T*). The key is to use the Fanno flow relation for the ratio of static temperature to the critical (sonic) static temperature.\n\nThe relevant formula from Fanno flow analysis is:\n$\\frac{T}{T^*} = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{2 + (\\gamma-1)M^2}$\n\nGiven:\nInitial static temperature, $T_1 = 273$ K\nInitial Mach number, $M_1 = 0.2$\nRatio of specific heats, $\\gamma = 1.4$\n\nWe apply the formula at the inlet condition ($M_1, T_1$):\n$\\frac{T_1}{T^*} = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\frac{273}{T^*} = \\frac{1.4+1}{2 + (1.4-1)(0.2)^2}$\n$\\frac{273}{T^*} = \\frac{2.4}{2 + (0.4)(0.04)}$\n$\\frac{273}{T^*} = \\frac{2.4}{2 + 0.016}$\n$\\frac{273}{T^*} = \\frac{2.4}{2.016}$\n\nNow, solve for $T^*$: \n$T^* = 273 \\times \\frac{2.016}{2.4}$\n$T^* = 273 \\times 0.84$\n$T^* = 229.32$ K\n\nThe calculated value of 229.32 K falls within the acceptable range of 227.0 to 231.0 specified by the answer key."
