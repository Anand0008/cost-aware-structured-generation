The Tresca yield criterion (also known as the Maximum Shear Stress criterion) is represented by a regular hexagon in the same principal stress plane. In the provided figure, Criterion P is a smooth, closed, nearly elliptical curve, matching the von Mises ellipse. Criterion Q is a more polygonal, piecewise-linear-like curve, consistent with the Tresca locus, which appears as a hexagon in the full principal stress plane. Therefore, statement A (Criterion P represents the von Mises criterion) and statement B (Criterion Q represents the Tresca criterion) are both correct."
