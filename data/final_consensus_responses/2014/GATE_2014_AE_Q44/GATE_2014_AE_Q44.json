      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the amplitude of the fifth cycle of a single degree of freedom system undergoing damped free vibration. The initial (first cycle) amplitude is given as $X_0 = 5$ cm, and the viscous damping factor (damping ratio) is $\\zeta = 2\\% = 0.02$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the logarithmic decrement ($\\delta$):**\n    The formula for logarithmic decrement is given by:\n    $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$\n    Substitute the given damping ratio $\\zeta = 0.02$:\n    $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi(0.02)}{\\sqrt{1-(0.02)^2}} = \\frac{0.04\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-0.0004}} = \\frac{0.04\\pi}{\\sqrt{0.9996}}$\n    $\\delta \\approx \\frac{0.04 \\times 3.14159}{0.9997999} \\approx 0.12569$\n\n2.  **Determine the amplitude decay over multiple cycles:**\n    The ratio of amplitudes over $N$ successive cycles is given by:\n    $\\frac{X_0}{X_N} = e^{N\\delta}$\n    Where $X_0$ is the initial amplitude and $X_N$ is the amplitude after $N$ cycles.\n\n3.  **Identify the number of cycles ($N$):**\n    The initial amplitude is $X_0$ (first cycle). We need the amplitude of the fifth cycle. This means $N=4$ cycles have passed from the initial amplitude $X_0$ to reach the amplitude of the fifth cycle, which we denote as $X_4$.\n    So, $X_0$ is the 1st cycle, $X_1$ is the 2nd cycle, $X_2$ is the 3rd cycle, $X_3$ is the 4th cycle, and $X_4$ is the 5th cycle.\n\n4.  **Calculate the amplitude of the fifth cycle ($X_4$):**\n    Using the formula $X_N = X_0 e^{-N\\delta}$:\n    $X_4 = X_0 e^{-4\\delta}$\n    $X_4 = 5 \\text{ cm} \\times e^{-4 \\times 0.12569}$\n    $X_4 = 5 \\text{ cm} \\times e^{-0.50276}$\n    $X_4 = 5 \\text{ cm} \\times 0.60471$\n    $X_4 \\approx 3.02355 \\text{ cm}$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the amplitude of the fifth cycle is approximately $3.02$ cm. This matches option D."
