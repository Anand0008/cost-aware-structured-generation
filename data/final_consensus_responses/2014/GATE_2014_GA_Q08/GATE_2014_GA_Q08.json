      "reasoning": "The quadrilateral's angles are in ratio 3:4:5:6. The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is $360^{\\circ}$. Let the angles be $3x, 4x, 5x, 6x$. Then $3x + 4x + 5x + 6x = 360^{\\circ}$, which means $18x = 360^{\\circ}$, so $x = 20^{\\circ}$. The angles of the quadrilateral are $3 \\times 20^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$, $4 \\times 20^{\\circ} = 80^{\\circ}$, $5 \\times 20^{\\circ} = 100^{\\circ}$, and $6 \\times 20^{\\circ} = 120^{\\circ}$. The smallest quadrilateral angle is $60^{\\circ}$ and the largest is $120^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe triangle's smallest angle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the smallest quadrilateral angle: $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60^{\\circ} = 40^{\\circ}$.\nThe triangle's largest angle is twice its smallest angle: $2 \\times 40^{\\circ} = 80^{\\circ}$.\nThe sum of angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$. So, the remaining (second largest) angle of the triangle is $180^{\\circ} - 40^{\\circ} - 80^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe required sum is the second largest angle of the triangle ($60^{\\circ}$) and the largest angle of the quadrilateral ($120^{\\circ}$). Sum = $60^{\\circ} + 120^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$."
