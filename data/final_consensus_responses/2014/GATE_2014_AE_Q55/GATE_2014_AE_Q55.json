      "reasoning": "The rate of climb (R/C) is computed using the excess power method: $R/C = \\frac{P_{av} - P_R}{W}$. Given the data for steady level flight, the power required ($P_R$) is calculated from drag ($D$) and velocity ($V$). First, calculate the drag coefficient: $C_D = 0.025 + 0.04 C_L^2 = 0.025 + 0.04 (0.65)^2 = 0.025 + 0.0169 = 0.0419$. Since lift ($L$) equals weight ($W$) in steady level flight, and $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$ and $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$, we can express drag as $D = W \\frac{C_D}{C_L}$. Substituting the values: $D = 13000 \\text{ N} \\times \\frac{0.0419}{0.65} \\approx 838 \\text{ N}$. The power required is $P_R = D \\times V = 838 \\text{ N} \\times 40 \\text{ m/s} = 33520 \\text{ W}$. The excess power is $P_{excess} = P_{av} - P_R = 100000 \\text{ W} - 33520 \\text{ W} = 66480 \\text{ W}$. Finally, the rate of climb is $R/C = \\frac{P_{excess}}{W} = \\frac{66480 \\text{ W}}{13000 \\text{ N}} \\approx 5.1138 \\text{ m/s}$. This value matches option B (5.11 m/s)."

The objective is to find the rate of climb (R/C).",

Using the relationship $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$ and $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$, we can express drag as $D = W \\frac{C_D}{C_L}$.

        "Step 5: Calculate the excess power ($P_{excess}$), which is the difference between the power available and the power required: $P_{excess} = P_{av} - P_R = 100000 \\text{ W} - 33520 \\text{ W} = 66480 \\text{ W}$.",
