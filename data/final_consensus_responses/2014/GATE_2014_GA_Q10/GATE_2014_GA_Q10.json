      "reasoning": "Based on typical chart interpretation for rainfall data:\n(i) On average, it rains more in July than in December: This is generally true for monsoon climates like Agra, where July is a peak monsoon month and December is a dry winter month. A rainfall chart would typically show higher average rainfall in July.\n(ii) Every year, the amount of rainfall in August is more than that in January: The term 'Every year' implies an absolute guarantee, which is rarely true for natural phenomena like rainfall due to year-to-year variability. While August generally has more rainfall than January, it's not guaranteed 'every year'. Thus, this statement is likely false.\n(iii) July rainfall can be estimated with better confidence than February rainfall: Confidence in estimation is inversely related to data spread or variability. Monsoon months like July typically have more consistent and higher rainfall, leading to a tighter distribution of values (less variability) compared to drier months like February, which might have highly variable or very low rainfall. Therefore, July rainfall can likely be estimated with better confidence.\n(iv) In August, there is at least 500 mm of rainfall: 'At least 500 mm' implies a minimum threshold. Without the actual chart, it's impossible to confirm this absolute minimum. Rainfall can vary significantly, and it's unlikely that the 0th percentile (or minimum observed rainfall) for August would be as high as 500 mm over 50 years. This statement is likely false.\n\nTherefore, statements (i) and (iii) are true. This corresponds to option B."

        "Recall the definition of a Streamline: A streamline is a curve everywhere tangent to the instantaneous velocity field. In unsteady flow, streamlines change with time. The line AB is formed by particles released at different times, not an instantaneous snapshot of the velocity field. Therefore, AB is not a streamline.",
        "Recall the definition of a Pathline: A pathline is the actual trajectory traced by a single fluid particle over a period of time. The line AB consists of multiple distinct particles, not the continuous path of a single particle. Therefore, AB is not a pathline.",
        "Recall the definition of a Streakline: A streakline is the locus of all fluid particles that have passed through a common fixed point in space (point A in this scenario) at some earlier time. The method of injecting bubbles from point A at intervals and observing their collective positions at an instant perfectly matches this definition.",
