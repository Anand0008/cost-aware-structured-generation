Anderson's 'Intro to Aerodynamics'):\n\n1.  **Design Lift Coefficient ($C_L$):** The first digit (L) of the NACA 5-digit designation, when multiplied by 0.15, gives the design lift coefficient. For NACA12018, the first digit $L = 1$. Therefore, $C_L = 1 \\times 0.15 = 0.15$.\n\n2.  **Location of Maximum Camber ($X_m$):** The second and third digits (PP) of the NACA 5-digit designation, when divided by 2, gives the location of maximum camber from the leading edge in hundredths of the chord. This can be expressed as $\\frac{PP}{200} \\times c$.\n    For NACA12018, the second and third digits $PP = 20$. Therefore, $X_m = \\frac{20}{200} \\times c = 0.10c$.\n\nCombining these results, for NACA12018, $C_L = 0.15$ and $X_m = 0.1c$. This matches option A."
