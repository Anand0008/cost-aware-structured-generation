      "reasoning": "The Dutch roll mode is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode characterized by coupled yawing and rolling motions. Aircraft control surfaces are designed to primarily affect specific motions: elevators control longitudinal (pitch) motion, ailerons control lateral (roll) motion, and the rudder controls directional (yaw) motion. To excite the Dutch roll mode, an input that directly generates a yawing moment is most effective. A step input to the rudder directly introduces a yawing moment, thereby exciting the coupled yaw and roll motions characteristic of the Dutch roll mode. Elevators affect longitudinal modes, not lateral-directional. While ailerons can influence Dutch roll due to coupling, a step input to the rudder is the most direct and common method for exciting this mode."

        "To excite a specific dynamic mode like Dutch roll, apply an input that directly perturbs the state variables involved, particularly yaw/sideslip dynamics.",
        "Eliminate options involving elevators (A and D) as they primarily affect longitudinal modes. A sinusoidal input to the aileron (C) primarily induces roll oscillations and is less direct for exciting the coupled yaw motion of Dutch roll.",
        "The most appropriate input is a step input to the rudder (B). The rudder directly controls yaw, which is a primary component of the Dutch roll mode. A step input to the rudder creates a yawing moment, directly exciting the coupled yaw-roll oscillation.",
        "This approach is consistent with standard flight testing practices where a step rudder input is commonly used to observe and analyze the Dutch roll response."
