      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the mass flow rate through a converging-diverging diffuser of a jet engine, given the aircraft's flight Mach number, ambient conditions, and the throat area. The flow is considered isentropic. The aircraft free-stream is at Mach 3.0. For an isentropic inlet/diffuser, the stagnation (reservoir) conditions at the diffuser entrance are obtained from the free-stream Mach number and ambient static conditions. The throat of a converging-diverging passage, especially with supersonic inflow, will be choked (Mach number M=1) for maximum mass flow. Therefore, we need to calculate the mass flow rate at the choked throat conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Stagnation Temperature ($T_0$) and Stagnation Pressure ($p_0$) at the inlet.**\nThe ambient conditions (pressure $p = 50 \\text{ kPa}$, temperature $T = 200 \\text{ K}$) are static conditions at Mach 3.0. We use the isentropic relations to find the stagnation conditions:\n\nGiven: $M = 3.0$, $T = 200 \\text{ K}$, $p = 50 \\text{ kPa}$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287 \\text{ J/kgK}$.\n\n$T_0 = T \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M^2\\right)$\n$T_0 = 200 \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} (3.0)^2\\right)$\n$T_0 = 200 \\left(1 + 0.2 \\times 9\\right)$\n$T_0 = 200 \\left(1 + 1.8\\right) = 200 \\times 2.8 = 560 \\text{ K}$\n\n$p_0 = p \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n$p_0 = 50 \\left(2.8\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{0.4}}$\n$p_0 = 50 \\left(2.8\\right)^{3.5}$\n$p_0 = 50 \\times 36.700 = 1835 \\text{ kPa} = 1835000 \\text{ Pa}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Static Properties at the Throat ($M^*=1$).**\nAt the throat, $M^* = 1$. We use the isentropic relations from stagnation conditions to throat conditions:\n\n$T^* = \\frac{T_0}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} (1)^2} = \\frac{560}{1 + 0.2} = \\frac{560}{1.2} = 466.667 \\text{ K}$\n\n$p^* = \\frac{p_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} (1)^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}} = \\frac{1835}{\\left(1.2\\right)^{3.5}} = \\frac{1835}{1.8920} = 969.87 \\text{ kPa} = 969870 \\text{ Pa}$\n\n$\\rho^* = \\frac{p^*}{R T^*} = \\frac{969870}{287 \\times 466.667} = \\frac{969870}{133833.333} = 7.2468 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n\n$a^* = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T^*} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 466.667} = \\sqrt{187466.667} = 432.974 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Mass Flow Rate ($\\dot{m}$).**\nThe mass flow rate through the throat is given by:\n$\\dot{m} = \\rho^* A^* a^*$\nGiven throat area $A^* = 0.05 \\text{ m}^2$.\n\n$\\dot{m} = 7.2468 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times 0.05 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 432.974 \\text{ m/s}$\n$\\dot{m} = 156.84 \\text{ kg/s}$\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the mass flow rate is $157 \\text{ kg/s}$, which corresponds to option D."
