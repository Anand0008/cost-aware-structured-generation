(Match: a - ii)\n2.  **High subsonic civilian aircraft (b):** Turbofan engines (iv) are dominant for modern commercial airliners (Mach 0.8-0.85) due to their superior fuel efficiency, high thrust, and lower noise, achieved by bypassing a significant portion of air. (Match: b - iv)\n3.  **Supersonic fighter aircraft (c):** Turbojet engines (iii) generate thrust primarily from a high-velocity exhaust jet and are well-suited for supersonic speeds, offering high thrust-to-weight ratios. (Match: c - iii)\n4.  **Hypersonic aircraft (d):** Ramjet engines (i) rely on forward motion for air compression and become efficient only at high supersonic and hypersonic speeds (Mach 5 and above).

Quickly recall the key performance characteristics and speed regimes for each engine type: Low speed → Turboprop, High subsonic civilian → Turbofan, Supersonic fighter → Turbojet, Hypersonic → Ramjet. If unsure, eliminate obvious mismatches first.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, try to eliminate clearly incorrect options by identifying engine-aircraft pairings that are completely mismatched in terms of speed, altitude, or thrust requirements. Confidently matching distinct pairs like Turboprop for low speed and Ramjet for hypersonic can help narrow down choices for an educated guess.",

        "description": "Instead of direct recall, visualize or sketch the propulsive efficiency curves for each engine type as a function of Mach number. Turboprops peak at low Mach (M < 0.6), turbofans at high subsonic (0.6 < M < 0.9), turbojets at supersonic (up to ~M 2-3), and ramjets at very high supersonic/hypersonic (M > 3). This helps in matching aircraft types to overlapping engine ranges.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Deeper understanding, visual and intuitive, helps long-term retention, more rigorous, less prone to recall errors, helps in novel situations. Cons: Requires more detailed knowledge of efficiency trends/engine performance analysis, slower than direct recall for quick exam questions.",

Understanding Brayton cycle analysis and its efficiency, dependent on pressure ratio and temperature limits, is crucial for explaining engine performance across different regimes.",
      "Aerodynamics": "The interaction of the engine with the airflow (e.g., ram compression for ramjets, propeller aerodynamics for turboprops) is crucial for performance. Inlet design for ramjets and scramjets involves shock wave interactions, and drag characteristics at different Mach numbers influence optimal propulsion.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "Engine thrust and efficiency (including SFC) directly influence aircraft performance parameters such as range, endurance, climb rate, ceiling, and maximum speed, which are core flight mechanics concepts.",
      "Aircraft Design": "The choice of propulsion system is one of the most fundamental decisions in aircraft design, driven by mission requirements and performance goals.",

      "Fluid Mechanics": "The flow of air and combustion products through the engine components is governed by fluid mechanics principles.",
