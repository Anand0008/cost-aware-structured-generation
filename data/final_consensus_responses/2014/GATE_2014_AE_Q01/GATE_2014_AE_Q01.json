      "reasoning": "A real symmetric matrix is always orthogonally diagonalizable, as stated by the Spectral Theorem for Symmetric Matrices. This means it can always be expressed as $A = P D P^T$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. However, a real symmetric matrix is not necessarily invertible. Invertibility requires that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero, which is equivalent to having no zero eigenvalues. A symmetric matrix can have zero eigenvalues (e.g., a singular matrix like one with a row of zeros), in which case it is not invertible. Therefore, the matrix is always diagonalizable but not necessarily invertible."

        "Step 1: Understand the definition and core properties of a real symmetric matrix. A matrix $A$ is real symmetric if all its entries are real and $A = A^T$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the Spectral Theorem for real symmetric matrices. This theorem states that a real symmetric matrix is always orthogonally diagonalizable. This means there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A = P D P^T$. Therefore, a real symmetric matrix is *always* diagonalizable.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the conditions for matrix invertibility. A square matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero, which is equivalent to all its eigenvalues being non-zero. In the context of diagonalization ($A = P D P^T$), this means all diagonal entries in $D$ (which are the eigenvalues) must be non-zero.",
        "Step 4: Demonstrate that a real symmetric matrix is not necessarily invertible using a counterexample. Consider the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix is real and symmetric ($A = A^T$). Its determinant is $det(A) = 0$, and it has a zero eigenvalue. Therefore, this matrix is not invertible, even though it is symmetric and diagonalizable.",
        "Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis. A real symmetric matrix is always diagonalizable (by the Spectral Theorem) but is not necessarily invertible (as shown by counterexamples with zero eigenvalues). Therefore, the correct statement is that the matrix is always diagonalizable but not necessarily invertible."
