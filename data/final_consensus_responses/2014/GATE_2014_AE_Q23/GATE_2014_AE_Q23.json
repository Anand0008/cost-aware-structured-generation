      "reasoning": "Minimum sink rate for a glider refers to the flight condition where the aircraft loses altitude at the slowest possible rate, thereby maximizing its time airborne (endurance). The sink rate, $V_{\\text{sink}}$, can be expressed as $V_{\\text{sink}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S}} \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$. To achieve minimum sink rate, the term $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$ must be minimized. This is equivalent to maximizing the ratio $\\frac{C_L^{3/2}}{C_D}$. Therefore, the condition for minimum sink rate is to achieve Minimum $C_D / C_L^{3/2}$. It is important to note that maximizing $C_L/C_D$ corresponds to maximum glide range, not minimum sink rate (maximum endurance)."

        "The minimum sink rate for a glider corresponds to the condition where the aircraft loses altitude at the slowest possible rate, allowing it to remain airborne for the longest duration (maximum endurance).",
        "The sink rate ($V_s$) is the vertical component of the glider's velocity ($V$) and is given by $V_s = V \\sin\\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the glide path angle.",
        "In steady gliding flight, the lift (L) approximately equals the weight (W) for small glide angles, and drag (D) equals $W \\sin\\gamma$. Thus, $\\sin\\gamma \\approx D/L = C_D/C_L$. Also, airspeed $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}}$.",
        "Substituting these into the sink rate equation, we get $V_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}} \\cdot \\frac{C_D}{C_L} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S}} \\cdot \\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$.",
        "To minimize $V_s$, the aerodynamic term $\\frac{C_D}{C_L^{3/2}}$ must be minimized, as other terms ($W, \\rho, S$) are constant for a given flight condition. This is equivalent to maximizing $\\frac{C_L^{3/2}}{C_D}$.",
        "This condition (minimizing $C_D / C_L^{3/2}$) is also known to occur when the induced drag coefficient ($C_{D,i}$) is three times the zero-lift drag coefficient ($C_{D,0}$), i.e., $C_{D,i} = 3 C_{D,0}$, which is derived from the drag polar $C_D = C_{D,0} + K C_L^2$."
