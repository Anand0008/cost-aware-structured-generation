The pressure thrust is provided as additional information but acts as a distractor. The fundamental definition of specific impulse relates total thrust, propellant mass flow rate, and standard gravity: $I_{sp} = \\frac{F_{total}}{\\dot{m}_p g_0}$. Given $I_{sp} = 200\\text{ s}$, $F_{total} = 98\\text{ kN} = 98 \\times 10^3\\text{ N}$, and $g_0 = 9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$. Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\dot{m}_p$: $\\dot{m}_p = \\frac{F_{total}}{I_{sp} g_0}$. Substituting the values: $\\dot{m}_p = \\frac{98 \\times 10^3\\text{ N}}{(200\\text{ s})(9.8\\text{ m/s}^2)} = \\frac{98000}{1960} = 50\\text{ kg/s}$. This result matches option C."

Convert the total thrust to Newtons: $F_{total} = 98 \\times 10^3\\text{ N}$. Note that the pressure thrust (10 kN) is a distractor, as specific impulse is typically defined using the total thrust.",

        "description": "Since I_sp = v_e / g_0, then v_e = I_sp * g_0. The total thrust is F = \\dot{m}_p * v_e + (p_e - p_a)A_e. But here, (p_e - p_a)A_e is the pressure thrust (10 kN). So, F_total = \\dot{m}_p * v_e + F_pressure. Then, \\dot{m}_p = (F_total - F_pressure) / v_e. This yields the same answer only if v_e is defined correctly. Actually, careful: The standard definition of effective exhaust velocity c is such that F_total = \\dot{m}_p * c. And c = I_sp * g_0. So this method is equivalent to the direct formula.",
