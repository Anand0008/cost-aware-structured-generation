      "reasoning": "The problem describes a semi-elliptic distribution of circulation given by Gamma^2/Gamma_0^2 + z^2/s^2 = 1, which can be rewritten as Gamma(z) = Gamma_0 sqrt(1 - (z/s)^2). This is the standard form for an elliptical circulation distribution over a span of 2s.\n\n**Part 1: Determine I**\nFor an elliptical circulation distribution, Prandtl's lifting line theory states that the induced downwash w is constant across the entire span. The question provides the downwash formula as w(z1) = (Gamma_0 / (4pi s)) [pi + z1 I]. Since w(z1) must be constant and independent of z1, the term z1 I must be zero for any z1 != 0. This implies that I = 0.\n\n**Part 2: Determine Induced Drag D_i**\n1.  **Calculate constant downwash (w):** With I = 0, the downwash simplifies to w = Gamma_0 / (4s).\n2.  **Calculate Total Lift (L):**\n    The total lift L generated by a wing can be calculated using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem integrated over the span:\n    L = rho V_inf integral from -s to s Gamma(z) dz\n    Substitute the elliptical circulation distribution:\n    L = rho V_inf integral from -s to s Gamma_0 sqrt(1 - (z/s)^2) dz\n    L = rho V_inf Gamma_0 integral from -s to s sqrt(1 - z^2/s^2) dz\n    The integral integral from -s to s sqrt(1 - z^2/s^2) dz represents the area of a semi-ellipse with semi-axes s and 1, which is (1/2) * pi * s * 1 = pi s / 2.\n    Therefore, L = rho V_inf Gamma_0 (pi s / 2).\n3.  **Calculate Induced Angle of Attack (alpha_i):**\n    The induced angle of attack is given by alpha_i = w / V_inf (in radians).\n    alpha_i = (Gamma_0 / (4s)) / V_inf = Gamma_0 / (4s V_inf)\n4.  **Calculate Induced Drag (D_i):**\n    The induced drag D_i is given by the product of lift L and the induced angle of attack alpha_i:\n    D_i = L * alpha_i\n    Substitute the expressions for L and alpha_i:\n    D_i = (rho V_inf Gamma_0 (pi s / 2)) * (Gamma_0 / (4s V_inf))\n    Simplify the expression:\n    D_i = (rho Gamma_0^2 pi s V_inf) / (8s V_inf)\n    D_i = (pi rho Gamma_0^2) / 8\n\nCombining the results, I = 0 and D_i = (pi rho Gamma_0^2) / 8. This matches option C."

        "Recognize the circulation distribution is elliptic from the given equation $\\Gamma^2/\\Gamma_0^2 + z^2/s^2 = 1$, which implies $\\Gamma(z) = \\Gamma_0\\sqrt{1 - z^2/s^2}$. Note that $s$ is the half-span, so the total span $b = 2s$.",
        "For an elliptical circulation distribution, the induced downwash $w$ is constant across the entire wing span. The given downwash expression is $w(z_1) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4\\pi s} [\\pi + z_1 I]$. For $w$ to be constant (independent of $z_1$), the term $z_1 I$ must vanish, which implies $I = 0$.",
        "With $I = 0$, the downwash velocity becomes $w = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4\\pi s} \\cdot \\pi = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4s}$. This is consistent with the general formula for constant downwash for an elliptic lift distribution, $w = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{2b}$, since $b=2s$.",
        "The induced drag $D_i$ for a lifting line is given by the integral $D_i = \\rho \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) w(z) dz$. Since the downwash $w$ is constant for an elliptic circulation distribution, this simplifies to $D_i = \\rho w \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) dz$.",
        "Next, compute the integral of circulation over the span: $\\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) dz = \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{z^2}{s^2}} dz = \\Gamma_0 \\int_{-s}^{s} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{z^2}{s^2}} dz$. This standard elliptic integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi s}{2}$. Therefore, $\\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) dz = \\Gamma_0 \\frac{\\pi s}{2}$.",
        "Now substitute the constant downwash $w = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4s}$ and the integral $\\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) dz = \\frac{\\pi \\Gamma_0 s}{2}$ into the induced drag formula: $D_i = \\rho w \\int_{-s}^{s} \\Gamma(z) dz = \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{4s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\Gamma_0 s}{2}\\right)$.",
        "Simplify the expression for $D_i$: $D_i = \\frac{\\pi \\rho \\Gamma_0^2}{8}$.",
