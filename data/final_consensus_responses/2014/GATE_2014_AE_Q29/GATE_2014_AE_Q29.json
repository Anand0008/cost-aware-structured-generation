      "reasoning": "The problem is a second-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients and boundary conditions. The solution involves finding the complementary solution ($u_h(x)$) and a particular solution ($u_p(x)$), then combining them to form the general solution $u(x) = u_h(x) + u_p(x)$. Finally, the given boundary conditions are applied to determine the arbitrary constants.\n\n1.  **Rewrite the ODE:** The given ODE is $-9 \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + u = 5x$. Dividing by -9, we get $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{9}u = -\\frac{5}{9}x$.\n2.  **Homogeneous Solution ($u_h(x)$):** The characteristic equation for $u'' - \\frac{1}{9}u = 0$ is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{9} = 0$, which gives $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $u_h(x) = C_1 e^{x/3} + C_2 e^{-x/3}$.\n3.  **Particular Solution ($u_p(x)$):** For the non-homogeneous term $5x$, we assume a particular solution of the form $u_p(x) = Ax + B$. Differentiating, $u_p'(x) = A$ and $u_p''(x) = 0$. Substituting into the original ODE: $-9(0) + (Ax + B) = 5x$. This implies $Ax + B = 5x$, so $A=5$ and $B=0$. Hence, $u_p(x) = 5x$.\n4.  **General Solution ($u(x)$):** Combining the homogeneous and particular solutions, $u(x) = C_1 e^{x/3} + C_2 e^{-x/3} + 5x$.\n5.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   **BC 1: $u(0) = 0$**\n        $u(0) = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 + 5(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -C_1$.\n        So, $u(x) = C_1 (e^{x/3} - e^{-x/3}) + 5x$.\n    *   **BC 2: $\\frac{du}{dx}|_{x=3} = 0$**\n        First, find the derivative of $u(x)$: $u'(x) = C_1 (\\frac{1}{3} e^{x/3} - (-\\frac{1}{3}) e^{-x/3}) + 5 = \\frac{C_1}{3} (e^{x/3} + e^{-x/3}) + 5$.\n        Now apply $u'(3) = 0$: $\\frac{C_1}{3} (e^{3/3} + e^{-3/3}) + 5 = 0 \\implies \\frac{C_1}{3} (e + e^{-1}) + 5 = 0$.\n        $\\frac{C_1}{3} (\\frac{e^2+1}{e}) = -5 \\implies C_1 (\\frac{e^2+1}{e}) = -15 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{15e}{e^2+1}$.\n6.  **Final Solution:** Substitute $C_1$ back into the expression for $u(x)$: \n    $u(x) = -\\frac{15e}{e^2+1} (e^{x/3} - e^{-x/3}) + 5x$. \n    This can be rewritten as $u(x) = \\frac{15e}{1+e^2} (e^{-x/3} - e^{x/3}) + 5x$, which matches Option A."

        "Step 1: Write the given boundary value problem: $-9 \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + u = 5x$, with $u(0)=0$ and $\\frac{du}{dx}$ at $x=3 = 0$.",
        "Step 2: Rewrite the differential equation in standard form: $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{9}u = -\\frac{5}{9}x$. Solve the homogeneous equation $-9u'' + u = 0$. The characteristic equation is $-9r^2 + 1 = 0$, which gives $r = \\pm 1/3$. The homogeneous solution is $u_h(x) = A e^{x/3} + B e^{-x/3}$.",
        "Step 3: Find a particular solution $u_p(x)$ for the non-homogeneous term $5x$. Assume $u_p(x) = Cx + D$. Substituting into the original ODE: $-9(0) + (Cx+D) = 5x$, which implies $C=5$ and $D=0$. Thus, $u_p(x) = 5x$.",
        "Step 4: Form the general solution by combining the homogeneous and particular solutions: $u(x) = u_h(x) + u_p(x) = A e^{x/3} + B e^{-x/3} + 5x$.",
        "Step 5: Apply the first boundary condition $u(0)=0$: $u(0) = A e^0 + B e^0 + 5(0) = A + B = 0$. This gives $B = -A$.",
        "Step 6: Differentiate the general solution to find $u'(x)$: $u'(x) = \\frac{A}{3} e^{x/3} - \\frac{B}{3} e^{-x/3} + 5$. Apply the second boundary condition $u'(3)=0$: $u'(3) = \\frac{A}{3} e^{3/3} - \\frac{B}{3} e^{-3/3} + 5 = \\frac{A}{3}e - \\frac{B}{3e} + 5 = 0$. Multiply by 3: $Ae - \\frac{B}{e} + 15 = 0$.",
        "Step 7: Solve the system of equations for A and B: (1) $A + B = 0 \\implies B = -A$. (2) $Ae - \\frac{B}{e} + 15 = 0$. Substitute $B=-A$ into (2): $Ae - \\frac{(-A)}{e} + 15 = 0 \\implies A(e + \\frac{1}{e}) + 15 = 0 \\implies A(\\frac{e^2+1}{e}) = -15 \\implies A = -\\frac{15e}{e^2+1}$. Then $B = -A = \\frac{15e}{e^2+1}$.",
        "Step 8: Substitute the values of A and B back into the general solution: $u(x) = \\left(-\\frac{15e}{e^2+1}\\right) e^{x/3} + \\left(\\frac{15e}{e^2+1}\\right) e^{-x/3} + 5x = \\frac{15e}{e^2+1} (e^{-x/3} - e^{x/3}) + 5x$. This matches option A."
