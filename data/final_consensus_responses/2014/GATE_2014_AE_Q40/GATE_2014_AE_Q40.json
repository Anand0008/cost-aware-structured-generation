      "reasoning": "The problem requires finding the temperature increase $\\Delta T$ at which a structural member, rigidly fixed at both ends, will buckle. This involves two main principles:\n1.  **Thermal Stress:** An increase in temperature in a rigidly fixed bar induces compressive stress. The thermal stress ($\\sigma_T$) is given by $\\sigma_T = E \\alpha \\Delta T$.\n2.  **Euler Buckling:** A column under axial compressive load will buckle when the compressive stress reaches the critical buckling stress ($\\sigma_{cr}$). For a column with fixed-fixed ends, the critical buckling load is $P_{cr} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 E I_{min}}{L^2}$. The critical buckling stress is then $\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{P_{cr}}{A} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 E I_{min}}{A L^2}$.\n\nBuckling occurs when the induced thermal stress equals the critical buckling stress:\n$\\sigma_T = \\sigma_{cr}$\n$E \\alpha \\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 E I_{min}}{A L^2}$\n\nFrom this, we can solve for $\\Delta T$:\n$\\alpha \\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 I_{min}}{A L^2}$\n$\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 I_{min}}{\\alpha A L^2}$\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Cross-section dimensions: $b = 10 \\text{ mm}$, $h = 6 \\text{ mm}$\n*   Length: $L = 1 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}$\n*   Young's Modulus: $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n*   Coefficient of thermal expansion: $\\alpha = 12 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ C$\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n1.  **Calculate Cross-sectional Area (A):**\n    $A = b \\times h = 10 \\text{ mm} \\times 6 \\text{ mm} = 60 \\text{ mm}^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate Minimum Moment of Inertia ($I_{min}$):**\n    Buckling will occur about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia. For a rectangular cross-section, the moments of inertia are $\\frac{bh^3}{12}$ and $\\frac{hb^3}{12}$.\n    *   $I_x = \\frac{b h^3}{12} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mm} \\times (6 \\text{ mm})^3}{12} = \\frac{10 \\times 216}{12} = 10 \\times 18 = 180 \\text{ mm}^4$\n    *   $I_y = \\frac{h b^3}{12} = \\frac{6 \\text{ mm} \\times (10 \\text{ mm})^3}{12} = \\frac{6 \\times 1000}{12} = 500 \\text{ mm}^4$\n    The minimum moment of inertia is $I_{min} = 180 \\text{ mm}^4$.\n\n3.  **Determine Effective Length Factor (K):**\n    The member is \"rigidly fixed at both the ends\". For buckling analysis, this implies fixed-fixed end conditions, for which the effective length factor $K = 0.5$. This means the effective length $L_e = K L = 0.5 L$. The Euler critical load formula for fixed-fixed ends is $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{(K L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{(0.5 L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I_{min}}{0.25 L^2} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 E I_{min}}{L^2}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\Delta T$:**\n    Using the derived formula: $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 I_{min}}{\\alpha A L^2}$\n    Substitute the values:\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times 180 \\text{ mm}^4}{(12 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ C) \\times (60 \\text{ mm}^2) \\times (1000 \\text{ mm})^2}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times 180}{(12 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 60 \\times (10^3)^2}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times 180}{(12 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 60 \\times 10^6}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times 180}{12 \\times 60}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times 180}{720}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{4}$\n    $\\Delta T = \\pi^2$\n\n    Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$\n    $\\Delta T \\approx 9.87 \\ ^\\circ C$\n\nThis value matches option B."

Recognize that the member is rigidly fixed at both ends, implying fixed-fixed boundary conditions for buckling.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the cross-sectional area A and the minimum moment of inertia I_min for the rectangular cross-section. The member will buckle about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia. For a 10 mm x 6 mm section: A = 10 mm * 6 mm = 60 mm². I_min = (10 mm * (6 mm)³) / 12 = 180 mm⁴.",
        "Step 3: Determine the effective length factor K based on the fixed-fixed end conditions, which is K = 0.5. Calculate the critical buckling load P_cr using Euler's buckling formula: P_cr = (π²EI_min) / (K L)² = 4π²EI_min / L².",
        "Step 4: Formulate the compressive force P_th induced in the bar due to a temperature increase ΔT. Since the bar is fully constrained, the thermal stress σ_T = EαΔT, and the compressive force is P_th = Aσ_T = AEαΔT.",
        "Step 5: Equate the thermal compressive force to the critical buckling load (P_th = P_cr) to find the temperature increase ΔT at which buckling occurs: AEαΔT = 4π²EI_min / L². Note that Young's modulus E cancels out from both sides.",
        "Step 6: Solve the simplified equation for ΔT: ΔT = (4π²I_min) / (AαL²).",
        "Step 7: Convert all numerical values to consistent units (e.g., meters for length and mm, and Pascals for GPa): I_min = 180 × 10⁻¹² m⁴, A = 60 × 10⁻⁶ m², α = 12 × 10⁻⁶ /°C, L = 1 m.",
        "Step 8: Substitute the values into the equation and calculate ΔT: ΔT = (4π² * 180 × 10⁻¹²) / (60 × 10⁻⁶ * 12 × 10⁻⁶ * (1)²) ≈ 9.87°C. This value corresponds to option B."
