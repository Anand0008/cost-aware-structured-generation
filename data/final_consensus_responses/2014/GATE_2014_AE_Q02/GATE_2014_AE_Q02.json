It should be a quick 2-3 minute problem: identify the power series, apply the ratio test, compute the simple limit, and take the reciprocal. Problems with simple algebraic/exponential terms are usually quick; factorials might take slightly longer.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, eliminate R=0 and R=infinity unless coefficients grow factorially or decay super-exponentially; R is often finite nonzero for polynomial/power coefficients. If you calculate L and it's a simple fraction, R will likely be its reciprocal (e.g., L=1/3 implies R=3). For coefficients like m^k/3^m, the exponential term often dictates R, making it related to the base (e.g., R=3).",
      "time_management": "Allocate no more than 3 minutes. If the algebraic simplification becomes too complex or the limit isn't immediately obvious, flag the question and return later if time permits. This problem type should generally be straightforward."
