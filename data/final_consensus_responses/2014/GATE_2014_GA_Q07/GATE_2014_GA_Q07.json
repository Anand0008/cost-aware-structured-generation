      "reasoning": "The problem requires systematically applying the given clues to determine the floor assignments for each person. We can use a process of elimination and deduction.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Six people: Anuj (A), Bhola (B), Chandan (C), Dilip (D), Eswar (E), Faisal (F)\n*   Six floors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n**Clues:**\n1.  Anuj lives on an even-numbered floor. (A ∈ {2, 4, 6})\n2.  Bhola does not live on an odd-numbered floor. (B ∈ {2, 4, 6})\n3.  Chandan does not live on any of the floors below Faisal's floor. (C > F)\n4.  Dilip does not live on floor number 2. (D ≠ 2)\n5.  Eswar does not live on a floor immediately above or immediately below Bhola. (E ≠ B+1 and E ≠ B-1)\n6.  Faisal lives three floors above Dilip. (F = D + 3)\n\n**Step-by-step Deduction:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 6 (F = D + 3)**\nThis is a very restrictive clue. Let's list possible (Dilip, Faisal) pairs:\n*   If D = 1, then F = 1 + 3 = 4. (D=1, F=4)\n*   If D = 2, then F = 2 + 3 = 5. However, Clue 4 states D ≠ 2. So, this pair is invalid.\n*   If D = 3, then F = 3 + 3 = 6. (D=3, F=6)\n\nSo, we have two main cases to consider: (D=1, F=4) or (D=3, F=6).\n\n**Case 1: Dilip lives on Floor 1 (D=1) and Faisal lives on Floor 4 (F=4)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, F=4\n*   Remaining floors: {2, 3, 5, 6}\n*   Remaining people: A, B, C, E\n\nNow apply other clues to the remaining people and floors:\n*   Clue 1: A is even. A ∈ {2, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 2: B is even. B ∈ {2, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 3: C > F. Since F=4, C must be on a floor higher than 4. C ∈ {5, 6} (from remaining floors).\n*   Clue 5: E ≠ B+1 and E ≠ B-1.\n\nLet's try assigning A and B to the even floors {2, 6}:\n\n**Subcase 1.1: Anuj on Floor 2 (A=2) and Bhola on Floor 6 (B=6)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, A=2, F=4, B=6\n*   Remaining floors: {3, 5}\n*   Remaining people: C, E\n\n*   From Clue 3 (C > F, i.e., C > 4): C must be on Floor 5.\n*   This leaves E for Floor 3.\n\nSo, the arrangement is: D=1, A=2, E=3, F=4, C=5, B=6.\nLet's verify all clues for this arrangement:\n1.  A is even (A=2) - **Satisfied**\n2.  B is even (B=6) - **Satisfied**\n3.  C > F (C=5, F=4) - **Satisfied**\n4.  D ≠ 2 (D=1) - **Satisfied**\n5.  E ≠ B+1 and E ≠ B-1 (E=3, B=6. E ≠ 7 and E ≠ 5) - **Satisfied**\n6.  F = D+3 (F=4, D=1) - **Satisfied**\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all conditions. Let's list it by person:\nAnuj: 2, Bhola: 6, Chandan: 5, Dilip: 1, Eswar: 3, Faisal: 4.\nThis matches **Option B**.\n\n**Subcase 1.2: Anuj on Floor 6 (A=6) and Bhola on Floor 2 (B=2)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=1, B=2, F=4, A=6\n*   Remaining floors: {3, 5}\n*   Remaining people: C, E\n\n*   From Clue 3 (C > F, i.e., C > 4): C must be on Floor 5.\n*   This leaves E for Floor 3.\n\nSo, the arrangement is: D=1, B=2, E=3, F=4, C=5, A=6.\nLet's verify Clue 5:\n5.  E ≠ B+1 and E ≠ B-1 (E=3, B=2. Here, B+1 = 2+1 = 3. So E is immediately above B). This **violates** Clue 5.\n\nTherefore, Subcase 1.2 is invalid.\n\n**Case 2: Dilip lives on Floor 3 (D=3) and Faisal lives on Floor 6 (F=6)**\n*   Occupied floors: D=3, F=6\n*   Remaining floors: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n*   Remaining people: A, B, C, E\n\n*   Clue 3: C > F. Since F=6, C must be on a floor higher than 6. This is impossible as 6 is the highest floor.\n\nTherefore, Case 2 is invalid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only valid arrangement is from Subcase 1.1, which corresponds to Option B."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: List all persons (Anuj, Bhola, Chandan, Dilip, Eswar, Faisal) and floors (1 to 6). Clearly write down each clue as a logical constraint: Anuj on an even floor, Bhola on an even floor, Chandan's floor > Faisal's floor, Dilip not on floor 2, Eswar not adjacent to Bhola, and Faisal lives three floors above Dilip (F = D + 3).",
        "Step 2: Identify the most restrictive numerical constraint: Faisal lives three floors above Dilip (F = D + 3). Given floors 1-6, the possible (Dilip, Faisal) pairs are (1,4), (2,5), and (3,6). Apply the constraint that Dilip does not live on floor 2 (D ≠ 2), which eliminates the pair (2,5). Thus, the only valid (Dilip, Faisal) pairs are (1,4) and (3,6).",
        "Step 3: Systematically explore each of the valid (Dilip, Faisal) pairs against the remaining constraints.",
        "Step 4: **Case 1: Dilip = 1, Faisal = 4.** The remaining floors are {2, 3, 5, 6} for Anuj, Bhola, Chandan, and Eswar. Apply the remaining constraints: Anuj and Bhola must be on even floors ({2, 6}). Chandan's floor must be greater than Faisal's (4). Eswar must not be adjacent to Bhola.\n    *   If Anuj = 2 and Bhola = 6: Remaining floors {3, 5}. Chandan > 4 implies Chandan = 5. Eswar = 3. Check Eswar (3) not adjacent to Bhola (6): |3-6|=3, which is not adjacent. This arrangement (D=1, A=2, E=3, F=4, C=5, B=6) is valid.\n    *   If Anuj = 6 and Bhola = 2: Remaining floors {3, 5}. Chandan > 4 implies Chandan = 5. Eswar = 3. Check Eswar (3) not adjacent to Bhola (2): |3-2|=1, which means they are adjacent. This arrangement is invalid.",
        "Step 5: **Case 2: Dilip = 3, Faisal = 6.** The remaining floors are {1, 2, 4, 5} for Anuj, Bhola, Chandan, and Eswar. Apply the constraint Chandan's floor > Faisal's (6). Since there are no floors above 6, this case is impossible for Chandan. Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.",
        "Step 6: The only consistent arrangement found is Dilip=1, Anuj=2, Eswar=3, Faisal=4, Chandan=5, Bhola=6. Rigorously verify this arrangement against all original constraints:\n    *   Anuj (2) is on an even floor (✓).\n    *   Bhola (6) is on an even floor (✓).\n    *   Chandan (5) is not below Faisal (4) (5 > 4, ✓).\n    *   Dilip (1) is not on floor 2 (✓).\n    *   Eswar (3) is not adjacent to Bhola (6) (|3-6|=3, ✓).\n    *   Faisal (4) is three floors above Dilip (1) (4 = 1 + 3, ✓).\n    All constraints are satisfied.",
        "Step 7: Conclude that the arrangement (Dilip=1, Anuj=2, Eswar=3, Faisal=4, Chandan=5, Bhola=6) is the unique solution that satisfies all given conditions."
