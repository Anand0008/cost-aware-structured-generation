      "reasoning": "Statement I: For a 50% reaction axial compressor stage, the static enthalpy (and pressure) rise is equally split between the rotor and stator. A defining characteristic of this design is that the velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet are symmetrical. This implies that the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet ($c_1$) is equal to the relative velocity at the rotor outlet ($w_2$), and the relative velocity at the rotor inlet ($w_1$) is equal to the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet ($c_2$). Similarly, the flow angles are symmetrical (e.g., $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$ and $\\beta_1 = \\alpha_2$). Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\nStatement II: The whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the entry of the rotor is $c_{t1}$ and at the entry of the stator (which is the exit of the rotor) is $c_{t2}$. For an axial flow compressor, work is done on the fluid by the rotor. According to the Euler turbomachinery equation, the specific work input ($W$) is given by $W = u(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$, where $u$ is the blade peripheral velocity. Since work is done on the fluid ($W > 0$) and $u$ is positive, it must be that $c_{t2} > c_{t1}$. This means the whirl component of absolute velocity increases across the rotor. Therefore, $c_{t1}$ and $c_{t2}$ cannot be the same. Thus, Statement II is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement I is correct, and Statement II is incorrect."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the definition of a 50% reaction axial compressor stage. The degree of reaction (R) is defined as the ratio of static enthalpy rise in the rotor to the total static enthalpy rise in the stage. For a 50% reaction stage (R=0.5), half of the static enthalpy rise occurs in the rotor and the other half in the stator.",
        "Step 2: Evaluate Statement I: 'Velocity triangles at the entry and exit of the rotor are symmetrical.' For a 50% reaction stage, under the common assumption of constant axial velocity, the velocity triangles at the rotor inlet and outlet are indeed symmetrical. This implies specific relationships between absolute and relative velocities and flow angles, such as $c_1 = w_2$ and $w_1 = c_2$, and flow angles like $\\alpha_1 = \\beta_2$ and $\\beta_1 = \\alpha_2$. Therefore, Statement I is correct.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Statement II: 'The whirl or swirl component of absolute velocity at the entry of rotor and entry of stator are same.' The 'entry of rotor' refers to the rotor inlet (station 1), with whirl component $c_{t1}$. The 'entry of stator' refers to the rotor outlet (station 2), with whirl component $c_{t2}$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the Euler turbomachinery equation for a compressor, which states that the specific work done on the fluid by the rotor is $W = u(c_{t2} - c_{t1})$. For a compressor, work is always done on the fluid ($W > 0$). Since the blade peripheral velocity $u$ is positive, it implies that the whirl component at the rotor outlet ($c_{t2}$) must be greater than the whirl component at the rotor inlet ($c_{t1}$). Therefore, $c_{t1} \\neq c_{t2}$.",
        "Step 5: Conclude on Statement II. Since $c_{t2} > c_{t1}$, the whirl components at the entry of the rotor and the entry of the stator (which is the rotor exit) are not the same. Therefore, Statement II is incorrect.",
        "Step 6: Combine the evaluations. Statement I is correct, and Statement II is incorrect. Based on this, the correct option is B."
