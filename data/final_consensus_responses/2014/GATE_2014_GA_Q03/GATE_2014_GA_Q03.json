      "reasoning": "The core of the problem lies in understanding the implication of Rajan's 'unhappiness'. If Rajan was unhappy that Sajan decided to do the project on his own, it logically follows that Rajan had a prior expectation or belief that they would be working together. Rajan's unhappiness is a direct emotional response to the unmet expectation of collaboration. Sajan's explanation confirms his preference for independent work, which further solidifies that Rajan's expectation of working together was not met. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 'Rajan has decided to work only in a group.' This is an overgeneralization. The text only states Rajan's unhappiness regarding Sajan's specific decision, not a general policy about his work preferences.\nB. 'Rajan and Sajan were formed into a group against their wishes.' The text does not mention them being 'formed into a group' by an external entity. Sajan's decision to work 'on his own' implies his choice, and his explanation of preferring to work independently further contradicts the idea that he was forced into a group against his wishes. Rajan's unhappiness is about Sajan's independent choice, not about being forced into a group.\nC. 'Sajan had decided to give in to Rajan’s request to work with him.' This is directly contradicted by the second sentence, where Sajan 'explained to Rajan that he preferred to work independently.' This clearly indicates Sajan did *not* give in to work with Rajan.\nD. 'Rajan had believed that Sajan and he would be working together.' This is the most logical inference. Rajan's unhappiness at Sajan's independent work strongly suggests that Rajan had an expectation or belief that they would collaborate. If he had no such belief, Sajan's decision to work alone would not necessarily cause him unhappiness in this context."

        "Step 2: Analyze the cause of Rajan's unhappiness. For Rajan to be unhappy about Sajan working alone, it logically implies that Rajan had an expectation or belief that they would be working together on the project.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: \"Rajan has decided to work only in a group.\" This is too broad and not directly supported by the text, which only describes his reaction to Sajan's specific decision.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: \"Rajan and Sajan were formed into a group against their wishes.\" This is not supported by the text; Sajan's decision was his own, not an external imposition.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: \"Sajan had decided to give in to Rajan’s request to work with him.\" This is directly contradicted by Sajan's explanation that he \"preferred to work independently.\"",
        "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: \"Rajan had believed that Sajan and he would be working together.\" This statement perfectly aligns with the inference from Step 2, as Rajan's unhappiness is a logical consequence of his expectation of collaboration being unmet.",
