If weight $W$ is reduced by 10%, new weight $W' = 0.9W$. New distance $s_{LO}' \\propto (0.9W)^2 = 0.81W^2$. Therefore, $s_{LO}' = 0.81 s_{LO}$, representing a 19% decrease. The magnitude of the percentage change is 19%. This matches the official answer range of 18-20%."

        "Identify the governing relationship for lift-off distance. The simplified lift-off distance ($s_{LO}$) is given by the formula $s_{LO} = \\frac{1.44W^2}{g \\rho S C_{L,max} T}$. From this, it is established that lift-off distance is proportional to the square of the aircraft's weight ($W$), i.e., $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$, assuming all other parameters ($g, \\rho, S, C_{L,max}, T$) remain constant.",
        "Define initial and new conditions. Let the initial weight be $W_{initial}$ and the initial lift-off distance be $s_{LO,initial}$. The take-off weight is reduced by 10%, so the new weight is $W_{new} = W_{initial} - 0.10W_{initial} = 0.9W_{initial}$.",
        "Calculate the new lift-off distance. Using the proportionality $s_{LO} \\propto W^2$, the new lift-off distance $s_{LO,new}$ will be proportional to $(W_{new})^2$. Thus, $s_{LO,new} \\propto (0.9W_{initial})^2 = 0.81 W_{initial}^2$. This means $s_{LO,new} = 0.81 s_{LO,initial}$.",
        "Calculate the percentage change. The percentage change in lift-off distance is calculated using the formula: Percentage Change = $\\frac{s_{LO,new} - s_{LO,initial}}{s_{LO,initial}} \\times 100\\%$.",
        "Substitute and compute. Substitute $s_{LO,new} = 0.81 s_{LO,initial}$ into the percentage change formula: Percentage Change = $\\frac{0.81 s_{LO,initial} - s_{LO,initial}}{s_{LO,initial}} \\times 100\\% = (0.81 - 1) \\times 100\\% = -0.19 \\times 100\\% = -19\\%$.",
