      "reasoning": "The static thrust (F_s) of an air-breathing engine is fundamentally linked to the energy conversion from fuel to propulsive work. The thermal efficiency (eta_th) of the engine quantifies this conversion.\n1.  **Heat Input Rate:** The rate at which chemical energy is supplied by the fuel is given by \\dot{Q}_{in} = \\dot{m}_f H_c, where \\dot{m}_f is the fuel mass flow rate and H_c is the heat of combustion (calorific value) of the fuel.\n2.  **Propulsive Power:** For static conditions (take-off, where flight velocity V_a = 0), the useful propulsive power imparted to the exhaust jet is approximately \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_e V_e^2, where \\dot{m}_e is the exhaust mass flow rate and V_e is the exhaust velocity.\n3.  **Static Thrust Definition:** Static thrust is also defined as F_s = \\dot{m}_e V_e (neglecting pressure thrust and assuming fuel-air ratio f \\ll 1, so \\dot{m}_e \\approx \\dot{m}_a). From this, we can express \\dot{m}_e = \\frac{F_s}{V_e}.\n4.  **Relating Propulsive Power to Thrust:** Substitute \\dot{m}_e into the propulsive power expression: Propulsive Power = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{F_s}{V_e}\\right) V_e^2 = \\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e.\n5.  **Thermal Efficiency Equation:** By definition, thermal efficiency is the ratio of propulsive power to heat input rate:\n    \\eta_{th} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}\n6.  **Solving for Static Thrust:** Rearranging the equation to solve for F_s:\n    F_s = \\frac{2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c}{V_e}\nThe question states that the fuel flow rate (\\dot{m}_f) and thermal efficiency (\\eta_{th}) are 'given' (i.e., constant). Also, 'burning aviation turbine fuel' implies that the heat of combustion (H_c) is constant. Therefore, all terms in the numerator (2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c) are constant.\nThis leads to the conclusion that F_s \\propto \\frac{1}{V_e}, meaning static thrust is inversely proportional to the exhaust velocity. This matches option B."

        "Identify the problem context: The question asks for the relationship between static thrust and exhaust velocity for a jet engine with constant fuel flow rate and thermal efficiency. Static thrust implies flight velocity $V_a = 0$.",
        "Recall the definition of thermal efficiency for a jet engine: $\\eta_{th} = \\frac{\\text{Useful Propulsive Power}}{\\text{Heat Input from Fuel}}$.",
        "Express the rate of heat input from the fuel: $\\dot{Q}_{in} = \\dot{m}_f H_c$, where $\\dot{m}_f$ is the fuel mass flow rate and $H_c$ is the heat of combustion (calorific value).",
        "For static conditions, the useful propulsive power can be expressed as the kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust stream, which is related to thrust. Specifically, $\\text{Propulsive Power} = \\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e$, where $F_s$ is the static thrust and $V_e$ is the exhaust velocity. This is derived from the thrust definition $F_s = \\dot{m}_e V_e$ and the kinetic energy of the exhaust $\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_e V_e^2$.",
        "Substitute these expressions into the thermal efficiency equation: $\\eta_{th} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_s V_e}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$.",
        "Rearrange this equation to solve for the static thrust, $F_s$: $F_s = \\frac{2 \\eta_{th} \\dot{m}_f H_c}{V_e}$.",
        "Analyze the derived relationship. Since $\\eta_{th}$, $\\dot{m}_f$, and $H_c$ are constant as per the problem statement, the static thrust ($F_s$) is inversely proportional to the exhaust velocity ($V_e$). That is, $F_s \\propto \\frac{1}{V_e}$."

This rigorous approach leads to the same derived formula.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and a more comprehensive analysis without relying on simplifying assumptions. Less prone to memorization errors. Cons: More time-consuming and complex for an exam setting. Requires careful handling of assumptions and a deeper understanding of engine thermodynamics.",
        "when_to_use": "For academic derivations, problem-solving when the direct formula is forgotten, or for a comprehensive understanding of engine performance."
