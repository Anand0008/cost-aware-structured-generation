The provided image clearly shows a closed path that does not encircle the central vortex core. Since the flow outside the core of a line vortex is irrotational, the net circulation along this path must be zero, as per Stokes' theorem or Kelvin's circulation theorem."

        "Recall the definition of circulation (Γ) as the line integral of the velocity vector (V) around a closed curve (C): Γ = ∮_C V ⋅ dl.",
        "For a potential line vortex, the velocity field is purely tangential, given by V = v_θ e_θ = (Γ / (2πr)) e_θ, where Γ is the vortex strength and r is the radial distance from the vortex core.",
        "A key property of a potential line vortex is that the flow is irrotational (i.e., vorticity ∇ × V = 0) everywhere outside its central core (singularity).",
        "According to Stokes' Theorem, the circulation (Γ) around a closed curve (C) is equal to the surface integral of the vorticity (∇ × V) over any surface (S) bounded by that curve: Γ = ∮_C V ⋅ dl = ∬_S (∇ × V) ⋅ dS.",
        "The closed path A-B-C-D-A shown in the figure does not enclose the vortex core. Therefore, the entire area enclosed by this path lies within the irrotational region of the flow.",
        "Since the vorticity (∇ × V) is zero everywhere within the area enclosed by the path A-B-C-D-A, the surface integral of vorticity is zero. Consequently, by Stokes' Theorem, the circulation along the path A-B-C-D-A is zero.",
        "Alternatively, the circulation can be calculated by directly integrating ∮_C V ⋅ dl along the path A-B-C-D-A. The path consists of two radial segments (A-B and C-D) and two tangential (circular arc) segments (B-C and D-A).",
        "For the radial segments (A-B and C-D), the velocity vector V is tangential (e_θ), and the displacement vector dl is radial (dr e_r). Since e_θ ⋅ e_r = 0, the dot product V ⋅ dl = 0. Thus, the contribution to circulation from segments A-B and C-D is zero.",
        "For the tangential segments (B-C and D-A), the displacement vector is dl = r dθ e_θ. The dot product is V ⋅ dl = (Γ / (2πr)) (r dθ) = (Γ / (2π)) dθ. Integrating along B-C (from θ_A to θ_C) gives (Γ / (2π))(θ_C - θ_A). Integrating along D-A (from θ_C to θ_A) gives (Γ / (2π))(θ_A - θ_C). Summing these contributions: Γ_path = (Γ / (2π))(θ_C - θ_A) + (Γ / (2π))(θ_A - θ_C) = 0."
