For a stationary aircraft parked in a hangar, the aircraft is in static equilibrium. The upward vertical ground reaction force ($R_z$) from the landing gear exactly balances the downward force of gravity (its weight, $W$). Therefore, $R_z = W$. Using the definition of vertical load factor, $n_z = R_z / W = W / W = 1$. This indicates the aircraft is experiencing its normal weight."
