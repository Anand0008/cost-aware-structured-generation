        "Analyze the effect of decreasing $M$ for a fixed $\theta$: The question asks what happens to $\beta$ when $M$ decreases while $\theta$ (the corner angle) remains constant.",
        "Consult `theta-beta-M` diagram behavior: For a fixed $\theta$, as the upstream Mach number $M$ decreases, the shock wave angle $\beta$ *increases* for both the weak and strong shock solutions. This means the shock becomes steeper relative to the incoming flow.",
        "Relate to weak and strong shocks: This increase in $\beta$ applies universally to both the weak and strong branches of the $\theta-\beta-M$ curve. A decrease in $M$ effectively makes the shock 'stronger' in terms of its intensity and inclination for a given deflection.",
