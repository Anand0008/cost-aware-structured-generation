      "reasoning": "The question describes an experiment where bubbles are injected at a fixed point (point A) at regular intervals (every 10 ms). These bubbles act as tracer particles. The curved line AB represents the instantaneous positions of all these bubbles that have passed through point A at various earlier times. According to the definitions:\n\n1.  **Pathline**: A pathline is the actual trajectory traced by a *single* fluid particle over a period. The line AB shows multiple particles at a single instant, not the history of one particle. Therefore, it is not a pathline.\n2.  **Streamline**: A streamline is a curve drawn in the fluid such that the velocity vector at any point on the curve is tangent to it *at that instant*. It provides an instantaneous picture of the flow field. However, the problem explicitly states 'unsteady separated flow'. In an unsteady flow, streamlines change with time, and they are generally distinct from pathlines and streaklines. The line AB is formed by particles released at different times, not necessarily tangent to the instantaneous velocity field everywhere along its length.\n3.  **Streakline**: A streakline connects *all the fluid particles that have previously passed through a single, fixed point in space*. The description perfectly matches this definition: bubbles are continuously injected from point A (a fixed point), and the line AB shows the instantaneous locus of these particles that originated from A. This is analogous to smoke from a chimney or dye injected into a flow.\n\nSince the flow is unsteady, pathlines, streamlines, and streaklines are generally distinct. The method of injecting particles from a fixed point over time to form a visible line is the direct experimental method for visualizing a streakline. Thus, the curved line AB represents only a streakline."

        "Understand the experimental setup: Bubbles are injected at a fixed point A at regular intervals (10 ms) into an unsteady separated flow. These bubbles act as tracer particles and follow the flow faithfully. Recall the definitions of key fluid flow visualization concepts: A pathline is the trajectory of a single fluid particle over time. A streamline is an instantaneous curve everywhere tangent to the local velocity vector. A streakline is the locus of all particles that have passed through a fixed point in space at earlier times.",
        "Understand the experimental setup and flow conditions. Bubbles are injected from a fixed point A at regular time intervals into an unsteady separated flow. This 'unsteady' condition is crucial because it implies that pathlines, streamlines, and streaklines are generally distinct.",
        "Recall the definitions of flow visualization lines: A pathline traces the trajectory of a single fluid particle. A streamline is an instantaneous curve everywhere tangent to the velocity vector field. A streakline is the instantaneous locus of all fluid particles that have passed through a fixed point in space.",
        "Analyze the observed line AB. It is formed by connecting multiple bubbles that were injected from the fixed point A at different earlier times, observed at a single instant. This directly matches the definition of a streakline.",
        "Rule out other possibilities. Since the flow is unsteady, pathlines, streamlines, and streaklines are generally distinct. The line AB is not a pathline because it shows multiple particles at one instant, not the trajectory of a single particle. It is not a streamline because it is formed by tracing particles over time, not by being tangent to the instantaneous velocity field.",
        "Conclude that given the continuous injection from a fixed point and the unsteady nature of the flow, the observed line AB can only be a streakline."
