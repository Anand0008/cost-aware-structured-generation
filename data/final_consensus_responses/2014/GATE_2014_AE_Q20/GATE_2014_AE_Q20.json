      "reasoning": "The retrieved knowledge consistently states that for an ideal turbojet engine with a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (TET), increasing the compressor pressure ratio ($\\pi_c$) initially increases specific thrust (and thus thrust) due to improved thermal efficiency and greater expansion potential. However, beyond an optimum pressure ratio, the specific thrust starts to decrease. This is because a larger portion of the available energy from the fixed TET is consumed by the increasing compressor work, leaving less energy for conversion into kinetic energy in the nozzle. Therefore, the thrust first increases and then decreases with increasing compressor pressure ratio."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the System and Key Variables. The system is an ideal turbojet engine. The key variable is the compressor pressure ratio (\\pi_c = P_{02}/P_{01}). A crucial constraint is a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (TET or T_{03}). The objective is to analyze the effect of increasing \\pi_c on engine thrust.",
        "Analyze the Effect of \\pi_c on Compressor Discharge Temperature (T_{02}). As \\pi_c increases, the compressor discharge temperature (T_{02}) increases according to the isentropic compression relation: T_{02} = T_{01} (\\pi_c)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}.",
        "Analyze the Impact on Combustor Heat Addition and Fuel Flow. With a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature (T_{03}), an increasing T_{02} means the temperature rise across the combustor (T_{03} - T_{02}) decreases. This implies less heat addition per unit mass flow rate (Q_{in} = c_p (T_{03} - T_{02})), leading to lower fuel consumption and generally higher thermal efficiency.",
        "Evaluate Compressor and Turbine Work Balance. Compressor work (W_c = c_p (T_{02} - T_{01})) increases with increasing \\pi_c. For an ideal turbojet, the turbine must produce this work (W_t = W_c = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04})), which implies that T_{04} (turbine exit temperature) must decrease.",
        "Relate Changes to Thrust Generation (Initial Increase). Initially, as \\pi_c increases, the overall pressure ratio of the cycle increases. This leads to higher thermal efficiency and greater expansion potential in the nozzle. This results in a higher exhaust velocity (V_e) and thus increased thrust (F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_a) + (P_e - P_a)A_e).",
        "Identify the Point of Diminishing Returns (Thrust Decrease). Beyond an optimum \\pi_c, the compressor work becomes so large that it consumes a significant fraction of the energy available from the fixed T_{03}. Although thermal efficiency might still be improving, the energy remaining for conversion into kinetic energy in the nozzle (lower T_{04}) starts to decrease. This reduction in exhaust energy dominates, leading to a decrease in exhaust velocity and consequently, a decrease in net thrust.",
        "Conclude the Overall Trend. The specific thrust (and total thrust) of a turbojet engine, for a fixed Turbine Entry Temperature, first increases with increasing compressor pressure ratio, reaches an optimum, and then decreases."
