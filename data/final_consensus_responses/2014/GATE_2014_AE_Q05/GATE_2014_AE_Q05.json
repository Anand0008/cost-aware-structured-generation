      "reasoning": "The question asks for the value of the integral `I = integral from 0 to 1 of 1000 x^4 dx` using Simpson's 1/3 rule with 2 equally spaced intervals.\n\n1.  **Identify the function and interval:**\n    `f(x) = 1000x^4`\n    Integration interval `[a, b] = [0, 1]`\n\n2.  **Determine the number of intervals and step size:**\n    Number of equally spaced intervals `N = 2`.\n    Step size `h = (b - a) / N = (1 - 0) / 2 = 0.5`.\n\n3.  **Identify the points for evaluation:**\n    For `N=2` intervals, we need `N+1 = 3` points:\n    `x_0 = a = 0`\n    `x_1 = a + h = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5`\n    `x_2 = a + 2h = 0 + 2(0.5) = 1`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the function at these points:**\n    `f(x_0) = f(0) = 1000 * (0)^4 = 0`\n    `f(x_1) = f(0.5) = 1000 * (0.5)^4 = 1000 * (1/16) = 62.5`\n    `f(x_2) = f(1) = 1000 * (1)^4 = 1000`\n\n5.  **Apply Simpson's 1/3 Rule formula:**\n    The formula for Simpson's 1/3 rule for a single application over two intervals is:\n    `I_approx = (h/3) * (f(x_0) + 4*f(x_1) + f(x_2))`\n\n6.  **Substitute the values and calculate:**\n    `I_approx = (0.5/3) * (0 + 4 * 62.5 + 1000)`\n    `I_approx = (0.5/3) * (0 + 250 + 1000)`\n    `I_approx = (0.5/3) * (1250)`\n    `I_approx = 625 / 3`\n    `I_approx = 208.333...`\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value `208.333...` is closest to option D. 208.\n\nNote: The exact analytical integral is `Integral from 0 to 1 of 1000 x^4 dx = 1000 * [x^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1000 * (1/5 - 0) = 200`. Simpson's 1/3 rule is an approximation, and for a 4th-degree polynomial, it is not exact, hence the difference between the approximate value (208.333...) and the exact value (200)."
