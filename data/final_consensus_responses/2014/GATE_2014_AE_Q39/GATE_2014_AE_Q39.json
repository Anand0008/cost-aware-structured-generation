Then, the ratio of their masses is calculated.\n\n1.  **Maximum Shear Stress for Design I (Solid Shaft):**\n    For a solid circular shaft of diameter $d_s$, the maximum shear stress is given by:\n    $\\tau_{max,1} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d_s^3}$\n    Given $d_s = 30\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n2.  **Maximum Shear Stress for Design II (Thin-Walled Circular Shaft):**\n    For a thin-walled circular shaft with average diameter $D_{avg}$ and wall thickness $t$, the maximum shear stress is approximately:\n    $\\tau_{max,2} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi D_{avg}^2 t}$\n    Given $D_{avg} = 40\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n3.  **Equate Maximum Shear Stresses to find thickness $t$:**\n    Since $\\tau_{max,1} = \\tau_{max,2}$:\n    $\\frac{16T}{\\pi d_s^3} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi D_{avg}^2 t}$\n    Cancel $T$ and $\\pi$ from both sides:\n    $\\frac{16}{d_s^3} = \\frac{2}{D_{avg}^2 t}$\n    Solving for $t$:\n    $t = \\frac{2 d_s^3}{16 D_{avg}^2} = \\frac{d_s^3}{8 D_{avg}^2}$\n    Substitute the given values:\n    $t = \\frac{(30\\,\\text{mm})^3}{8 \\times (40\\,\\text{mm})^2} = \\frac{27000}{8 \\times 1600} = \\frac{27000}{12800} = 2.109375\\,\\text{mm}$\n\n4.  **Calculate Cross-sectional Areas:**\n    *   **Area of Design I (Solid Shaft):**\n        $A_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_s^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (30\\,\\text{mm})^2 = 225\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2$\n    *   **Area of Design II (Thin-Walled Hollow Shaft):**\n        For a thin-walled section, the cross-sectional area is approximately the circumference of the mean diameter multiplied by the thickness:\n        $A_2 = \\pi D_{avg} t = \\pi (40\\,\\text{mm}) (2.109375\\,\\text{mm}) = 84.375\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2$\n\n5.  **Ratio of Masses:**\n    Since both shafts have the same length $l$ and are made of the same material (implying the same density $\\rho$), the ratio of their masses is equal to the ratio of their cross-sectional areas:\n    $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{\\rho A_1 l}{\\rho A_2 l} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}$\n    $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{225\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2}{84.375\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^2} = \\frac{225}{84.375} \\approx 2.6666...$\n\nThis ratio can also be found directly using the simplified expression derived from the previous steps: $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{2 D_{avg}}{d_s} = \\frac{2 \\times 40}{30} = \\frac{80}{30} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667$.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is $2.67$ or $2.68$.

        "Identify the given parameters and conditions. Design I is a solid circular shaft with diameter $d_s = 30$ mm. Design II is a thin-walled circular shaft with an average diameter $D = 40$ mm. Both shafts carry the same torque $T$, have the same length $L$, are made of the same material (same density $\\rho$), and experience the same maximum shear stress $\\tau_{max}$.",
        "Write down the formulas for maximum shear stress for both shaft designs. For a solid circular shaft (Design I): $\\tau_{max,s} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d_s^3}$. For a thin-walled circular shaft (Design II): $\\tau_{max,t} = \\frac{T}{2 A_m t}$, where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line. For a circular shaft with average diameter $D$, $A_m = \\pi (D/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$. So, $\\tau_{max,t} = \\frac{T}{2 (\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}) t} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi D^2 t}$.",
        "Equate the maximum shear stresses for both designs, as given in the problem statement ($\\tau_{max,s} = \\tau_{max,t}$). This yields $\\frac{16T}{\\pi d_s^3} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi D^2 t}$. Cancel $T$ and $\\pi$ from both sides: $\\frac{16}{d_s^3} = \\frac{2}{D^2 t}$.",
        "Solve for the wall thickness $t$ of the thin-walled shaft (Design II): $t = \\frac{2 d_s^3}{16 D^2} = \\frac{d_s^3}{8 D^2}$. Substitute the given values: $d_s = 30$ mm and $D = 40$ mm. $t = \\frac{(30 \\text{ mm})^3}{8 (40 \\text{ mm})^2} = \\frac{27000}{8 \\times 1600} = \\frac{27000}{12800} = 2.109375$ mm.",
        "Calculate the cross-sectional area for Design I (solid shaft): $A_s = \\frac{\\pi d_s^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (30 \\text{ mm})^2}{4} = 225\\pi \\text{ mm}^2$.",
        "Calculate the cross-sectional area for Design II (thin-walled hollow shaft). For a thin-walled circular shaft, the area can be approximated as $A_t = \\pi D t$. $A_t = \\pi (40 \\text{ mm}) (2.109375 \\text{ mm}) = 84.375\\pi \\text{ mm}^2$.",
        "Determine the ratio of the mass of Design I to the mass of Design II. Since mass $m = \\rho A L$, and $\\rho$ (density) and $L$ (length) are the same for both shafts, the ratio of masses is equal to the ratio of their cross-sectional areas: $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{A_s}{A_t} = \\frac{225\\pi \\text{ mm}^2}{84.375\\pi \\text{ mm}^2} = \\frac{225}{84.375} \\approx 2.6667$.",
        "Alternatively, substitute the symbolic expression for $t$ into the area ratio: $\\frac{A_s}{A_t} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi d_s^2}{4}}{\\pi D t} = \\frac{d_s^2}{4 D t} = \\frac{d_s^2}{4 D (\\frac{d_s^3}{8 D^2})} = \\frac{d_s^2}{4 D} \\times \\frac{8 D^2}{d_s^3} = \\frac{2 D}{d_s}$. Using this simplified formula: $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{2 \\times 40 \\text{ mm}}{30 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{80}{30} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667$.",
