      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the terminal velocity of a two-stage rocket, neglecting drag and gravity effects. This implies the use of the ideal Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. The key steps involve correctly distributing the total mass and payload between the two stages using the given structural coefficient and the condition that both stages have the same 'payload ratio'.\n\n1.  **Interpret Payload Ratio for Optimal Staging:** The condition 'both stages with same payload ratio' for a two-stage rocket with identical specific impulse and structural coefficient implies an optimal staging configuration. This means the initial mass of the second stage ($M_{i2}$) is the geometric mean of the total initial mass ($M_{i1}$) and the final payload mass ($M_L$).\n    $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{M_{i1} M_L}$\n    Given $M_{i1} = 16000$ kg and $M_L = 1000$ kg:\n    $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{16000 \\times 1000} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 10^6} = 4000$ kg.\n\n2.  **Determine Propellant and Structural Masses for Each Stage:**\n    *   The total mass of Stage 1 (propellant + structure) is the difference between the initial mass of the rocket and the initial mass of the second stage:\n        $M_{p1} + M_{s1} = M_{i1} - M_{i2} = 16000 - 4000 = 12000$ kg.\n    *   The total mass of Stage 2 (propellant + structure) is the difference between the initial mass of the second stage and the final payload mass:\n        $M_{p2} + M_{s2} = M_{i2} - M_L = 4000 - 1000 = 3000$ kg.\n    *   The structural coefficient $\\epsilon = 0.14$ is defined as $M_s / (M_s + M_p)$. This can be rearranged to find $M_s$ in terms of $M_p$: $M_s = \\frac{\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon} M_p$.\n        $M_s = \\frac{0.14}{1-0.14} M_p = \\frac{0.14}{0.86} M_p \\approx 0.16279 M_p$.\n    *   **For Stage 1:**\n        $M_{s1} + M_{p1} = 12000 \\implies 0.16279 M_{p1} + M_{p1} = 12000 \\implies 1.16279 M_{p1} = 12000$\n        $M_{p1} = \\frac{12000}{1.16279} \\approx 10320.0$ kg\n        $M_{s1} = 12000 - 10320.0 = 1680.0$ kg\n    *   **For Stage 2:**\n        $M_{s2} + M_{p2} = 3000 \\implies 0.16279 M_{p2} + M_{p2} = 3000 \\implies 1.16279 M_{p2} = 3000$\n        $M_{p2} = \\frac{3000}{1.16279} \\approx 2580.0$ kg\n        $M_{s2} = 3000 - 2580.0 = 420.0$ kg\n\n3.  **Calculate Mass Ratios ($R$) for Each Stage:**\n    The mass ratio for a stage is $R = M_{initial} / M_{final}$.\n    *   **For Stage 1:**\n        $M_{initial,1} = M_{i1} = 16000$ kg.\n        $M_{final,1} = M_{initial,1} - M_{p1} = 16000 - 10320 = 5680$ kg.\n        $R_1 = \\frac{16000}{5680} = \\frac{200}{71} \\approx 2.8169$.\n    *   **For Stage 2:**\n        $M_{initial,2} = M_{i2} = 4000$ kg.\n        $M_{final,2} = M_{initial,2} - M_{p2} = 4000 - 2580 = 1420$ kg.\n        $R_2 = \\frac{4000}{1420} = \\frac{200}{71} \\approx 2.8169$.\n    (Note: $R_1 = R_2$, which is characteristic of optimal staging under these conditions).\n\n4.  **Apply Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation for Each Stage:**\n    The ideal exhaust velocity $V_e = I_{sp} g_0 = 300 \\text{ s} \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 2940$ m/s.\n    The velocity change for each stage is $\\Delta V = V_e \\ln(R)$.\n    *   $\\Delta V_1 = 2940 \\times \\ln(200/71) \\approx 2940 \\times 1.03570085 \\approx 3044.57$ m/s.\n    *   $\\Delta V_2 = 2940 \\times \\ln(200/71) \\approx 2940 \\times 1.03570085 \\approx 3044.57$ m/s.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Terminal Velocity:**\n    The total terminal velocity is the sum of the velocity changes from each stage:\n    $\\Delta V_{total} = \\Delta V_1 + \\Delta V_2 = 3044.57 + 3044.57 = 6089.14$ m/s.\n\nThis calculated value of $6089.14$ m/s falls within the specified range of $6050$ to $6250$ m/s."

Note the initial mass ($M_0 = 16000$ kg), payload mass ($M_L = 1000$ kg), specific impulse ($I_{sp} = 300$ s), structural coefficient ($\\epsilon = 0.14$), and gravitational acceleration ($g_0 = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$). Crucially, recognize the 'neglecting drag and gravity effects' assumption, which simplifies the problem to the ideal Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.",
        "Step 2: Determine Optimal Staging Mass for the Second Stage. For a two-stage rocket with identical specific impulse and structural coefficient, the condition for optimal staging (maximizing total $\\Delta V$) when the 'payload ratio' is the same for both stages is given by $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{M_{i1} M_L}$. Calculate $M_{i2} = \\sqrt{16000 \\times 1000} = 4000$ kg.",
        "Step 3: Calculate Total Propellant and Structural Mass for Each Stage. The total mass of Stage 1 (propellant + structure) is $M_{p1} + M_{s1} = M_{i1} - M_{i2} = 16000 - 4000 = 12000$ kg. The total mass of Stage 2 (propellant + structure) is $M_{p2} + M_{s2} = M_{i2} - M_L = 4000 - 1000 = 3000$ kg.",
        "Step 4: Calculate Individual Propellant and Structural Masses for Each Stage. Use the structural coefficient definition $\\epsilon = M_s / (M_s + M_p)$. Given $\\epsilon = 0.14$, we have $M_s = 0.14 (M_s + M_p)$, which implies $M_s = \\frac{0.14}{1-0.14} M_p = \\frac{0.14}{0.86} M_p \\approx 0.16279 M_p$. For Stage 1: $M_{s1} + M_{p1} = 12000$ kg. Substituting $M_{s1} = 0.16279 M_{p1}$, we get $0.16279 M_{p1} + M_{p1} = 12000 \\implies 1.16279 M_{p1} = 12000 \\implies M_{p1} \\approx 10320$ kg. Then $M_{s1} = 12000 - 10320 = 1680$ kg. For Stage 2: $M_{s2} + M_{p2} = 3000$ kg. Substituting $M_{s2} = 0.16279 M_{p2}$, we get $1.16279 M_{p2} = 3000 \\implies M_{p2} \\approx 2580$ kg. Then $M_{s2} = 3000 - 2580 = 420$ kg.",
        "Step 5: Calculate Mass Ratios for Each Stage. The mass ratio for a stage is $R = M_{initial} / M_{final}$ (where $M_{final}$ is the mass after propellant burn, but before stage separation). For Stage 1: $M_{initial,1} = 16000$ kg. $M_{final,1} = M_{initial,1} - M_{p1} = 16000 - 10320 = 5680$ kg. So, $R_1 = 16000 / 5680 \\approx 2.8169$. For Stage 2: $M_{initial,2} = 4000$ kg. $M_{final,2} = M_{initial,2} - M_{p2} = 4000 - 2580 = 1420$ kg. So, $R_2 = 4000 / 1420 \\approx 2.8169$.",
        "Step 6: Apply Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation to Each Stage. Calculate the ideal exhaust velocity $V_e = I_{sp} g_0 = 300 \\times 9.8 = 2940$ m/s. Calculate the velocity change for each stage: $\\Delta V_1 = V_e \\ln(R_1) = 2940 \\times \\ln(2.8169) \\approx 3044.57$ m/s. $\\Delta V_2 = V_e \\ln(R_2) = 2940 \\times \\ln(2.8169) \\approx 3044.57$ m/s.",
