      "reasoning": "To measure the free-stream velocity ($V$) in a low-speed (incompressible) flow, the fundamental relationship derived from Bernoulli's equation is $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p_0 - p)}{\\rho}}$, where $p_0$ is the total (stagnation) pressure, $p$ is the static pressure, and $\\rho$ is the air density. Therefore, to determine $V$, both $p_0$ and $p$ must be known.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\ni. **Pitot tube alone aligned with the flow direction:** A Pitot tube measures only the total pressure ($p_0$). Without a separate measurement of static pressure ($p$), the velocity cannot be determined. Thus, statement (i) is incorrect.\n\nii. **Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction with static pressure measurement at an appropriate position on the tunnel wall:** A Pitot tube measures $p_0$. A static pressure port on the tunnel wall, if placed at an 'appropriate position' where the flow is undisturbed, measures $p$. With both $p_0$ and $p$ available, the velocity can be calculated. Thus, statement (ii) is correct.\n\niii. **Pitot tube aligned with the flow direction along with barometer pressure reading of the outside ambient:** A Pitot tube measures $p_0$. A barometer measures the atmospheric pressure outside the wind tunnel. This outside ambient pressure is generally not the static pressure ($p$) within the wind tunnel test section, especially in a closed-circuit tunnel or if there are pressure gradients. Therefore, this combination is not reliable for measuring test section velocity. Thus, statement (iii) is incorrect.\n\niv. **Pitot static tube alone aligned with the flow direction:** A Pitot-static tube is a single instrument designed to measure both total pressure ($p_0$) from its forward-facing opening and static pressure ($p$) from its side-facing static ports simultaneously. With both $p_0$ and $p$ directly measured by the instrument, the velocity can be calculated. Thus, statement (iv) is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements (ii) and (iv) are correct, making option C the right choice."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: To measure free-stream velocity ($V$) in a low-speed (incompressible) wind tunnel, we rely on Bernoulli's principle, which states that $p + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 = p_0$. From this, the velocity can be determined if both the total (stagnation) pressure ($p_0$) and the static pressure ($p$) are known, using the formula $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p_0 - p)}{\\rho}}$.",
        "Step 2: Recall that to determine freestream velocity in incompressible flow, both total (stagnation) pressure ($p_0$) and static pressure ($p_1$ or $p$) are required, typically using Bernoulli's equation. A Pitot tube measures total pressure, while a static port measures static pressure.",
        "Step 3: Analyze statement (i) - 'Pitot tube alone'. A Pitot tube measures only total (stagnation) pressure ($p_0$). Without a separate measurement for static pressure ($p_1$ or $p$), the dynamic pressure ($p_0 - p_1$) cannot be determined, and thus the freestream velocity cannot be calculated. Therefore, statement (i) is incorrect.",
        "Step 4: Analyze statement (ii) - 'Pitot tube with static pressure measurement on the tunnel wall'. A Pitot tube measures total pressure ($p_0$), and a static pressure port on the tunnel wall (at an appropriate, undisturbed location) measures the static pressure ($p_1$ or $p$). With both $p_0$ and $p_1$ available, the freestream velocity can be calculated. Therefore, statement (ii) is correct.",
        "Step 5: Analyze statement (iii) - 'Pitot tube with barometer pressure reading of the outside ambient'. While a Pitot tube measures total pressure ($p_0$), a barometer measures the ambient atmospheric pressure outside the wind tunnel. This outside ambient pressure is generally not the static pressure inside the wind tunnel test section, especially for closed-circuit tunnels or due to tunnel losses. Therefore, this method is not reliable for accurate velocity measurement, and statement (iii) is incorrect.",
        "Step 6: Analyze statement (iv) - 'Pitot static tube alone'. A Pitot-static tube is a single, combined instrument designed to measure both total (stagnation) pressure ($p_0$) from its forward-facing opening and static pressure ($p_1$ or $p$) from its side ports. Since it provides both necessary pressure measurements, the freestream velocity can be directly calculated. Therefore, statement (iv) is correct.",
        "Step 7: Based on the analysis, statements (ii) and (iv) are correct methods for determining freestream velocity. Therefore, the correct option is C."

This is fundamental for validating CFD simulations and understanding aerodynamic phenomena. For instance, before testing an aircraft model, technicians use a calibrated Pitot-static traverse to map the velocity profile in the test section.",
        "why_it_matters": "Accurate flow velocity measurement ensures that experimental results are reliable and can be correctly scaled to real-world flight conditions. If static pressure is mis-measured, all derived aerodynamic coefficients can be systematically wrong, affecting design decisions and the accuracy of force and moment data."

Scan for keywords like 'Pitot', 'Pitot-static', 'static pressure on tunnel wall', and be wary of 'barometer' for internal tunnel static pressure.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, eliminate options that only provide one type of pressure (total or static) or use an irrelevant pressure source (like an outside ambient barometer). Focus on options that explicitly combine both total and static pressure measurements, such as a Pitot-static tube or separate Pitot tube and static wall tap.",

Cons: Fragile, requires frequent and careful calibration, sensitive to temperature changes and flow direction, can disturb the flow field, not suitable for high-speed or dirty flows, and requires more complex instrumentation.",

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Non-intrusive, very high accuracy, can measure velocity components, directional, and no calibration needed after initial setup. Cons: Expensive, complex setup, requires seeding the flow with tracer particles, and limited to optically transparent flows requiring optical access.",
