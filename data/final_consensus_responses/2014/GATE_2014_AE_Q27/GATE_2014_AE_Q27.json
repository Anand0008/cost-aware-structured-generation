For an odd function over a symmetric interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, the Fourier coefficients $a_0$ and $a_n$ are zero.\n\n1.  **Identify the function type:** $f(x)$ is an odd function (a square wave with amplitude 2).\n2.  **Calculate Fourier coefficients:**\n    *   $a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) dx = 0$ (integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval).\n    *   $a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(nx) dx = 0$ (product of odd $f(x)$ and even $\\cos(nx)$ is odd).\n    *   $b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$. Since $f(x)\\sin(nx)$ is an even function (odd $\\times$ odd = even), we can write:\n        $b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) dx$\n        For $0 < x < \\pi$, $f(x) = 2$.\n        $b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 2 \\sin(nx) dx = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(nx)}{n} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi}$\n        $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [-\\cos(n\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))] = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [1 - \\cos(n\\pi)]$\n        Since $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n$, we have:\n        $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} [1 - (-1)^n]$\n\n3.  **Determine $b_n$ for even and odd $n$:**\n    *   If $n$ is even (e.g., $n=2, 4, \\dots$), then $(-1)^n = 1$, so $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} (1 - 1) = 0$.\n    *   If $n$ is odd (e.g., $n=1, 3, 5, \\dots$), then $(-1)^n = -1$, so $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} (1 - (-1)) = \\frac{8}{\\pi n}$.\n\n4.  **Write the Fourier series:**\n    $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1, n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx) = \\sum_{n=1, n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{\\pi n} \\sin(nx)$\n    $f(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(x)}{1} + \\frac{\\sin(3x)}{3} + \\frac{\\sin(5x)}{5} + \\dots \\right)$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the series at a specific point to find the sum $s$:**\n    The target sum is $s = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + \\dots$. This is the Leibniz formula for $\\pi/4$, which suggests evaluating the Fourier series at $x = \\pi/2$.\n    At $x = \\pi/2$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous, and $f(\\pi/2) = 2$.\n    Substitute $x = \\pi/2$ into the Fourier series:\n    $f(\\pi/2) = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\pi/2)}{1} + \\frac{\\sin(3\\pi/2)}{3} + \\frac{\\sin(5\\pi/2)}{5} + \\dots \\right)$\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{-1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{-1}{7} + \\dots \\right)$\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\dots \\right)$\n    The series in the parenthesis is exactly $s$.\n    $2 = \\frac{8}{\\pi} s$\n    $s = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the sum $s$ converges to $\\pi/4$."

        "Step 2: For an odd function with period 2π, the Fourier series contains only sine terms, meaning a₀ = 0 and aₙ = 0. The formula for bₙ simplifies to bₙ = (2/π) ∫₀^π f(x) sin(nx) dx.",
        "Step 3: Compute the bₙ coefficients. Since f(x) = 2 for 0 < x < π, substitute this into the integral: bₙ = (2/π) ∫₀^π 2 sin(nx) dx = (4/π) ∫₀^π sin(nx) dx.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate the integral for bₙ: bₙ = (4/(nπ)) [ -cos(nx) ]₀^π = (4/(nπ)) ( -cos(nπ) + cos(0) ) = (4/(nπ)) (1 - (-1)ⁿ).",
        "Step 5: Simplify bₙ. If n is even, (-1)ⁿ = 1, so bₙ = 0. If n is odd, (-1)ⁿ = -1, so bₙ = (4/(nπ)) (1 - (-1)) = 8/(nπ).",
        "Step 6: Write the Fourier series for f(x). Since bₙ is non-zero only for odd n, let n = 2k-1 (where k=1, 2, 3,...). Then f(x) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ (8/((2k-1)π)) sin((2k-1)x) = (8/π) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (1/(2k-1)) sin((2k-1)x).",
        "Step 7: To obtain the target series s = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ..., which is of the form Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^(k-1)/(2k-1), we need to evaluate the Fourier series at x = π/2, because sin((2k-1)π/2) = (-1)^(k-1).",
        "Step 8: Evaluate f(π/2) from the original function definition: f(π/2) = 2 (since 0 < π/2 < π). Substitute x = π/2 into the Fourier series: f(π/2) = (8/π) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (1/(2k-1)) sin((2k-1)π/2) = (8/π) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^(k-1)/(2k-1)."
