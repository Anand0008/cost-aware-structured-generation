      "reasoning": "The problem describes an inviscid, compressible flow over a thin airfoil where the local Mach number at point A (M_A) reaches 1.0, while the free-stream Mach number (M_inf) is subsonic. This scenario is characteristic of the critical Mach number concept. For such a flow, assuming it is isentropic (due to inviscid and no shocks mentioned at onset), the isentropic flow relations can be applied between the free-stream conditions and point A. The stagnation pressure (p_0) remains constant in an isentropic flow.\n\nThe isentropic pressure relation is given by:\np_0/p = (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M^2)^(gamma/(gamma-1))\n\nApplying this between the free-stream (denoted by inf) and point A, and noting that p_0 is constant:\np_A/p_inf = (p_A/p_0) / (p_inf/p_0) = [(1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M_inf^2)^(gamma/(gamma-1))] / [(1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M_A^2)^(gamma/(gamma-1))]\nThis can be rewritten as:\np_A/p_inf = [(1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M_inf^2) / (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M_A^2)]^(gamma/(gamma-1))\n\nGiven:\np_A/p_inf = 0.8\nM_A = 1.0\ngamma = 1.4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n0.8 = [(1 + (1.4-1)/2 * M_inf^2) / (1 + (1.4-1)/2 * (1.0)^2)]^(1.4/(1.4-1))\n0.8 = [(1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2) / (1 + 0.2)]^3.5\n0.8 = [(1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2) / 1.2]^3.5\n\nRearranging to solve for M_inf:\n(1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2)^3.5 = 0.8 * (1.2)^3.5\n\nCalculate (1.2)^3.5 = (1.2)^(7/2) = sqrt((1.2)^7) = sqrt(3.5831808) approx 1.892923\n\n(1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2)^3.5 = 0.8 * 1.892923 approx 1.5143384\n\nTake the 1/3.5 power (or 2/7 power) on both sides:\n1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2 = (1.5143384)^(1/3.5) = (1.5143384)^(2/7)\n1 + 0.2 * M_inf^2 approx 1.12000\n\n0.2 * M_inf^2 approx 0.12000\nM_inf^2 approx 0.6000\nM_inf approx sqrt(0.6000) approx 0.7746\n\nComparing this calculated value with the given options, option B (0.79) is the closest. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the options or the problem's design. The condition 'rest of the flow field is subsonic' also confirms that M_inf must be less than 1, which is satisfied by option B."

        "Understand the flow conditions: The flow is inviscid and compressible, and in the absence of shocks, it can be considered isentropic. This implies that the stagnation pressure ($p_0$) remains constant throughout the flow field.",

        "Apply this relation to both the free-stream conditions (denoted by $\\infty$) and the conditions at point A (critical point, where $M_A = 1.0$).\nFor freestream: $\\frac{p_{\\infty}}{p_0} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\nFor point A (critical): $\\frac{p_A}{p_0} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} (1)^2\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$.",
        "Form the ratio $\\frac{p_A}{p_{\\infty}}$ by dividing the two expressions from the previous step: $\\frac{p_A}{p_{\\infty}} = \\frac{p_A/p_0}{p_{\\infty}/p_0} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_A^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}}$.",
        "Substitute the given numerical values: $p_A/p_{\\infty} = 0.8$, $M_A = 1.0$, and $\\gamma = 1.4$.

        "Rearrange the equation to solve for $M_{\\infty}$: $(1 + 0.2 M_{\\infty}^2)^{3.5} = 0.8 \\times (1.2)^{3.5}$.\nCalculate $(1.2)^{3.5} \\approx 1.892923$. Then, $(1 + 0.2 M_{\\infty}^2)^{3.5} \\approx 0.8 \\times 1.892923 \\approx 1.5143384$.",
        "Take the $1/3.5$ power (or $2/7$ power) of both sides: $1 + 0.2 M_{\\infty}^2 = (1.5143384)^{1/3.5} \\approx 1.12000$.",
        "Solve for $M_{\\infty}$: $0.2 M_{\\infty}^2 = 1.12000 - 1 = 0.12000 \\implies M_{\\infty}^2 = 0.6000 \\implies M_{\\infty} \\approx 0.7746$. Compare this value with the given options and select the closest one, which is 0.79. This also confirms that $M_{\\infty} < 1$, consistent with the \"rest of the flow field is subsonic\" condition."
