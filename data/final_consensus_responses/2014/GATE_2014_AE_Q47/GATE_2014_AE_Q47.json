      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the overall total-to-total efficiency of a centrifugal compressor. This involves several steps:\n1.  Calculate the impeller blade tip speed (u2) from the given radius and rotational speed.\n2.  Determine the actual tangential component of air velocity at the blade tip (Vw2) using the given slip factor (σs = Vw2/u2).\n3.  Apply the Euler turbomachinery equation (wc = u2 * Vw2, noting axial inlet means Vw1 = 0) to find the specific work input to the compressor.\n4.  Calculate the actual stagnation temperature rise (ΔT0_actual) using the specific work input and specific heat capacity (cp = γR/(γ-1)).\n5.  Calculate the ideal (isentropic) stagnation temperature rise (ΔT0_isentropic) using the given stagnation pressure ratio and the isentropic relation.\n6.  Finally, compute the total-to-total efficiency (ηtt) as the ratio of the isentropic temperature rise to the actual temperature rise (ηtt = ΔT0_isentropic / ΔT0_actual).\nFollowing these steps yields an efficiency of approximately 75%, which is within the accepted range of 74-76%."
