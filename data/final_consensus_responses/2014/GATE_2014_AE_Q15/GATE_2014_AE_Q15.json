      "reasoning": "The fundamental natural frequency for torsional vibration of a uniform rod is determined by its boundary conditions. The general form of the natural frequency is $\\omega_n = \\frac{\\beta_n C}{L}$, where $C = \\sqrt{G/\\rho}$ is the torsional wave speed, $G$ is the shear modulus, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $L$ is the length, and $\\beta_n$ is a constant determined by the boundary conditions and mode number $n$.\n\n1.  **Fixed-Fixed Rod:**\n    For a fixed-fixed rod, the boundary conditions are zero twist at both ends: $\\theta(0,t) = 0$ and $\\theta(L,t) = 0$. Applying these to the general solution leads to the frequency equation $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$. This implies $\\frac{\\omega L}{C} = n\\pi$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n    The fundamental natural frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{ff} = \\frac{\\pi C}{L} = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}}$.\n\n2.  **Fixed-Free Rod:**\n    For a fixed-free rod, the boundary conditions are zero twist at the fixed end ($\\theta(0,t) = 0$) and zero torque at the free end ($\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}|_{x=L} = 0$). Applying these to the general solution leads to the frequency equation $\\cos(\\frac{\\omega L}{C}) = 0$. This implies $\\frac{\\omega L}{C} = (2n-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n    The fundamental natural frequency (for $n=1$) is $\\omega_{ffree} = \\frac{\\pi C}{2L} = \\frac{\\pi}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}}$.\n\n3.  **Ratio $k$:**\n    The value of $k$ is the ratio of the fundamental natural frequency of the fixed-fixed rod to that of the fixed-free rod:\n    $k = \\frac{\\omega_{ff}}{\\omega_{ffree}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}}}{\\frac{\\pi}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\times \\frac{2L}{1} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is 2."
