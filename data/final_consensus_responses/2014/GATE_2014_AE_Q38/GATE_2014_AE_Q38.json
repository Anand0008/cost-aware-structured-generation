      "reasoning": "The problem involves a simply supported beam with overhangs subjected to a concentrated load at the center of the main span. The magnitude of the slope at the tip of the overhang (S) is required.\n\n1.  **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):** For a rectangular cross-section with width $b = 10 \\text{ mm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}$ and height $h = 6 \\text{ mm} = 0.006 \\text{ m}$, the moment of inertia is $I = \\frac{bh^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.01 \\text{ m})(0.006 \\text{ m})^3}{12} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Flexural Rigidity (EI):** Given Young's Modulus $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, the flexural rigidity is $EI = (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2)(1.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4) = 36 \\text{ N m}^2$.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactions:** The beam has supports at Q and R, with a span $L_{span} = 1.2 \\text{ m}$. A 50 N load is applied at the center O of this span. Due to symmetry, the reactions at Q and R are $R_Q = R_R = \\frac{50 \\text{ N}}{2} = 25 \\text{ N}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze Overhang R-S:** The segment R-S is an overhang of length $0.3 \\text{ m}$. There are no external loads acting on this segment. Since there are no external loads and the free end S has zero bending moment, the bending moment is zero throughout the segment R-S. Consequently, the curvature $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{M}{EI} = 0$, which implies the slope is constant throughout the overhang R-S. Thus, the slope at tip S ($\\theta_S$) is equal to the slope at support R ($\\theta_R$).\n\n5.  **Calculate Slope at Support R ($\\theta_R$):** For a simply supported beam of length $L_{span}$ with a central concentrated load $P$, the magnitude of the slope at the supports is given by the formula: $\\theta_R = \\frac{P L_{span}^2}{16 E I}$.\n    $\\theta_R = \\frac{50 \\text{ N} \\times (1.2 \\text{ m})^2}{16 \\times 36 \\text{ N m}^2} = \\frac{50 \\times 1.44}{576} = \\frac{72}{576} = 0.125 \\text{ radians}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The magnitude of the slope at tip S is $0.125 \\text{ radians}$."

        "industry_example": "In aircraft wing design, calculating slope ensures that ailerons and wingtips do not deflect excessively under load, maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. Similarly, in steel bridge design, the slope of the bridge deck at supports is critical for stability and safety under heavy loads.",
        "why_it_matters": "Excessive slope can change the local angle of attack, affecting lift and control in aircraft, or indicate insufficient stiffness/damage. In civil structures, it can compromise stability and safety."

        "description": "The Moment-Area method involves computing the area of the M/EI diagram between supports to find the change in slope. For symmetric cases, the slope at a support is half the total area of the M/EI diagram between supports. This method provides an alternative approach to calculating the slope by integrating the M/EI diagram to determine the tangential deviation.",

For this problem, one could treat the beam as a simply supported beam (span 1.2 m) plus two cantilever beams (overhangs) with end moments from reactions. Since overhangs are unloaded, only the simply supported part contributes to the central load.",
