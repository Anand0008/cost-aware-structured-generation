      "reasoning": "The problem involves a damped single degree of freedom system and requires finding the damping factor using the half-power bandwidth method. The undamped natural frequency ($f_n = 10 \\text{ Hz}$) is first converted to angular frequency ($\\omega_n = 2\\pi f_n = 20\\pi \\text{ rad/s} \\approx 62.83185 \\text{ rad/s}$). The two given frequencies ($\\omega_1 = 60.9469 \\text{ rad/s}$ and $\\omega_2 = 64.7168 \\text{ rad/s}$) are the half-power points where the power dissipated is half of its maximum. For a lightly damped SDOF system, the damping ratio ($\\zeta$) is given by the half-power bandwidth formula: $\\zeta = \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{2\\omega_n}$. Substituting the values, $\\zeta = \\frac{64.7168 - 60.9469}{2 \\times 20\\pi} = \\frac{3.7699}{40\\pi} \\approx 0.029999$. Converting this to a percentage gives approximately 3.00%. This value falls within the typical acceptable range for such problems. The exact relation \\(\\omega_2^2 - \\omega_1^2 = 4\\zeta \\omega_n^2 \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}\\) also yields \\(\\zeta = 0.03\\)."
