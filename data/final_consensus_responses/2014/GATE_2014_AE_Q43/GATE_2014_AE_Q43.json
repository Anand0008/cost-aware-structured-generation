      "reasoning": "The problem describes a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system where a mass is attached to a spring, which in turn is attached to the free end of a cantilever beam. This configuration implies that the cantilever beam and the spring are acting in series. Therefore, their stiffnesses must be combined using the series spring formula to find the equivalent stiffness of the system. Once the equivalent stiffness is found, the natural angular frequency can be calculated using the standard SDOF formula.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the stiffness of the cantilever beam ($k_{beam}$). The formula for the stiffness of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at its free end is $k_{beam} = \\frac{3EI}{L^3}$.\nGiven: $E = 210 \\text{ GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $I = 8.33 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^4$, $L = 0.6 \\text{ m}$.\n$k_{beam} = \\frac{3 \\times (210 \\times 10^9) \\times (8.33 \\times 10^{-10})}{(0.6)^3} = \\frac{3 \\times 210 \\times 8.33 \\times 10^{-1}}{0.216} = \\frac{524.79}{0.216} \\approx 2430.509 \\text{ N/m}$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the equivalent stiffness ($k_{eq}$) of the beam and the attached spring. Since the beam and the spring are in series, their equivalent stiffness is given by:\n$\\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{k_{beam}} + \\frac{1}{k_{spring}}$\nGiven: $k_{spring} = 500 \\text{ N/m}$.\n$\\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{2430.509} + \\frac{1}{500} \\approx 0.00041143 + 0.002 = 0.00241143 \\text{ m/N}$.\n$k_{eq} = \\frac{1}{0.00241143} \\approx 414.69 \\text{ N/m}$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the fundamental natural frequency (angular frequency, $\\omega_n$). The formula for the natural angular frequency of an SDOF system is $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eq}}{m}}$.\nGiven: $m = 1 \\text{ kg}$.\n$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{414.69}{1}} = \\sqrt{414.69} \\approx 20.3639 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n\nComparing this value with the given options, option B (20.36) is the closest match."

If formulas are known, it's a straightforward and high-scoring problem.",

Therefore, choose an option with a frequency slightly lower than 22.36 rad/s (e.g., 20.36 rad/s).",

Avoid over-deriving; use known deflection formulas. If stuck, a quick check can be to compare k_beam and k_spring; if k_beam is larger, the equivalent stiffness will be less than k_spring, implying a natural frequency less than sqrt(500/1) = 22.36 rad/s."
