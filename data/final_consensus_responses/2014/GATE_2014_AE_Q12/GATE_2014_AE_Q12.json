This is based on the principle of mass conservation in classical mechanics, assuming no material is added or removed, and non-relativistic conditions. While external loads can cause deformation, changing the solid's shape and volume, the total amount of matter (mass) within the solid does not change.\n\n*   **Option A (Volume does not vary with loading):** This is generally false. Solids are deformable. Under tensile loads, volume typically increases, and under compressive loads, volume decreases.\n*   **Option C (Density does not vary with loading):** This is also false. Density ($\\rho$) is defined as mass ($m$) per unit volume ($V$), i.e., $\\rho = m/V$. Since mass ($m$) remains constant and volume ($V$) generally changes with loading, density ($\\rho$) must also change. For example, if volume decreases under compression, density increases.\n*   **Option D (Volume, mass and density vary with loading):** This statement is partially true (volume and density vary) but incorrect because mass does not vary with loading."

        "Analyze the concept of volume: Solids are deformable bodies. When subjected to external loads, they undergo deformation, which typically involves a change in overall dimensions and thus the volume. For example, tension can increase volume, compression can decrease it. Hence, volume does vary with loading.",
