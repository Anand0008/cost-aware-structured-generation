Given ideal expansion, exit pressure P_e equals ambient pressure P_a = 0.9 bar. Using isentropic expansion from turbine exit stagnation conditions (P_{04}=1.6 bar, T_{04}=774 K) with \\gamma=1.33, the exit static temperature T_e is calculated. Then V_e is found using the energy equation across the nozzle with C_p=1147 J/kgK. Finally, the specific thrust is obtained by subtracting the flight speed V_a=270 m/s from V_e. The calculated value falls within the official answer range of 215.0 to 217.0 Ns/kg."
