      "reasoning": "Statement P: \"Strain compatibility equations must be satisfied in the solution of three-dimensional problems in elasticity.\"\nCompatibility equations are fundamental requirements in elasticity. They ensure that a deformed body remains continuous, without gaps, voids, or overlaps. For a 3D elasticity solution to be physically meaningful, the strain field must correspond to a continuous displacement field, which necessitates satisfying compatibility equations. Therefore, statement P is TRUE.\n\nStatement Q: \"Six strains are defined in terms of three displacement functions and can have arbitrary values.\"\nWhile six strain components (three normal and three shear) are indeed derived from three displacement functions (u, v, w), they are not independent. Because there are more strain components than displacement functions, the strains are mathematically linked and constrained by the compatibility relations. They cannot have arbitrary values. Therefore, statement Q is FALSE.\n\nStatement R: \"Compatibility equations are an expression of the continuity of displacements.\"\nCompatibility equations ensure that the displacement field is single-valued and continuous throughout the body. They guarantee that the deformed body remains a coherent, continuous whole, meaning no voids or overlaps occur. This directly relates to the continuity of displacements. Therefore, statement R is TRUE.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements P and R are true, while statement Q is false. Hence, option C is the correct answer."

      "Differential Geometry": "Compatibility conditions are related to the concept of integrability of a tensor field (strain as a derivative of displacement).",
      "Finite Element Analysis (FEA)": "In displacement-based FEA, compatibility is often implicitly satisfied within elements and enforced at element boundaries (C0 continuity). In stress-based FEA, compatibility is explicitly considered.",
      "Finite Element Method (FEM)": "The choice of shape functions in FEM is governed by compatibility requirements (C0, C1 continuity) to ensure convergence.",
      "Finite Element Methods": "Displacement-based FEM enforces compatibility by using shape functions that ensure continuity of displacements across element boundaries.",
      "Mathematics (Partial Differential Equations)": "The compatibility equations are a set of partial differential equations that relate the derivatives of strain components.",
      "Solid Mechanics": "Compatibility equations are a cornerstone of solid mechanics, ensuring physically realistic deformations and appearing in statically indeterminate problems.",
      "Structural Analysis": "In indeterminate structures, compatibility of displacements/rotations at joints is essential to determine internal forces."
