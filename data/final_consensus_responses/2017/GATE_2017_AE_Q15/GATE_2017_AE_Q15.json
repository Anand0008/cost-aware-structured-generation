      "reasoning": "A process is considered reversible if, after it has occurred, both the system and its surroundings can be restored to their initial states without leaving any net change in the universe. This ideal condition requires the absence of all irreversibilities. Irreversibilities arise from finite gradients (pressure, temperature) or dissipative effects (like friction). The problem statement specifies a 'frictionless piston', eliminating friction as a source of irreversibility within the system for mechanical processes.\n\nLet's analyze each process:\n*   **(i) Expansion with finite pressure difference with the surrounding:** A finite pressure difference implies that the expansion is not quasi-static (infinitesimally slow). This leads to unrestrained expansion, which is a highly irreversible process because the system is not in equilibrium with its surroundings at all times. Therefore, this process is irreversible.\n*   **(ii) Compression with infinitesimal pressure difference with the surrounding:** An infinitesimal pressure difference means the compression occurs quasi-statically. The system is always infinitesimally close to equilibrium with its surroundings. Given the frictionless piston, this process avoids mechanical irreversibilities and is considered internally reversible.\n*   **(iii) Heat transfer with finite temperature difference with the reservoir:** Heat transfer across a finite temperature difference is a classic example of an external irreversibility. For heat transfer to be reversible, the temperature difference between the system and the reservoir must be infinitesimally small. Therefore, this process is irreversible.\n*   **(iv) Heat transfer with infinitesimal temperature difference with the reservoir:** An infinitesimal temperature difference ensures that the heat transfer process is externally reversible. The system and the reservoir are always infinitesimally close to thermal equilibrium, preventing entropy generation due to thermal gradients.\n\nBased on this analysis, only processes (ii) and (iv) are reversible. Thus, option D is the correct answer."

        "description": "A process is reversible if it generates no entropy ($\\Delta S_{gen} = 0$). Instead of relying only on verbal definitions, one can imagine each process and qualitatively assess entropy generation: finite \\Delta T in heat transfer or finite \\Delta P in expansion/compression implies positive entropy generation, hence irreversibility. Infinitesimal differences imply zero entropy generation in the ideal limit.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More fundamental and general, deepens understanding by linking reversibility directly to entropy. Cons: More abstract for beginners, may be slower in an exam setting, and requires understanding of entropy generation, which is a more advanced concept.",
        "when_to_use": "For a deeper theoretical analysis, when revising theory, or when connecting conceptual questions to the second law and entropy, especially for complex systems."
