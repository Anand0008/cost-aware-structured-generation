      "reasoning": "The steepest path on a contour map is always perpendicular to the contour lines and occurs where the contour lines are most densely packed (closest together). This is a fundamental principle derived from the concept of the gradient of a scalar field. The gradient vector points in the direction of the maximum rate of change and is perpendicular to the level surfaces (contour lines). Visually inspecting the provided contour plot, the contour lines around point P are most tightly packed along the vertical direction, specifically towards point R. This indicates the largest change in altitude over the shortest horizontal distance, hence the steepest slope. The path P to R descends from an approximate elevation of 560m (between 550m and 575m) to 425m, crossing numerous contour lines in a relatively short horizontal distance, making it the steepest option among the choices."

        "Understand that contour lines on a map connect points of equal elevation (height above mean sea level). The question states the contour interval is 25 m, meaning each adjacent contour line represents a 25 m change in elevation.",
        "Recall the concept of the 'steepest path'. The steepest path from any point corresponds to the direction of the maximum rate of change of elevation, which is given by the gradient of the scalar function (altitude).",
        "Relate the gradient to contour lines. The gradient vector is always perpendicular to the contour lines at any point. Its magnitude (the steepness of the slope) is inversely proportional to the spacing between contour lines. Therefore, the steepest path is perpendicular to the contour lines and occurs where the contour lines are closest together.",
        "Analyze the contour plot around point P. Locate point P on the map. Point P is situated between the 550 m and 575 m contour lines, indicating an approximate elevation of 560-565 m.",
        "Identify the region of densest contour lines. Visually examine the spacing of the contour lines around P in the directions of Q, R, S, and T. The contour lines are most closely spaced along the path from P towards R.",
        "Determine the steepest path. Comparing the density of contour lines, the path from P towards R exhibits the tightest packing of contour lines. This indicates the largest change in elevation over the shortest horizontal distance, making P to R the steepest path. The path goes from P (approx. 560m) to R (425m), indicating a significant drop in elevation."
