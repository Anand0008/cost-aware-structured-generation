'No losses in the impeller' implies ideal work input and typically an axial inlet, so inlet whirl velocity C_w1 = 0.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the specific work input (w_c) to the compressor.\nThe total shaft power is the product of mass flow rate and specific work: P = ṁ × w_c.\nTherefore, w_c = P / ṁ = 1,800,000 W / 10 kg/s = 180,000 J/kg.",
        "Step 3: Apply the Euler Turbomachinery Equation and simplify.\nThe Euler work equation for a turbomachine is w_c = U_2 C_w2 - U_1 C_w1.\nGiven the assumptions:\n*   Axial inlet (no prewhirl): C_w1 = 0.\n*   No slip: C_w2 = U_2.\nSubstituting these into the Euler equation:\nw_c = U_2 × U_2 - U_1 × 0 = U_2^2.",
        "Step 4: Using the simplified Euler equation ($w_c = U_2^2$) for an ideal compressor with axial inlet and no slip, solve for the impeller tip speed ($U_2$). $U_2 = \\sqrt{w_c} = \\sqrt{180,000} \\approx 424.264 \\ \\text{m/s}$.",
        "Step 5: Relate the impeller tip speed ($U_2$) to the impeller diameter ($D_2$) and angular velocity ($\\omega$). The tip speed is given by $U_2 = \\omega r_2 = \\omega (D_2/2)$. Rearrange this equation to solve for the impeller diameter: $D_2 = \\frac{2 U_2}{\\omega}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the calculated tip speed ($U_2 \\approx 424.264 \\ \\text{m/s}$) and the given angular velocity ($\\omega = 1900 \\ \\text{rad/s}$) into the rearranged equation for $D_2$: $D_2 = \\frac{2 \\times 424.264}{1900} \\approx 0.4466 \\ \\text{m}$.
