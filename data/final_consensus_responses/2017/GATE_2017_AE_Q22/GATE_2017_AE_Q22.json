Given the first mass displacement is 1 cm, the second mass displacement is found using the ratio defined by the mode shape components. For phi1 = [0.732, 1]^T, the ratio is d2/d1 = 1/0.732. With d1 = 1 cm, d2 = 1/0.732 ≈ 1.366120 cm. Rounding to three decimal places gives 1.366 cm, which lies within the answer key range of 1.360 to 1.370."

        "Step 1: Understand the principle of pure mode excitation. For an undamped linear multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, if the initial displacement vector is exactly proportional to a particular mode shape, then the resulting free vibration will occur only in that mode.",
        "Step 1: Identify the given data. The first mode shape is `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 = [0.732 \\ 1]^T$`. Let the initial displacement vector be `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = [u_1(0) \\ u_2(0)]^T$`.",
        "Step 2: Formulate the condition for pure first-mode vibration. For the system to vibrate in the first mode alone, the initial displacement vector `$\\mathbf{u}(0)$` must be proportional to the first mode shape `$\\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`. Thus, `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = C \\mathbf{\\phi}_1$`, where `C` is a scalar constant. Given `$\\ u_1(0) = 1 \\text{ cm}$`, the initial displacement vector is `$\\mathbf{u}(0) = [1 \\ u_2(0)]^T$`.",
        "Step 3: Set up the equations based on the proportionality. Substitute the initial displacement vector and mode shape into the proportionality equation: `$[1 \\ u_2(0)]^T = C [0.732 \\ 1]^T$`. This gives two scalar equations: `$\\ 1 = C \\times 0.732$` (from the first component) and `$\\ u_2(0) = C \\times 1$` (from the second component).",
        "Step 4: Solve for the constant `C`. From the first scalar equation, `$\\ 1 = C \\times 0.732$`, we find `$\\ C = 1 / 0.732$`. Calculate this value: `$\\ C \\approx 1.3661202$`.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the required displacement of the second mass. Substitute the value of `C` into the second scalar equation: `$\\ u_2(0) = C \\times 1 = 1.3661202 \\times 1 \\approx 1.3661202 \\text{ cm}$`.",
        "Step 6: Round the result to three decimal places as required. `$\\ u_2(0) \\approx 1.366 \\text{ cm}$`.",
