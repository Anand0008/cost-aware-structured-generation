      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements about the shear center of a cross-section.\n\n**Statement P: It is that point in the cross-section through which shear loads produce no twisting.** This is the fundamental definition of the shear center. When a transverse shear force is applied through this point, it causes bending without inducing any torsion. Therefore, statement P is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement Q: This point is also the centre of twist of sections subjected to pure torsion.** For thin-walled open sections, the shear center indeed coincides with the center of twist. This means that if a torsional moment is applied such that its axis passes through the shear center, the section will undergo pure torsion without any bending. Therefore, statement Q is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement R: The normal stress at this point is always zero.** This statement is **FALSE**. The shear center is generally distinct from the neutral axis (where normal stress due to bending is zero) and the centroid. Normal stress at any point, including the shear center, can be non-zero due to bending moments or axial forces. The statement 'always zero' makes it definitively incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements P and Q are true, while statement R is false. Thus, the correct answer involves P and Q only."

The shear center is not necessarily the same as the centroid or the neutral axis (where normal stress due to bending is zero). They only coincide for sections with at least one axis of symmetry. Additionally, normal stress can arise from axial forces. Therefore, the normal stress at the shear center is not 'always' zero, making R false.",
