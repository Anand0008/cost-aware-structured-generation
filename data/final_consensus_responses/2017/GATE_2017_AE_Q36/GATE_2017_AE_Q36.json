      "reasoning": "The problem is solved using the control volume approach for linear momentum. First, the inlet velocity ($V_1$) is determined using the continuity equation, requiring accurate interpretation of diameters from the image (e.g., D1=8 cm, D2=4 cm). Then, the inlet pressure ($P_1$) is found using Bernoulli's equation, assuming incompressible, inviscid flow and negligible elevation changes. Finally, the linear momentum equation is applied to a control volume encompassing the nozzle. It's crucial to use gauge pressures for the pressure forces when the exit is open to the atmosphere. The calculated axial force on the flange is approximately 90.5 N, which rounds to 91 N and falls within the specified correct answer range of 90-92 N."

Assume frictionless, steady, incompressible, and horizontal flow, so elevation changes are negligible.",
        "Calculate the cross-sectional areas at the inlet (Section 1) and exit (Section 2). $A_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D_1^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (0.08)^2 = 0.0016\\pi \\text{ m}^2$. $A_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D_2^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (0.04)^2 = 0.0004\\pi \\text{ m}^2$.",
        "Apply the Continuity Equation for steady, incompressible flow ($A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$) to find the inlet velocity $V_1$. $V_1 = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} V_2 = \\frac{0.0004\\pi}{0.0016\\pi} (8 \\text{ m/s}) = \\frac{1}{4} (8 \\text{ m/s}) = 2 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Apply Bernoulli's Equation between Section 1 and Section 2 ($P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2$).
