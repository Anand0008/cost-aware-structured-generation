The induced drag coefficient is given by $C_{Di} = K \\cdot C_L^2$, where $K = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\cdot AR \\cdot e}$. Therefore, we set $C_{D0} = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\cdot AR \\cdot e} \\cdot C_L^2$. Rearranging to solve for the aspect ratio (AR): $AR = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi \\cdot e \\cdot C_{D0}}$. Plugging in the given values: $C_L = 0.8$, $C_{D0} = 0.020$, and $e = 1.0$. $AR = \\frac{(0.8)^2}{\\pi \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot 0.020} = \\frac{0.64}{0.06283185} \\approx 10.1859$.

        "Step 1: Recognize that for minimum thrust required in steady level flight, the aircraft must fly at maximum lift-to-drag ratio (L/D_max). Identify the given aerodynamic characteristics: CD0 = 0.020, Oswald efficiency e = 1.0, and the lift coefficient for minimum thrust required CL = 0.8. The goal is to find the Aspect Ratio (AR).",
        "Step 2: Recall the condition for minimum thrust required in steady, level flight, which occurs when the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is maximized. This condition is met when the zero-lift drag coefficient (CD0) equals the induced drag coefficient (CD_i), i.e., CD0 = CD_i.",
        "Step 3: Express the induced drag coefficient (CD_i) and the induced drag factor (K). The induced drag coefficient is given by CD_i = K \\cdot CL^2, where K is related to the aspect ratio (AR) and Oswald efficiency factor (e) by the formula K = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\cdot AR \\cdot e}.",
        "Step 4: Set up the equation based on the condition for minimum thrust required (CD0 = CD_i). Equating CD0 and K \\cdot CL^2: CD0 = K \\cdot CL^2. Substitute the expression for K: CD0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\cdot AR \\cdot e} \\cdot CL^2.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the equation from Step 4 to solve for the Aspect Ratio (AR): AR = \\frac{CL^2}{\\pi \\cdot e \\cdot CD0}.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given numerical values (CD0 = 0.020, e = 1.0, CL = 0.8) into the rearranged formula: AR = \\frac{(0.8)^2}{\\pi \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot 0.020}.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of AR: AR = \\frac{0.64}{\\pi \\cdot 0.020} = \\frac{0.64}{0.06283185} \\approx 10.1859.",
        "Step 8: Round the result to three decimal places: AR = 10.186."
