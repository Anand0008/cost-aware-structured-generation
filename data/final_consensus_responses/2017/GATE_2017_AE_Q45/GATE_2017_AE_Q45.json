        "application": "Gas turbine engine fuel control and combustor design",
        "industry_example": "In a turbofan engine like the CFM56, the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) schedules fuel flow based on air flow to maintain a desired equivalence ratio. While the overall combustor might be lean, the primary combustion zone often operates near stoichiometric (around 15:1 for jet fuel) for stable and efficient flame propagation. This is crucial for engine performance and emissions control.",
        "why_it_matters": "Precise control of the A/F ratio is critical because incorrect fuel flow can lead to engine flameout (too lean), overheating (too rich), incomplete combustion, and excessive harmful emissions (CO, NOx, unburnt hydrocarbons). This impacts engine performance, efficiency, and environmental compliance."

      "guessing_heuristic": "If you remember that the stoichiometric A/F ratio for most hydrocarbon fuels is around 15:1, then for an air flow of 1 kg/s, the fuel flow should be approximately 1/15 kg/s (around 0.066-0.067 kg/s). Use this to eliminate options that are wildly different or involve an inverted ratio (e.g., 15 kg/s).",
