      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the stage pressure ratio of an axial compressor using velocity triangle data and thermodynamic properties. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine tangential components of absolute velocity ($V_{w1}$, $V_{w2}$):** From the given velocity triangles, the relative flow angles $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are provided. The axial velocity ($V_z$) and peripheral blade speed ($U$) are also given. For an axial compressor rotor, the tangential components of absolute velocity are related to the relative flow angles by:\n    *   At inlet (1): $V_{w1} = U - V_z \\tan(\\beta_1)$\n    *   At outlet (2): $V_{w2} = U - V_z \\tan(\\beta_2)$\n\n    Given: $U = 200 \\text{ m/s}$, $V_z = 165 \\text{ m/s}$, $\\beta_1 = 45^\\circ$, $\\beta_2 = 11^\\circ$.\n    *   $V_{w1} = 200 - 165 \\tan(45^\\circ) = 200 - 165 \\times 1 = 35 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $V_{w2} = 200 - 165 \\tan(11^\\circ) = 200 - 165 \\times 0.19438 = 200 - 32.0727 = 167.9273 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the actual stagnation temperature rise ($\\Delta T_{0}$):** The actual work done on the fluid by the rotor per unit mass ($W_{actual}$) is given by the Euler turbomachinery equation. This work translates directly into a stagnation temperature rise.\n    *   $W_{actual} = U(V_{w2} - V_{w1})$\n    *   $\\Delta T_{0} = \\frac{W_{actual}}{C_p} = \\frac{U(V_{w2} - V_{w1})}{C_p}$\n\n    Given: $C_p = 1.005 \\text{ kJ/kgK} = 1005 \\text{ J/kgK}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_{0} = \\frac{200 \\times (167.9273 - 35)}{1005} = \\frac{200 \\times 132.9273}{1005} = \\frac{26585.46}{1005} = 26.45319 \\text{ K}$\n\n    *Note: The phrase 'Considering actual work in the rotor is equal to the ideal work' implies that the work calculated by the Euler equation is the actual work input to the rotor. The stage efficiency then relates this actual work to the isentropic temperature rise required for the pressure ratio.*\n\n3.  **Calculate the stage pressure ratio ($\\pi_{st}$):** The stage pressure ratio is related to the actual stagnation temperature rise, inlet stagnation temperature, and stage isentropic efficiency by the following relation:\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\eta_{stg} \\Delta T_{0}}{T_{01}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n\n    Given: $\\eta_{stg} = 0.8$, $T_{01} = 298 \\text{ K}$, $\\gamma = 1.4$.\n    *   Exponent: $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{1.4}{1.4-1} = \\frac{1.4}{0.4} = 3.5$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.8 \\times 26.45319}{298}\\right)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = \\left(1 + \\frac{21.162552}{298}\\right)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = (1 + 0.071015275)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} = (1.071015275)^{3.5}$\n    *   $\\pi_{st} \\approx 1.2725$\n\nRounding to two decimal points, the pressure ratio for the stage is $\\mathbf{1.27}$."
