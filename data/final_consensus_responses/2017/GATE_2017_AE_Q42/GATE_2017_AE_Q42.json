The computed \\zeta=0.63 falls in this range. During flight testing, engineers measure the actual dynamic response to control inputs and compare observed natural frequencies and damping ratios against these design specifications.",
        "why_it_matters": "If \\zeta is too low (<0.35), the aircraft will oscillate excessively after a disturbance, feeling 'sloppy' or prone to pilot-induced oscillations. If too high (>1.3), it may feel sluggish or 'stiff' and unresponsive, making it difficult to fly precisely, especially in turbulence or during landing approaches."

      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure about the calculation, eliminate options that have values outside the typical range for the short period mode (e.g., \\omega_n is typically >2 rad/s and \\zeta around 0.3-0.8 for conventional aircraft). Specifically, eliminate options with a very low frequency or very high damping ratio. Also, if you calculate a negative damping ratio, you've made a sign error and should recheck your work.",
      "time_management": "Spend no more than 3 minutes. The calculation is straightforward once the mode is identified and formulas are recalled. If stuck, compute both pairs of roots and see which gives a match."
