      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio $\\omega_{d1} / \\omega_{d2}$ of damped natural frequencies. Case 1 (viscous damping): $\\omega_{d1} = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi f_n = 10\\pi$ rad/s and $\\zeta = 0.2$. Thus, $\\omega_{d1} = 10\\pi \\sqrt{1-0.04} = 10\\pi \\sqrt{0.96}$. Case 2 (Coulomb/frictional damping): For a spring-mass system with dry friction on a surface, the frequency of oscillation during free vibration remains the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n$, provided the restoring force (spring) is linear and friction only causes constant amplitude decay per cycle. The 'damped natural frequency' in this context is simply $\\omega_{d2} = \\omega_n = 10\\pi$ rad/s. The ratio is therefore $\\omega_{d1} / \\omega_{d2} = \\sqrt{0.96} \\approx 0.979795...$, which rounds to 0.980 (three decimal places). This matches the provided answer key range of 0.970 to 0.990."

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. Undamped natural frequency $f_n = 5$ Hz. Therefore, angular natural frequency $\\omega_n = 2\\pi f_n = 10\\pi$ rad/s. Case 1: Viscous damping ratio $\\zeta = 0.2$. Case 2: Coefficient of friction $\\mu = 0.01$ (Coulomb damping).",
        "Step 2: For Case 1 (viscous damping), recall the formula for damped natural frequency in a Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) system. For an underdamped system ($\\zeta < 1$), $\\omega_{d1} = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$. Substitute $\\zeta = 0.2$: $\\omega_{d1} = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2} = \\omega_n \\sqrt{0.96}$.",
        "Step 3: For Case 2 (Coulomb/frictional damping), understand its behavior. In free vibration with constant dry friction, the period (and hence frequency) of oscillation is not significantly affected by the magnitude of the constant friction force for a linear spring; it remains approximately equal to the undamped natural period. Therefore, $\\omega_{d2} = \\omega_n$.",
        "Step 4: Form the required ratio of damped natural frequencies (Case 1 to Case 2): $\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\omega_{d1}}{\\omega_{d2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n \\sqrt{0.96}}{\\omega_n} = \\sqrt{0.96}$.",

        "description": "Consider the work done by friction force over one cycle. For Coulomb damping, the energy loss per cycle is $\\Delta E = 4 \\mu mg X$ (where X is amplitude), independent of frequency. This constant energy loss per cycle leads to linear amplitude decay but does not affect the system's stiffness or inertia, hence frequency remains $\\omega_n$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides physical intuition. Cons: More involved than the direct fact that frequency is unchanged.",
        "when_to_use": "To deeply understand why frequency is constant in Coulomb damping."
