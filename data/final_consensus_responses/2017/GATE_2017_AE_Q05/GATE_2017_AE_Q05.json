      "reasoning": "The N-point Gauss Quadrature formula exactly integrates polynomials of degree up to $2N-1$. For a 3-point formula ($N=3$), it exactly integrates polynomials up to degree $2(3)-1 = 5$. Additionally, due to the symmetry of the integration interval $[-1, 1]$ and the symmetric nodes and weights of Gauss-Legendre quadrature, it also exactly integrates any odd function (including odd polynomials of any degree) because the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero, and the symmetric sum $A_j f(x_j)$ will also evaluate to zero for an odd function.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Option A: $f(x) = 5 - x^7$**\n    This function can be split into an even part ($5$) and an odd part ($-x^7$).\n    *   The constant $5$ is a polynomial of degree 0. Since $0 \\le 5$, it is exactly integrated by the 3-point formula.\n    *   The term $-x^7$ is an odd polynomial of degree 7. For an odd function $g(x)$ over a symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$, $\\int_{-1}^1 g(x) dx = 0$. The 3-point Gauss formula has symmetric nodes ($x_1=0, x_2=-x_3$) and symmetric weights ($A_2=A_3$). For an odd function $g(x)$, $g(0)=0$ and $g(-x_3) = -g(x_3)$. Thus, the approximation is $A_1 g(x_1) + A_2 g(x_2) + A_3 g(x_3) = A_1 g(0) + A_2 g(-x_3) + A_3 g(x_3) = A_1(0) + A_2(-g(x_3)) + A_3(g(x_3)) = (-A_2+A_3)g(x_3)$. Since $A_2=A_3$, this sum is $0$. Therefore, the odd part $-x^7$ is also exactly integrated to $0$. \n    *   Since both parts are exactly integrated, $f(x) = 5 - x^7$ is exactly integrated.\n\n2.  **Option B: $f(x) = 2 + 3x + 6x^4$**\n    This is a polynomial of degree 4. Since $4 \\le 5$, it is exactly integrated by the 3-point formula.\n\n3.  **Option C: $f(x) = 13 + 6x^3 + x^6$**\n    This function contains the term $x^6$, which is an even polynomial of degree 6. Since $6 > 5$, this term is not guaranteed to be exactly integrated. Let's verify:\n    *   True integral of $x^6$ over $[-1, 1]$: $\\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx = [\\frac{x^7}{7}]_{-1}^1 = \\frac{1}{7} - (-\\frac{1}{7}) = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n    *   Gauss approximation for $x^6$: $A_1(0)^6 + A_2(- \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}})^6 + A_3(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}})^6 = 0 + \\frac{5}{9}(\\frac{3}{5})^3 + \\frac{5}{9}(\\frac{3}{5})^3 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{125} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{25} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{25} = \\frac{6}{25}$.\n    *   Since $\\frac{2}{7} \\ne \\frac{6}{25}$, $x^6$ is not exactly integrated. Therefore, $f(x) = 13 + 6x^3 + x^6$ is not exactly integrated.\n\n4.  **Option D: $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$**\n    This is not a polynomial. Gauss Quadrature is designed to exactly integrate polynomials up to a certain degree, and approximates other functions. Thus, it is not exactly integrated.\n\nBoth options A and B are exactly integrated by the given 3-point Gaussian formula."

        "Step 3: Note the symmetry of the 3-point Gauss-Legendre nodes ($x_1=0, x_2=-\\sqrt{3/5}, x_3=\\sqrt{3/5}$) and weights ($A_1=8/9, A_2=A_3=5/9$). This symmetry implies that the formula will exactly integrate any odd function over $[-1, 1]$ to zero, as the sum $A_j f(x_j)$ will also be zero for an odd function.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option A: $f(x) = 5 - x^7$. The constant term $5$ (degree 0) is exactly integrated. The term $-x^7$ (degree 7) is an odd function. Due to the symmetry of the quadrature rule and the interval, the integral of an odd function over $[-1,1]$ is zero, and the quadrature sum for an odd function is also zero. Therefore, $f(x)$ is exactly integrated.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option B: $f(x) = 2 + 3x + 6x^4$. This is a polynomial of degree 4. Since $4 \\le 5$, it is guaranteed to be exactly integrated by the $2N-1$ rule.",

        "Step 7: Evaluate Option D: $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$. This is not a polynomial. Gauss-Legendre quadrature is designed for exact integration of polynomials up to a certain degree, not general non-polynomial functions. Therefore, it is not exactly integrated.",

FEA relies heavily on numerical integration (often Gaussian quadrature) to compute stiffness matrices and force vectors for complex geometries. Similarly, in CFD simulations, 3-point Gaussian quadrature is commonly used to numerically integrate the Navier-Stokes equations over computational grids, allowing for better prediction of aerodynamic forces on aircraft.",

Errors in integration can lead to inaccurate predictions and potentially catastrophic design flaws, while correct Gauss order ensures accurate and efficient structural analysis."
