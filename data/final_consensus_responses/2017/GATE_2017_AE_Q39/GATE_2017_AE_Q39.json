      "reasoning": "The question asks for control actions to maintain steady level flight at the same lift coefficient (CL=0.5) and same altitude after deploying the landing gear.\n\n1.  **Effect of Landing Gear Deployment:** Deploying the landing gear significantly increases the aircraft's form drag and interference drag, thus increasing the overall drag coefficient (CD) of the aircraft. It also typically creates a nose-down pitching moment due to the added drag acting below the center of gravity.\n\n2.  **Maintaining Steady Level Flight (Vertical Balance):** For steady level flight, Lift (L) must equal Weight (W). The problem states the aircraft maintains the same altitude (meaning constant air density $\\rho$), same weight (W), same wing area (S), and crucially, the same lift coefficient (CL=0.5). From the lift equation, $L = 0.5 \\times \\rho \\times V^2 \\times S \\times CL$. Since L, $\\rho$, S, and CL are all constant, the airspeed (V) must also remain constant.\n\n3.  **Maintaining Steady Level Flight (Horizontal Balance):** For steady level flight, Thrust (T) must equal Drag (D). Since the landing gear deployment increases the drag coefficient (CD) and the airspeed (V) remains constant, the total drag $D = 0.5 \\times \\rho \\times V^2 \\times S \\times CD$ will increase. To maintain $T=D$, the pilot must **increase the throttle** to generate more thrust.\n\n4.  **Elevator Action for Pitch Trim:** To counteract the nose-down pitching moment caused by the deployed landing gear and maintain the desired angle of attack (which corresponds to the constant CL=0.5), the pilot needs to generate a nose-up pitching moment. A nose-up pitching moment is achieved by moving the elevator trailing edge **up** (pulling the control stick back).\n\nTherefore, to maintain steady level flight at the same CL and altitude, the pilot must move the elevator up and increase the throttle. This corresponds to option B."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the initial flight condition. The aircraft is in steady level flight, meaning lift equals weight ($L=W$) and thrust equals drag ($T=D$). The pilot maintains a constant lift coefficient ($C_L=0.5$) and altitude (500m, implying constant air density $\\rho$). The goal is to maintain these conditions after an emergency.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the effect of deploying the landing gear. Deploying the landing gear significantly increases the aircraft's overall drag coefficient ($C_D$) due to increased form and interference drag. This leads to a substantial increase in total drag ($D$). Additionally, the deployed gear typically creates a nose-down pitching moment because the added drag acts below the aircraft's center of gravity.",
        "Step 3: Determine the required change in thrust. To maintain steady level flight at the *same lift coefficient ($C_L$)* and *same altitude*, and assuming constant weight, the lift equation ($L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$) dictates that the airspeed ($V$) must remain constant. Since total drag ($D$) has increased due to landing gear deployment, and $V$ must remain constant, the pilot must **increase the throttle** to generate more thrust ($T$) to match the increased drag ($T=D$).",
        "Analyze the pitching moment effect. The landing gear deployment typically creates an additional nose-down pitching moment because the increased drag acts below the aircraft's center of gravity. This moment tends to decrease the angle of attack, which would reduce lift.",
        "Determine the required elevator action. To counteract the nose-down pitching moment and maintain the constant angle of attack (and thus $C_L$) required for steady level flight, the pilot must generate a nose-up pitching moment. This is achieved by deflecting the elevator trailing edge up (pulling the control stick back).",
        "Combine control actions. In summary, the pilot must increase throttle to compensate for the increased drag and move the elevator up to counteract the nose-down pitching moment and maintain the desired angle of attack and trim condition."

They must then increase power (throttle) to maintain airspeed and pull back on the control column (elevator up) to maintain the desired pitch attitude and descent rate, ensuring a stable, controlled descent.",
