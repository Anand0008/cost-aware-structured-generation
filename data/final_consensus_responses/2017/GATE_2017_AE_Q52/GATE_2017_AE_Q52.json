The unknown is `$\\sigma_x$`.",
        "Recall the formula for principal stresses in a 2D plane stress state: `$$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$$`.",
        "Since the minimum principal stress `$\\sigma_{II}$` is given, use the negative sign in the principal stress formula: `$$\\sigma_{II} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$$`.",

Underestimating maximum stress can lead to crack initiation or buckling, risking structural failure and compromising safety."

The center of the circle is at `$(\\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2}, 0)$` and the radius is `$\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$`. Principal stresses are found at the intersections of the circle with the normal stress axis (σ-axis), where `$\\sigma_I = C+R$` and `$\\sigma_{II} = C-R$`. This method allows for direct reading of principal stresses and can be used to geometrically solve for unknown stress components.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides a visual representation of the stress state, offers strong geometric intuition, helps understand stress transformation, and can be used for verification. Cons: Requires careful plotting and drawing to scale, can be time-consuming in an exam setting, and is generally less precise than analytical methods.",
