      "reasoning": "The answer is computed using thin airfoil theory. For an infinite wing (2D airfoil) under thin airfoil theory, the lift slope (a0) is 2π per radian. This must be corrected for a finite wing using the given span effectiveness factor (e) and aspect ratio (AR). The formula from finite wing theory gives the finite wing lift slope (a). Using this slope and the angle of attack (with zero-lift angle = 0° for symmetric NACA 0012), the lift coefficient CL is calculated. The computed value of ~0.544 falls within the official answer key range of 0.540 to 0.550."

        "Step 4: Convert the given angle of attack ($\\alpha$) from degrees to radians for consistency with the lift slope $a$ (if $a$ is in per radian): $\\alpha_{\\text{rad}} = \\alpha_{\\text{deg}} \\times (\\pi / 180^{\\circ})$.",
        "Step 5: Compute the lift coefficient ($C_L$) using the finite wing lift slope ($a$) and the effective angle of attack: $C_L = a \\cdot (\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0})$. Since $\\alpha_{L=0} = 0^{\\circ}$, this simplifies to $C_L = a \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{rad}}$.",
