      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the statement that is NOT true. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A. The pitching moment of any airfoil at any angle of attack is always zero at the center of pressure.**\n    *   This statement is **TRUE**. By definition, the Center of Pressure (CP) is the point where the resultant aerodynamic force acts, and thus, the pitching moment about the CP is zero.\n\n*   **B. The pitching moment of any airfoil at any angle of attack is always zero at the aerodynamic center.**\n    *   This statement is **NOT TRUE**. While the pitching moment coefficient about the Aerodynamic Center (AC) is *constant* (independent of angle of attack), it is not always zero. For a symmetric airfoil, the pitching moment about the AC (`C_{m,ac}`) is indeed zero. However, for a *cambered* airfoil, the pitching moment about the AC (`C_{m,ac}`) is constant but typically *non-zero* (usually negative). Therefore, stating it's *always* zero for *any* airfoil is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. The center of pressure and aerodynamic center coincide for a symmetric airfoil.**\n    *   This statement is **TRUE**. For a symmetric airfoil, both the Center of Pressure (CP) and the Aerodynamic Center (AC) are located at the quarter-chord point (`c/4`). Thus, they coincide.\n\n*   **D. The pitching moment about the aerodynamic center, for any airfoil, does not vary with angle of attack.**\n    *   This statement is **TRUE**. This is the fundamental defining characteristic of the Aerodynamic Center (AC). The pitching moment coefficient about the AC (`C_{m,ac}`) is constant and independent of the angle of attack (`\\alpha`), meaning `dC_{m,ac}/d\\alpha = 0`.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement B is the only one that is NOT true."

        "description": "Plot pitching moment coefficient ($C_m$) vs lift coefficient ($C_l$). The slope of this line is related to the position of the point about which the moment is taken relative to the AC. The AC is the point where the slope is zero, meaning $C_m$ is constant as $C_l$ (and hence $\\alpha$) changes.",

      "Aircraft Stability and Control": "The constant $C_{m,ac}$ of the wing and tail surfaces are used in the total pitching moment equation to size the horizontal stabilizer for trim.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "The concepts of aerodynamic center and pitching moment are fundamental to understanding and analyzing aircraft longitudinal static stability. The relative position of the AC and the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) directly determines the aircraft's longitudinal static margin and overall stability."
