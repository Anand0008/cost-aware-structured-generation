The key is to use the isentropic pressure ratio relation.\n\nFirst, the reservoir pressure `P_o` is given as 1 atm (gage). Assuming standard atmospheric pressure is 1 atm (absolute), the absolute reservoir pressure `P_0` is:\n`P_0 = P_o (gage) + P_ambient (absolute) = 1 atm + 1 atm = 2 atm (absolute)`\n\nThe isentropic pressure ratio formula is:\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_e^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$$`\n\nGiven `M_e = 1.5` and `\\gamma = 1.4`:\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4 - 1}{2} (1.5)^2\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{1.4 - 1}}$$`\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.4}{2} (2.25)\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{0.4}}$$`\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = \\left(1 + 0.2 \\times 2.25\\right)^{3.5}$$`\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = \\left(1 + 0.45\\right)^{3.5}$$`\n`$$\\frac{P_0}{P_e} = (1.45)^{3.5} \\approx 3.6703$$`\n\nNow, solve for `P_e`:\n`$$P_e = \\frac{P_0}{3.6703} = \\frac{2 \\text{ atm}}{3.6703} \\approx 0.54489 \\text{ atm}$$`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, `P_e \\approx 0.545 \\text{ atm}`."
