      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the mass of propellant using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. Given the initial mass ($m_i = 10000$ kg), specific impulse ($I_{sp} = 450$ s), gravitational acceleration ($g_0 = 9.8$ m/s$^2$), and the required change in velocity ($\\Delta V = 11$ km/s = $11000$ m/s), we can determine the final mass ($m_f$) and then the propellant mass ($m_p$).\n\n1.  **Calculate the exhaust velocity ($v_e$):**\n    $v_e = g_0 \\cdot I_{sp} = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\cdot 450 \\text{ s} = 4410 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Apply the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation:**\n    $\\Delta V = v_e \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_i}{m_f}\\right)$\n    $11000 \\text{ m/s} = 4410 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{10000 \\text{ kg}}{m_f}\\right)$\n\n3.  **Solve for the mass ratio:**\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{10000}{m_f}\\right) = \\frac{11000}{4410} \\approx 2.494331$\n    $\\frac{10000}{m_f} = e^{2.494331} \\approx 12.1130$\n\n4.  **Calculate the final mass ($m_f$):**\n    $m_f = \\frac{10000}{12.1130} \\approx 825.55 \\text{ kg}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the mass of propellant ($m_p$):**\n    $m_p = m_i - m_f = 10000 \\text{ kg} - 825.55 \\text{ kg} = 9174.45 \\text{ kg}$\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the mass of propellant is approximately $9174.5$ kg. The highest-weighted model provided $9174.7$ kg, which is consistent within typical rounding variations and falls within the expected range of 9100.0 to 9200.0 kg."
