      "reasoning": "To find a vector v3 that is perpendicular to two given vectors v1 and v2, the most direct and fundamental method is to compute their cross product, v1 x v2. The resulting vector from a cross product is inherently orthogonal (perpendicular) to both of the original vectors. Option D, v3 = (v1 x v2) / |v1 x v2|, represents the unit vector in this direction, which is a valid answer to the question.\n\nLet's verify the cross product:\nGiven v1 = i + 3j = (1, 3, 0)\nGiven v2 = 2i - 4j + 3k = (2, -4, 3)\n\nThe cross product v1 x v2 is calculated using the determinant of a matrix:\nv1 x v2 = det([[i, j, k], [1, 3, 0], [2, -4, 3]])\n= i * ((3)(3) - (0)(-4))\n- j * ((1)(3) - (0)(2))\n+ k * ((1)(-4) - (3)(2))\n\n= i * (9 - 0)\n- j * (3 - 0)\n+ k * (-4 - 6)\n\n= 9i - 3j - 10k\n\nThis vector (9, -3, -10) is perpendicular to both v1 and v2. Option D provides the unit vector in this direction. Options A and C involve dot products and vector projections, which are used for different purposes and would not yield a vector perpendicular to both. Option B, v3 = k, is not perpendicular to v2 (as k . v2 = 3 != 0)."
