This leads to the conservation of angular momentum in the radial direction, a characteristic of 'free-vortex' flow. Therefore, the product of the radius (r) and the tangential component of the absolute velocity (V_w or c_theta) remains constant (r * V_w = constant). As the fluid flows radially outward (increasing r), its tangential velocity (V_w) decreases inversely to the radius to maintain this constant angular momentum."
