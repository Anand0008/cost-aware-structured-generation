  "question_text": "A conventional aircraft was analyzed to estimate the contribution of wing towards Cm0 (Cm at alpha=0) of the whole aircraft. The wing was installed with zero setting angle along the fuselage reference line. Further, the wing was laid such that X_ac,w = 0.3, and X_cg,aircraft = 0.4. X_ac,w and X_cg,aircraft are the non-dimensional distances, from the leading edge of the wing, of the aerodynamic center of the wing and center of gravity of the aircraft respectively. The wing had the following aerodynamic characteristics: C_L0 = 0.20, and C_mac,wing = -0.02. The numerical value of Cm0,w (contribution of the wing to Cm0) about the CG of the aircraft is ________ (in two decimal places).",
