      "reasoning": "This is a classic 'work and time' problem that can be solved using a system of linear equations. Let 'M' be the work rate of one man (fraction of bridge built per week) and 'W' be the work rate of one woman (fraction of bridge built per week).\n\nFrom the first statement:\n1200 men and 500 women build a bridge in 2 weeks. This means the total work done is 1 bridge. Using the formula Work = Rate × Time:\n$(1200M + 500W) \\times 2 = 1 \\implies 2400M + 1000W = 1$ (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the second statement:\n900 men and 250 women build the same bridge in 3 weeks. Similarly:\n$(900M + 250W) \\times 3 = 1 \\implies 2700M + 750W = 1$ (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1) $2400M + 1000W = 1$\n2) $2700M + 750W = 1$\n\nTo solve for 'M' and 'W', we can equate the right-hand sides since both equal 1:\n$2400M + 1000W = 2700M + 750W$\n$1000W - 750W = 2700M - 2400M$\n$250W = 300M$\n$W = \\frac{300}{250}M \\implies W = 1.2M$\n\nSubstitute $W = 1.2M$ into Equation 1:\n$2400M + 1000(1.2M) = 1$\n$2400M + 1200M = 1$\n$3600M = 1$\n\nThis gives us the work rate of one man: $M = \\frac{1}{3600}$ bridge/week/man.\n\nThe question asks: 'How many men will be needed to build the bridge in one week?'\nLet 'X' be the number of men required. The total work is 1 bridge, and the time is 1 week.\n$(X \\times M) \\times 1 = 1$\n$X \\times \\frac{1}{3600} = 1$\n$X = 3600$\n\nTherefore, 3600 men will be needed to build the bridge in one week. This matches option C."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define variables for the work rate of one man and one woman. Let M be the work rate per man per week, and W be the work rate per woman per week. The total work for one bridge is considered as 1 unit.",
        "Step 2: Formulate the first equation based on the first condition. Given that 1200 men and 500 women build a bridge in 2 weeks, the total work done is $(1200M + 500W) \\times 2 = 1$. This simplifies to $2400M + 1000W = 1$.",
        "Step 3: Formulate the second equation based on the second condition. Given that 900 men and 250 women build the same bridge in 3 weeks, the total work done is $(900M + 250W) \\times 3 = 1$. This simplifies to $2700M + 750W = 1$.",
        "Step 4: Solve the system of linear equations. Since both expressions equal 1, we can set them equal: $2400M + 1000W = 2700M + 750W$. Rearranging gives $250W = 300M$, which simplifies to $W = 1.2M$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute $W = 1.2M$ into the first equation ($2400M + 1000W = 1$): $2400M + 1000(1.2M) = 1 \\Rightarrow 2400M + 1200M = 1 \\Rightarrow 3600M = 1$. Therefore, $M = \\frac{1}{3600}$ bridge/week/man.",
        "Step 6: To determine the number of men (N) required to build the bridge in one week, use the work-rate-time relationship: $N \\times M \\times 1 \\text{ week} = 1 \\text{ bridge}$. Substitute the value of M: $N \\times \\frac{1}{3600} = 1 \\Rightarrow N = 3600$ men.",
