      "reasoning": "The neutral axis (NA) is fundamentally defined as the axis within a beam's cross-section where the normal bending stress is zero. This is a direct consequence of the linear strain distribution across the cross-section and the material being linearly elastic, leading to zero strain and thus zero stress at the neutral axis. This principle holds true regardless of whether the cross-section is symmetrical or unsymmetrical, as long as the beam is subjected to pure bending and the material is homogeneous and elastic. For unsymmetrical sections, the neutral axis may be inclined and does not necessarily coincide with the centroidal axis, but the normal stress at this axis remains zero.\nOption A is incorrect because for an unsymmetrical cross-section, the product of inertia ($I_{yz}$) is generally non-zero unless the coordinate axes happen to be principal axes.\nOption C is incorrect because shear stress along the neutral axis is not always zero; it is often maximum at the neutral axis for many common cross-sections (e.g., rectangular beams).\nOption D is poorly worded and combines incorrect and correct statements, making it generally false."

        "Understand the definition of the neutral axis in beam bending: it is the longitudinal axis within a beam's cross-section where the normal stress due to bending is zero (neither tension nor compression).",
        "Recognize that this definition of zero normal stress at the neutral axis holds universally for beams made of linear elastic, homogeneous materials, including cases of unsymmetrical bending. The neutral axis also represents the line where normal stresses transition from compression to tension.",
        "Apply the definition: at the neutral axis, the normal stress is zero. This is consistent with the flexure formula, where the stress is proportional to the distance from the neutral axis, and at the neutral axis itself, this distance is zero.",
        "Evaluate the given options. Option B states 'The normal stress along the neutral axis is always zero.' Based on the definition and principles of beam bending, this statement is fundamentally true.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'The shear stress along the neutral axis is always zero.' This is incorrect. Shear stress distribution is dependent on the cross-section and loading, and for many common cross-sections (e.g., rectangular), the shear stress is maximum at the neutral axis, not zero.",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'The product of second moment of area about the neutral axis is always zero.' This refers to the product of inertia (I_yz), which is generally non-zero for unsymmetrical sections unless the axes are principal axes. Therefore, this is false. Option D combines this false statement with the true statement about normal stress, making the overall statement incorrect."
