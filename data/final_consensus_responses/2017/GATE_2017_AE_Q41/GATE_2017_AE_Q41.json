      "reasoning": "The Von Mises yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the equivalent stress ($\\sigma_v$) equals the uniaxial yield strength ($Y$). For a general 3D stress state, the equivalent stress is given by the formula: $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_z - \\sigma_x)^2 ] + 3 (\\tau_{xy}^2 + \\tau_{yz}^2 + \\tau_{zx}^2) }$. Given $Y = 330 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_x = 140 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_y = -70 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = x \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{zx} = 0$. Substituting these values into the criterion: $330^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [ (140 - (-70))^2 + (-70 - 0)^2 + (0 - 140)^2 ] + 3 (x^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)$. This simplifies to $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ (210)^2 + (-70)^2 + (-140)^2 ] + 3x^2$. Further calculation yields $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 44100 + 4900 + 19600 ] + 3x^2$, which becomes $108900 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 68600 ] + 3x^2$. So, $108900 = 34300 + 3x^2$. Solving for $x^2$: $3x^2 = 108900 - 34300 = 74600$. Thus, $x^2 = \\frac{74600}{3} \\approx 24866.6667$. Finally, $x = \\sqrt{24866.6667} \\approx 157.6916 \\text{ MN/m}^2$. Rounded to three decimal places, $x \\approx 157.692 \\text{ MN/m}^2$."

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters. Uniaxial yield stress $Y = 330 \\text{ MN/m}^2$. The stress state components are $\\sigma_x = 140 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_y = -70 \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\sigma_z = 0$, $\\tau_{xy} = x \\text{ MN/m}^2$, $\\tau_{yz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{zx} = 0$. \n\nStep 2: Apply the Von Mises yield criterion. The Von Mises equivalent stress ($\\sigma_v$) for a general 3D stress state is given by:\n$\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}[(\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_z - \\sigma_x)^2] + 3(\\tau_{xy}^2 + \\tau_{yz}^2 + \\tau_{zx}^2)}$.\nAccording to the Von Mises criterion, yielding occurs when $\\sigma_v = Y$. So, set $\\sigma_v = 330 \\text{ MN/m}^2$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given values into the Von Mises equation:\n$330^2 = \\frac{1}{2}[ (140 - (-70))^2 + (-70 - 0)^2 + (0 - 140)^2 ] + 3(x^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)$\n$108900 = \\frac{1}{2}[ (210)^2 + (-70)^2 + (-140)^2 ] + 3x^2$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the squared differences and their sum:\n$(210)^2 = 44100$\n$(-70)^2 = 4900$\n$(-140)^2 = 19600$\nSum: $44100 + 4900 + 19600 = 68600$\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation and solve for $x^2$:\n$108900 = \\frac{1}{2}[68600] + 3x^2$\n$108900 = 34300 + 3x^2$\n$3x^2 = 108900 - 34300$\n$3x^2 = 74600$\n$x^2 = \\frac{74600}{3} \\approx 24866.6667$\n\nStep 6: Calculate $x$ and round to three decimal places:\n$x = \\sqrt{24866.6667} \\approx 157.69162 \\text{ MN/m}^2$\nRounding to three decimal places, $x \\approx 157.692 \\text{ MN/m}^2$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the Von Mises yield criterion formula for a general 3D stress state in terms of normal and shear stress components: $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{2} [ (\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_z - \\sigma_x)^2 ] + 3 (\\tau_{xy}^2 + \\tau_{yz}^2 + \\tau_{zx}^2) }$.",
        "Step 3: Set the Von Mises equivalent stress $\\sigma_v$ equal to the uniaxial yield stress $Y$ to establish the yielding condition: $\\sigma_v = Y$, or $\\sigma_v^2 = Y^2$. This gives the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}[(\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_z - \\sigma_x)^2] + 3(\\tau_{xy}^2 + \\tau_{yz}^2 + \\tau_{zx}^2) = Y^2$.",

The equation becomes: $\\frac{1}{2}[(140 - (-70))^2 + (-70 - 0)^2 + (0 - 140)^2] + 3x^2 = 330^2$.",
        "Step 5: Compute each squared difference: $(140 + 70)^2 = 210^2 = 44100$, $(-70)^2 = 4900$, $(-140)^2 = 19600$. Sum these values: $44100 + 4900 + 19600 = 68600$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the sum back into the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}(68600) + 3x^2 = 330^2$. This simplifies to $34300 + 3x^2 = 108900$ (since $330^2 = 108900$).",
        "Step 7: Solve for $x^2$: $3x^2 = 108900 - 34300 = 74600$, so $x^2 = 74600 / 3 = 24866.\\overline{666}$.",
