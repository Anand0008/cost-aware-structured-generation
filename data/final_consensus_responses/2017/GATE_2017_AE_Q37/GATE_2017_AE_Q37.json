      "reasoning": "The problem requires applying the principle of dynamic similarity to relate the forces on a model and a prototype. For low-speed flow (100 km/h is approximately 27.8 m/s, which is well below Mach 0.3), compressibility effects are negligible, and dynamic similarity is primarily achieved by matching the Reynolds number ($Re$) between the model (m) and the prototype (p).\n\n1.  **Convert Prototype Velocity:**\n    $V_p = 100 \\text{ km/h} = 100 \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 27.777... \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Reynolds Number Matching:**\n    $Re_m = Re_p$\n    $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p}$\n    From this, the velocity ratio can be expressed as:\n    $\\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)$\n\n3.  **Aerodynamic Force Coefficient Equality:**\n    For dynamic similarity, the dimensionless force coefficients (e.g., drag coefficient $C_D$ or a general force coefficient $C_F$) are equal:\n    $C_F_m = C_F_p$\n    The force coefficient is defined as $C_F = \\frac{F}{0.5 \\rho V^2 S}$, where $S$ is the reference area. So,\n    $\\frac{F_m}{0.5 \\rho_m V_m^2 S_m} = \\frac{F_p}{0.5 \\rho_p V_p^2 S_p}$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Forces:**\n    Rearranging the force coefficient equality gives the ratio of forces:\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_m}{V_p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{S_m}{S_p} \\right)$\n\n5.  **Area Scaling:**\n    For geometric similarity, the area scales with the square of the linear dimension:\n    $\\frac{S_m}{S_p} = \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    Given $L_m/L_p = 1/4$, so $S_m/S_p = (1/4)^2 = 1/16$.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Substitute the expression for $V_m/V_p$ from step 2 and $S_m/S_p$ from step 5 into the force ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right) \\right]^2 \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{L_p}{L_m} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$\n    The terms involving $L_m/L_p$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Plug in Values:**\n    Given:\n    $\\rho_p = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_p = 1.78 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$\n    $\\rho_m = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_m = 10^{-3} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$\n\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\left( \\frac{1.22}{1000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{-3}}{1.78 \\times 10^{-5}} \\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = 0.00122 \\times (56.179775...)^2$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = 0.00122 \\times 3156.168089...$\n    $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} \\approx 3.8505$\n\n8.  **Round to Nearest Integer:**\n    The ratio of the model force to the prototype force is approximately 4."

        "Identify the given data for the prototype (flight) and model (wind tunnel), including fluid properties, and recognize that dynamic similarity for low-speed flow requires matching the Reynolds number.",
        "Apply the principle of dynamic similarity by equating the Reynolds numbers for the model and prototype: $Re_m = Re_p$, which means $\\frac{\\rho_m V_m L_m}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{\\rho_p V_p L_p}{\\mu_p}$.",
        "Rearrange the Reynolds number equality to express the ratio of model velocity to prototype velocity: $\\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\frac{L_p}{L_m}$.",
        "Recall the general formula for aerodynamic force, $F = C_F \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 A$, where $A$ is the characteristic area and $A \\propto L^2$ for geometrically similar bodies.",
        "Form the ratio of the model force to the prototype force: $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\frac{C_{F,m} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_m V_m^2 A_m}{C_{F,p} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_p V_p^2 A_p}$. Since $C_{F,m} = C_{F,p}$ and $A_m/A_p = (L_m/L_p)^2$, this simplifies to $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\rho_p} \\left( \\frac{V_m}{V_p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{L_m}{L_p} \\right)^2$.",
        "Substitute the expression for the velocity ratio (from Step 2) into the force ratio equation (from Step 4) and simplify. The length scale terms $(L_m/L_p)$ will cancel out, leading to $\\frac{F_m}{F_p} = \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_m} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\mu_p} \\right)^2$.",
        "Substitute the given numerical values for densities ($\\rho_p = 1.22 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $\\rho_m = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) and dynamic viscosities ($\\mu_p = 1.78 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$, $\\mu_m = 10^{-3} \\text{ N-s/m}^2$) into the simplified force ratio formula.",
        "Calculate the result: $F_m/F_p = (1.22/1000) \\times (10^{-3}/(1.78 \\times 10^{-5}))^2 \\approx 0.00122 \\times (56.1798)^2 \\approx 0.00122 \\times 3156.17 \\approx 3.85$. Round this to the nearest integer, which is 4."
