      "reasoning": "The question describes a loss mechanism involving the 'turning of the wall boundary layer through an angle due to curved surface'. This precisely matches the definition of secondary flow loss. Secondary flows are complex, three-dimensional viscous effects that occur near the end walls (hub and casing) of turbomachinery blades. They arise from the interaction between the main flow, which is being turned by the blades, and the low-energy boundary layer fluid on the end walls. The pressure gradient across the blade channel causes this low-momentum boundary layer fluid to be pushed sideways, forming dissipative streamwise vortices. This leads to significant energy loss. Other options like profile loss (2D effect), annulus loss (skin friction on end-walls), and tip clearance loss (leakage flow) describe different mechanisms."

        "Recall the primary aerodynamic loss mechanisms in axial turbomachinery: Profile loss, Annulus loss, Secondary flow loss, and Tip clearance loss.",
        "Evaluate other loss types: Profile loss (associated with the two-dimensional shape of the blade and boundary layer growth/separation on blade surfaces), Annulus loss (due to viscous friction on stationary end walls), and Tip clearance loss (due to leakage of fluid through the gap between blade tip and casing) do not match the description of turning of the wall boundary layer.",
        "Identify Secondary flow loss: This is a three-dimensional effect near the end walls, caused by the interaction of the main flow's pressure gradient with the low-momentum fluid in the wall boundary layers. This interaction causes the wall boundary layer fluid to migrate from the pressure side to the suction side of the blade passage, effectively 'turning' or deflecting it, and forming dissipative secondary vortices. This description perfectly matches the phenomenon stated in the question.",

The main flow experiences a pressure gradient across the blade channel, pushing low-momentum fluid sideways from the pressure side towards the suction side of the adjacent blade. This cross-flow rolls up into streamwise vortices, known as secondary vortices. These secondary flows are particularly detrimental as they redistribute low-energy fluid, increasing the likelihood of flow separation on the suction surface and causing significant energy dissipation."
