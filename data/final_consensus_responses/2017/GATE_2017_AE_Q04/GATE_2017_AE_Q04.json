      "reasoning": "The problem is a regular Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem. We need to find the values of \\(\\lambda\\) (eigenvalues) for which non-trivial solutions \\(y(x)\\) (eigenfunctions) exist, satisfying the given differential equation and boundary conditions.\n\nThe given differential equation is \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + k^2 \\lambda y = 0\\) with boundary conditions \\(y(0) = 0\\) and \\(y(1) = 0\\).\n\nLet's analyze the cases for \\(k^2 \\lambda\\):\n\n1.  **Case 1: \\(k^2 \\lambda = 0\\) (i.e., \\(\\lambda = 0\\))**\n    The ODE becomes \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0\\). Integrating twice, the general solution is \\(y(x) = Ax + B\\). Applying \\(y(0) = 0 \\implies B = 0\\). Applying \\(y(1) = 0 \\implies A = 0\\). This leads to the trivial solution \\(y(x) = 0\\). Thus, \\(\\lambda = 0\\) is not an eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Case 2: \\(k^2 \\lambda < 0\\) (i.e., \\(\\lambda < 0\\))**\n    Let \\(k^2 \\lambda = -\\alpha^2\\) for some real \\(\\alpha > 0\\). The ODE becomes \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - \\alpha^2 y = 0\\). The general solution is \\(y(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\alpha x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)\\). Applying \\(y(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0\\). So, \\(y(x) = C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha x)\\). Applying \\(y(1) = 0 \\implies C_2 \\sinh(\\alpha) = 0\\). Since \\(\\alpha > 0\\), \\(\\sinh(\\alpha)\\) is never zero. Therefore, \\(C_2\\) must be \\(0\\). This leads to the trivial solution \\(y(x) = 0\\). Thus, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n3.  **Case 3: \\(k^2 \\lambda > 0\\) (i.e., \\(\\lambda > 0\\))**\n    Let \\(k^2 \\lambda = \\mu^2\\) for some real \\(\\mu > 0\\). The ODE becomes \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + \\mu^2 y = 0\\). The general solution is \\(y(x) = A \\cos(\\mu x) + B \\sin(\\mu x)\\).\n    Applying the first boundary condition \\(y(0) = 0 \\implies A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0\\). So, the solution simplifies to \\(y(x) = B \\sin(\\mu x)\\).\n    Applying the second boundary condition \\(y(1) = 0 \\implies B \\sin(\\mu) = 0\\). For a non-trivial solution (i.e., \\(y(x)\\) is not identically zero), \\(B\\) must be non-zero. Therefore, we must have \\(\\sin(\\mu) = 0\\).\n    This implies that \\(\\mu\\) must be an integer multiple of \\(\\pi\\), i.e., \\(\\mu = n\\pi\\) for some integer \\(n\\). Since we assumed \\(\\mu > 0\\), we consider \\(n = 1, 2, 3, ...\\).\n\n    Now, we find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_n\\) using \\(k^2 \\lambda = \\mu^2\\):\n    \\(\\lambda_n = \\frac{\\mu^2}{k^2} = \\frac{(n\\pi)^2}{k^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{k^2}\\).\n\n    The corresponding eigenfunctions \\(u_n(x)\\) (choosing \\(B = 1\\) for simplicity) are:\n    \\(u_n(x) = \\sin(\\mu x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)\\).\n\nComparing these results with the given options, Option C provides the correct eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{k^2}\\) and eigenfunctions \\(u_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)\\). The range \\(n = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...\\) in the option is a general way to list the index, but for distinct non-trivial eigenfunctions, \\(n = 1, 2, 3, ...\\) is typically considered."

For Dirichlet conditions ($y(0)=0, y(L)=0$), expect sine functions and use the pattern $\\mu=n\\pi$ to find $\\lambda_n$. For Neumann conditions ($y'(0)=0, y'(L)=0$), expect cosine functions (including constant for $n=0$). This should take 2-3 minutes.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, eliminate options where the eigenfunction argument is incorrect (e.g., $\\sin(\\lambda_n x)$ or $\\sin(k n \\pi x)$ instead of $n\\pi x$). Also, check if $\\lambda_n$ scales as $n^2 \\pi^2 / k^2$. If options are given, eliminate those where the eigenfunction has 'k' in the argument or $\\lambda_n$ is missing $k^2$ in the denominator.",
