The mass 'm' is suspended by two identical springs, each with stiffness 'k', making an angle of 45 degrees with the horizontal. For a small vertical displacement 'x' of the mass, the extension of each spring along its axis is \\Delta L = x \\sin(45^\\circ). The restoring force from each spring along its axis is F_s = k \\Delta L = k x \\sin(45^\\circ). The vertical component of this restoring force from one spring is F_v = F_s \\sin(45^\\circ) = k x \\sin^2(45^\\circ). Since there are two such springs, the total equivalent stiffness k_{eq} = 2k \\sin^2(45^\\circ). Given \\sin(45^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}, then \\sin^2(45^\\circ) = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2. Therefore, k_{eq} = 2k (1/2) = k. Substituting this into the natural frequency formula, \\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}. Comparing this with the given form \\omega_n = a \\sqrt{k/m}, we find that a = 1.00. This value falls within the specified range of 0.95 to 1.05. This derivation assumes small displacements and that the springs are unstretched at equilibrium."

        "Understand the system: A mass m is attached to two identical springs of stiffness k, each making an angle of 45° with the horizontal. The mass is constrained to move vertically (small displacement).",
        "Consider a small vertical downward displacement 'x' of the mass from its equilibrium position.",
        "Due to this vertical displacement 'x', each spring will experience an extension. For a small vertical displacement 'x' and an angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ with the horizontal, the component of this displacement along the axis of each spring is $x \\sin(\\theta)$.",
        "The force developed in each spring is $F_s = k \\times (x \\sin(\\theta))$ according to Hooke's Law.",
        "The vertical component of this spring force, which contributes to the restoring force on the mass, is $F_{s,vertical} = F_s \\sin(\\theta) = k (x \\sin(\\theta)) \\sin(\\theta) = kx \\sin^2(\\theta)$.",
        "Since there are two identical springs acting symmetrically, the total vertical restoring force is $F_{total} = 2 \\times F_{s,vertical} = 2kx \\sin^2(\\theta)$. By definition, $F_{total} = k_{eq}x$, so the equivalent vertical stiffness is $k_{eq} = 2k \\sin^2(\\theta)$.",
        "Substitute the given angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$. We know that $\\sin(45^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $\\sin^2(45^\\circ) = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$.",
        "Calculate the numerical value of $k_{eq}$: $k_{eq} = 2k (1/2) = k$.",
        "Write the equation of motion for the system using Newton's Second Law for undamped free vibration: $m \\ddot{x} + k_{eq}x = 0$. Substituting $k_{eq} = k$, we get $m \\ddot{x} + kx = 0$.",
        "Determine the natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$) from the equation of motion. The standard form is $\\ddot{x} + \\omega_n^2 x = 0$, so $\\omega_n^2 = k_{eq}/m$. Thus, $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k_{eq}/m}$.",
        "Substitute the calculated $k_{eq}$ into the natural frequency formula: $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$. Comparing this result with the given form $\\omega_n = a \\sqrt{k/m}$, we find the value of 'a' is $1$."

For θ=45°, $a=1$, making it a quick solve.",
