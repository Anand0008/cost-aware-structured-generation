Using the definition $\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\delta} (u/U)(1 - u/U) dy$, substitute the velocity profile. Let $\\eta = y/\\delta$, so $dy = \\delta d\\eta$. The integral becomes $\\theta = \\delta \\int_{0}^{1} (\\eta - \\eta^2) d\\eta$. Evaluating the integral: $\\theta = \\delta \\left[ \\frac{\\eta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\eta^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)$.
