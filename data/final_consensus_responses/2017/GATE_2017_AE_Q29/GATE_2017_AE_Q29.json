      "reasoning": "The given equation of motion for the rod is a linear, homogeneous partial differential equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - 25 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$. This is a one-dimensional wave equation of the form $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$, where $c^2 = 25$, so the wave speed $c = 5$. The boundary conditions are $u(0, t) = 0$ and $u(1, t) = 0$, indicating fixed ends for a rod of length $L = 1$. The general solution for the 1D wave equation with fixed ends, obtained using separation of variables, is given by: $u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) [A_n \\cos(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L}) + B_n \\sin(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L})]$. Substituting $L=1$ and $c=5$: $u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [A_n \\cos(5n\\pi t) + B_n \\sin(5n\\pi t)]$. Now, apply the initial conditions: 1. Initial velocity: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$. Differentiating $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [-5n\\pi A_n \\sin(5n\\pi t) + 5n\\pi B_n \\cos(5n\\pi t)]$. At $t=0$: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(n\\pi x) [5n\\pi B_n] = 0$. This implies $5n\\pi B_n = 0$ for all $n$, so $B_n = 0$. The solution simplifies to: $u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\cos(5n\\pi t)$. 2. Initial displacement: $u(x, 0) = 0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi x)$. At $t=0$: $u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\cos(0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$. Comparing this with the given initial displacement, $0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi x)$, we find by inspection that only the term for $n=10$ is non-zero, and $A_{10} = 0.01$. All other $A_n = 0$. Thus, the specific solution for $u(x,t)$ is: $u(x,t) = 0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi x) \\cos(50 \\pi t)$. Finally, evaluate $u(0.25, 1)$: $u(0.25, 1) = 0.01 \\sin(10 \\pi \\cdot 0.25) \\cos(50 \\pi \\cdot 1)$. Evaluate the trigonometric terms: $\\sin(2.5 \\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi + 0.5\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. $\\cos(50 \\pi) = \\cos(25 \\cdot 2\\pi) = 1$ (since $\\cos(2k\\pi) = 1$ for any integer $k$). Substitute these values back: $u(0.25, 1) = 0.01 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 0.01$. In three decimal places, the value is $0.010$."

        "Step 1: Identify the governing partial differential equation (PDE) as a one-dimensional wave equation. Compare the given equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - 25 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$, with the standard form $u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}$ to determine the wave speed. From $c^2 = 25$, we find $c = 5$ m/s.",
        "Step 2: Recognize the boundary conditions: $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(1,t)=0$, which indicate fixed ends for a rod of length $L = 1$ m. Identify the initial conditions: $u(x,0)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)$ (initial displacement) and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)=0$ (initial velocity).",
        "Step 3: Recall the general solution for the one-dimensional wave equation on a finite interval [0,L] with fixed ends, typically obtained using the method of separation of variables: $u(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\left[A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right)+B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right)\\right]$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the initial conditions to determine the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$. For the initial displacement, $u(x,0)=\\sum A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)$ (since $L=1$). By direct comparison, this implies $A_{10}=0.01$ and $A_n=0$ for all $n\\neq10$. For the initial velocity, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)=\\sum B_n n\\pi c \\sin(n\\pi x)=0$. This implies $B_n=0$ for all $n$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the determined coefficients ($A_{10}=0.01$, $A_n=0$ for $n\\neq10$, and all $B_n=0$) and the wave speed $c=5$ (with $L=1$) into the general solution. This yields the specific solution for the problem: $u(x,t)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)\\cos(10\\pi \\cdot 5 t) = 0.01\\sin(10\\pi x)\\cos(50\\pi t)$.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate the specific solution at the requested point $(x,t)=(0.25,1)$. Substitute these values into the solution: $u(0.25,1)=0.01\\sin(10\\pi \\times 0.25)\\cos(50\\pi \\times 1)$.",
        "Step 7: Compute the trigonometric terms: $\\sin(10\\pi \\times 0.25) = \\sin(2.5\\pi) = \\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}) = 1$. And $\\cos(50\\pi \\times 1) = \\cos(50\\pi) = \\cos(2\\pi \\times 25) = 1$.",
        "Step 8: Perform the final multiplication: $u(0.25,1) = 0.01 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0.01$. Expressing this to three decimal places, the displacement is 0.010."
