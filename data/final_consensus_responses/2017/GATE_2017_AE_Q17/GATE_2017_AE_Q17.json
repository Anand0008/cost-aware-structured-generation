      "reasoning": "The maximum gas flow rate that can be handled by a multistage axial compressor at a given rotational speed is dictated by choking. Choking occurs when the flow at some point within the compressor (typically the diffuser throat or blade passages) reaches sonic velocity (Mach 1). Once this condition is met, no further increase in mass flow rate is possible, even if the downstream pressure is reduced. This phenomenon sets the absolute upper limit for mass flow on the compressor performance map, forming its right-hand boundary. Compressor surge and rotating stall, on the other hand, are instability phenomena that occur at low mass flow rates, limiting the compressor's operating range on the left side of the map, and thus do not determine the maximum flow rate. The optimum design pressure ratio is a design parameter and not an operational limit on maximum flow."

        "Understand the implication: Once the flow is choked, the mass flow rate through that section cannot be increased further, regardless of changes in downstream pressure. This physically limits the maximum mass flow rate the compressor can process.",
        "Evaluate other options: Compressor surge and rotating stall are instabilities occurring at low mass flow rates, not limiting the maximum flow. Optimum design pressure ratio is a design target, not a physical operational limit on flow rate.",
