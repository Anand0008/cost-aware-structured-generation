      "confidence_type": "single_model",
      "reasoning": "Option C states that 'The location of transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer depends **only** on the operating Reynolds number.' This statement is NOT true. While the Reynolds number ($Re$) is a primary parameter influencing boundary layer transition, it is not the sole factor. The transition point also depends heavily on other factors such as surface roughness, freestream turbulence levels, pressure gradients, and Mach number. The word 'only' makes this statement incorrect.\n\nLet's validate the other options:\n*   **Option A:** 'Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent boundary layer is more desirable on a wing operating at large angle of attack.' This is TRUE. Turbulent boundary layers are more resistant to flow separation due to increased momentum transfer. At large angles of attack, strong adverse pressure gradients occur, making the boundary layer prone to separation and stall. A turbulent boundary layer can delay this separation, thus maintaining lift and delaying stall.\n*   **Option B:** 'The skin friction drag for a turbulent boundary layer is larger than that for a laminar boundary layer.' This is TRUE. Turbulent boundary layers are characterized by chaotic, unsteady motion and higher momentum transfer, leading to greater shear stress at the wall and consequently higher skin friction drag compared to laminar boundary layers at the same Reynolds number and location.\n*   **Option D:** 'A separated flow does not necessarily lead to a turbulent boundary layer.' This is TRUE. Flow separation can occur for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. In fact, laminar boundary layers are more prone to separation under adverse pressure gradients. If a laminar boundary layer separates, it remains a laminar separated flow at the point of separation. Turbulence might develop in the separated shear layer further downstream, but the separation event itself does not automatically imply the boundary layer was or immediately became turbulent."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the objective of the question, which is to identify the statement that is factually incorrect among the given options regarding boundary layer characteristics. Therefore, three statements must be true and one false.",
        "Step 2: Evaluate Option A: 'Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent boundary layer is more desirable on a wing operating at large angle of attack.' At large angles of attack, wings experience significant adverse pressure gradients. A turbulent boundary layer, due to its higher momentum mixing, is more resistant to flow separation, delaying stall and maintaining lift. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Option B: 'The skin friction drag for a turbulent boundary layer is larger than that for a laminar boundary layer.' Turbulent flow involves more mixing and higher shear stresses at the wall, resulting in a significantly higher skin friction drag compared to laminar flow at the same Reynolds number. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option C: 'The location of transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer depends only on the operating Reynolds number.' This statement is an oversimplification and incorrect. While the Reynolds number is a primary parameter, transition is also critically influenced by surface roughness, freestream turbulence intensity, pressure gradients (favorable or adverse), Mach number, heat transfer, and acoustic disturbances. Therefore, this statement is NOT TRUE.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option D: 'A separated flow does not necessarily lead to a turbulent boundary layer.' Flow separation can occur for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Laminar boundary layers are more susceptible to separation. A separated laminar flow does not automatically become turbulent at the point of separation; the separated shear layer may later transition. Hence, this statement is TRUE.",
        "Step 6: Conclude based on the analysis: Since Option C is the only statement identified as NOT true, it is the correct answer to the question."
