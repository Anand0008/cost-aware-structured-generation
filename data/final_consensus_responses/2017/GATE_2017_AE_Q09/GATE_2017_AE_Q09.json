      "reasoning": "The problem describes a steady one-dimensional flow of a perfect gas with heat transfer in a duct. We are given a T-s diagram showing static (A, B) and stagnation ($A_t$, $B_t$) conditions, and the condition that $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$, where $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$.\n\n1.  **Relate $\\Delta T$ to Mach number (M) and static temperature (T):**\n    The fundamental isentropic relation between stagnation temperature ($T_0$) and static temperature ($T$) for a perfect gas is:\n    $$\\frac{T_0}{T} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n    Rearranging this to express $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$:\n    $$\\frac{T_0 - T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n    Therefore, $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$$\n\n2.  **Apply the given condition $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$:**\n    Let $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B = \\Delta T_{common}$.\n    For location A: $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_A} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_A^2$\n    For location B: $\\frac{\\Delta T_{common}}{T_B} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_B^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the relationship between $M_A$ and $M_B$:**\n    Divide the equation for A by the equation for B:\n    $$\\frac{(\\Delta T_{common}/T_A)}{(\\Delta T_{common}/T_B)} = \\frac{(\\gamma - 1)/2 \\cdot M_A^2}{(\\gamma - 1)/2 \\cdot M_B^2}$$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2}$$\n    From the T-s diagram, it is clear that the static temperature at A is lower than at B ($T_A < T_B$). Therefore, $\\frac{T_B}{T_A} > 1$.\n    Substituting this into the derived relation:\n    $$\\frac{M_A^2}{M_B^2} > 1 \\implies M_A^2 > M_B^2 \\implies M_A > M_B$$ \n    (Since Mach numbers are positive).\n\n4.  **Determine the flow regime (subsonic or supersonic):**\n    From the T-s diagram, as the flow proceeds from A to B:\n    *   Static temperature ($T$) increases ($T_A < T_B$).\n    *   Entropy ($s$) increases ($s_A < s_B$).\n    *   Stagnation temperature ($T_0$) increases ($T_{0A} < T_{0B}$, as $T_{0A} = T_A + (\\Delta T)_A$ and $T_{0B} = T_B + (\\Delta T)_B$, and $T_A < T_B$ while $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$). An increase in stagnation temperature indicates heat addition to the flow.\n    *   We have already established that the Mach number decreases ($M_A > M_B$).\n\n    Now, consider the effect of heat addition on Mach number and static temperature for a perfect gas in a constant area duct (similar to Rayleigh flow behavior):\n    *   **Subsonic flow (M < 1) with heat addition:** Static temperature ($T$) increases, and Mach number ($M$) increases towards 1.\n    *   **Supersonic flow (M > 1) with heat addition:** Static temperature ($T$) increases, but Mach number ($M$) decreases towards 1.\n\n    Since the flow from A to B shows an increase in static temperature ($T$) and a decrease in Mach number ($M$), the flow must be **supersonic**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the findings, the flow is supersonic and $M_A > M_B$. This corresponds to option B."

        "Identify the key information from the problem statement and the T-s diagram. The diagram shows static (A, B) and stagnation ($A_t$, $B_t$) conditions. The problem states that the difference between stagnation and static temperature, $\\Delta T = T_0 - T$, is the same at both locations A and B, i.e., $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$.",
        "Recall the fundamental compressible flow relation between stagnation temperature ($T_0$), static temperature ($T$), and Mach number ($M$) for a perfect gas: $\\frac{T_0}{T} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$.",
        "Express the temperature difference $\\Delta T$ in terms of static temperature and Mach number. From the relation in Step 1, we have $\\frac{T_0 - T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2$.",
        "Apply the given condition $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$. This implies $T_A \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_A^2 = T_B \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_B^2$, which simplifies to $T_A M_A^2 = T_B M_B^2$.",
        "Analyze the T-s diagram to determine the relationship between $T_A$ and $T_B$. The diagram clearly shows that the static temperature at A is lower than at B ($T_A < T_B$).",
        "From the relation $T_A M_A^2 = T_B M_B^2$ and $T_A < T_B$, it must be that $M_A^2 > M_B^2$. Taking the square root (Mach numbers are positive), we get $M_A > M_B$.",
        "Determine the flow regime. The T-s diagram shows that entropy increases from A to B (moving right), indicating heat addition to the flow. Also, since $T_0 = T + \\Delta T$ and $T_A < T_B$ with $(\\Delta T)_A = (\\Delta T)_B$, it means $T_{0A} < T_{0B}$, which also confirms heat addition.",
        "Apply Rayleigh flow principles: For flow with heat addition, an increase in static temperature ($T_A < T_B$) accompanied by a decrease in Mach number ($M_A > M_B$) is characteristic of supersonic flow. (In subsonic flow with heat addition, both T and M would increase).",
        "Conclude that the flow is supersonic and $M_A > M_B$."
