        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and the unknown. The period of Earth is $\\tau_E = 365.256$ days, the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit is $a_E = 1.4953 \\times 10^{11}$ m, and the semi-major axis of Mars's orbit is $a_M = 2.2783 \\times 10^{11}$ m. We need to find the orbital period of Mars ($\\tau_M$).",
        "Step 2: Recall Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis for any two bodies orbiting the same central mass.",
        "Step 3: Write Kepler's Third Law in ratio form for Earth (E) and Mars (M) and rearrange it to solve for the unknown period: $(\\tau_M / \\tau_E)^2 = (a_M / a_E)^3 \\implies \\tau_M = \\tau_E \\times (a_M / a_E)^{3/2}$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the given numerical values into the rearranged formula: $\\tau_M = 365.256 \\text{ days} \\times (2.2783 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ m} / 1.4953 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ m})^{3/2}$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes: $a_M / a_E = 2.2783 / 1.4953 \\approx 1.5235$.",
        "Step 6: Raise this ratio to the power of $3/2$: $(1.5235)^{1.5} \\approx 1.8808$.",
        "Step 7: Multiply this result by Earth's orbital period to find Mars's orbital period: $\\tau_M = 365.256 \\text{ days} \\times 1.8808 \\approx 686.99$ days.",
