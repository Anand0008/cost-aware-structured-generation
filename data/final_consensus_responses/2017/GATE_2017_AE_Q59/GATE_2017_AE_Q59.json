      "reasoning": "The problem involves tracking the position of Fatima using vector addition and subtraction in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. By setting point P as the origin (0,0), each movement can be represented as a vector. \n1.  **Movement 1 (P to Q):** 3 km North (vector `(0, 3)`) then 4 km East (vector `(4, 0)`). So, Q is at `(0+4, 3+0) = (4, 3)` relative to P.\n2.  **Movement 2 (from Q towards P for 15 km):** From Q `(4, 3)`, she turns to face P `(0, 0)`. The vector from Q to P is `\\vec{QP} = P - Q = (0-4, 0-3) = (-4, -3)`. The magnitude of `\\vec{QP}` is `\\|\\vec{QP}\\| = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5` km. The unit vector in this direction is `\\hat{u}_{QP} = \\frac{1}{5}(-4, -3)`. She travels 15 km in this direction, which is `3 \\times \\|\\vec{QP}\\|`. So, the displacement vector for this leg is `15 \\times \\hat{u}_{QP} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{5}(-4, -3) = 3(-4, -3) = (-12, -9)`. Her new position `Q'` is `Q + (-12, -9) = (4, 3) + (-12, -9) = (-8, -6)`.\n3.  **Movement 3 (from Q' North for 6 km):** From `Q' (-8, -6)`, she goes 6 km North (vector `(0, 6)`). Her final position `F` is `(-8, -6) + (0, 6) = (-8, 0)`.\n4.  **Distance from P:** Her final position is `(-8, 0)` and P is `(0, 0)`. The distance is `\\sqrt{(-8-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8` km.\n5.  **Direction to reach P:** From her final position `(-8, 0)`, to reach P `(0, 0)`, she needs to move along the vector `P - F = (0 - (-8), 0 - 0) = (8, 0)`. This vector points purely in the positive x-direction, which corresponds to East. \nTherefore, she is 8 km from point P, and should go East to reach P."
