        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle as the First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady-flow open system (combustor with constant-pressure heat addition). Identify the given parameters: inlet stagnation temperature ($T_{t3} = 450$ K), mass flow rates of air ($\\dot{m}_a = 50$ kg/s) and fuel ($\\dot{m}_f = 1$ kg/s), heating value of fuel ($Q_R = 44$ MJ/kg), specific heats for air ($c_{p_a} = 1.005$ kJ/kg\\u00b7K) and combustion products ($c_{p_g} = 1.147$ kJ/kg\\u00b7K), and burner efficiency ($\\eta_b = 1$, assumed 100%).",
        "Step 2: Write the energy balance equation for the combustor. The energy entering with the air plus the heat released by the fuel (adjusted for efficiency) must equal the energy leaving with the combustion products. The mass flow rate of the products is the sum of air and fuel mass flow rates. The general formula is: $\\dot{m}_a c_{p_a} T_{t3} + \\dot{m}_f \\eta_b Q_R = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} T_{t4}$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the given numerical values into the energy balance equation. Convert the fuel heating value from MJ/kg to kJ/kg ($44 \\text{ MJ/kg} = 44000 \\text{ kJ/kg}$). The equation becomes: $50 \\times 1.005 \\times 450 + 1 \\times 1 \\times 44000 = (50 + 1) \\times 1.147 \\times T_{t4}$.",
        "Step 4: Perform the calculations for both sides of the equation:\nLeft Hand Side (Energy In): $22612.5 + 44000 = 66612.5$ kJ/s.\nRight Hand Side (Energy Out): $51 \\times 1.147 \\times T_{t4} = 58.497 \\times T_{t4}$ kJ/s.",
        "Step 5: Equate the energy input to the energy output and solve for the exit stagnation temperature ($T_{t4}$):\n$66612.5 = 58.497 \\times T_{t4}$\n$T_{t4} = \\frac{66612.5}{58.497} \\approx 1138.605$ K.",
