(e.g., $T_{03} = 500 K$, $T_{04} = 1800 K$, $C_p = 1.005 kJ/kg-K$, $QR = 44 MJ/kg$).",
        "Write the steady-flow energy balance equation for the combustor, assuming negligible kinetic and potential energy changes, and constant specific heat: $\\dot{m}_a C_p T_{03} + \\dot{m}_f QR = (\\dot{m}_a + \\dot{m}_f) C_p T_{04}$.",

Rearrange to solve for f: $f(QR - C_p T_{04}) = C_p (T_{04} - T_{03})$. Thus, $f = \\frac{C_p (T_{04} - T_{03})}{QR - C_p T_{04}}$.",
