      "reasoning": "The official answer key states option B (5760 N.cm) is correct. Without the complete problem statement (diagram and full conditions), a definitive independent calculation cannot be performed. However, based on the context of GATE AE questions, this is likely a torsion problem in aircraft structures. The RAG context provides fundamental relationships like the differential equilibrium equation for distributed torque (dT/dz = -Ti(z)) and the torsion constant formula (J = st^3/3) for a rectangular strip. The answer likely comes from applying such relations, and thus the key is accepted as correct."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the system and loading. Understand the problem context, including the structural member (e.g., beam, shaft, thin-walled section), its geometry, material properties, and the nature of applied torsional loads. The value 'M' is the internal or applied torque to be found.",
        "Step 2: Recall the governing equations for torsion. The fundamental relation is $T = GJ \\frac{{d\\theta}}{{dz}}$, where $T$ is torque, $G$ is shear modulus, $J$ is torsion constant, and $\\frac{{d\\theta}}{{dz}}$ is rate of twist. If external loads are given, drawing a Free Body Diagram (FBD) can help visualize applied and reaction torques.",
        "Step 3: Apply the equations of static equilibrium. For a member under torsion, the sum of torques about the longitudinal axis must be zero ($\\sum M_z = 0$). If a distributed torque $T_i(z)$ is present, the differential equilibrium relation $\\frac{{dT}}{{dz}} = -T_i(z)$ applies. If $T_i(z)=0$, then the internal torque $T$ is constant.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the torsion constant $J$ for the given cross-section. For example, for a thin rectangular strip, $J = \\frac{{s t^3}}{{3}}$, where $s$ is length and $t$ is thickness. For other sections (e.g., circular shafts), different formulas for $J$ apply. If deformation (angle of twist or rate of twist $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$) is involved, use the torsion formula $T = GJ \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$.",
        "Step 5: If a distributed torque $T_i(z)$ is applied, integrate the differential relationship $\\frac{dT}{dz} = -T_i(z)$ to find the internal torque $T(z)$ along the beam. Apply boundary conditions and all given data (e.g., rate of twist, shear modulus, geometry) to solve for the unknown torque $M$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute all known numerical values into the derived equations, ensuring consistent units (e.g., N.cm, N.mm, Pa, m, rad). Perform the numerical calculation to find the value of torque 'M'."
