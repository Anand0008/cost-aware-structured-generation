To find its solution, we form the characteristic (or auxiliary) equation by replacing $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ with $m^2$, $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ with $m$, and $y$ with $1$: \n$m^2 + 2m + 1 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:\n$(m+1)^2 = 0$\nThis equation yields a repeated root $m = -1$ with multiplicity 2. For a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, if the auxiliary equation has real and repeated roots $m_1 = m_2 = m$, the general solution is given by:\n$y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{mx}$\nSubstituting $m = -1$ into this general solution, we get:\n$y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{-x}$\nExpanding this, we have:\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 x e^{-x}$\nComparing this form with the given options, Option A, $e^{-x} + xe^{-x}$, matches this general solution form exactly (with $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$).\n\nFor completeness, we can verify by direct substitution for $y = e^{-x} + x e^{-x}$:\n$y' = -e^{-x} + (1 \\cdot e^{-x} + x \\cdot (-e^{-x})) = -e^{-x} + e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = -x e^{-x}$\n$y'' = -(1 \\cdot e^{-x} + x \\cdot (-e^{-x})) = -e^{-x} + x e^{-x} = (x-1)e^{-x}$\nSubstitute $y$, $y'$, and $y''$ into the original ODE:\n$y'' + 2y' + y = (x-1)e^{-x} + 2(-x e^{-x}) + (e^{-x} + x e^{-x})$\n$= x e^{-x} - e^{-x} - 2x e^{-x} + e^{-x} + x e^{-x}$\n$= (x - 1 - 2x + 1 + x)e^{-x} = (2x - 2x)e^{-x} = 0 \\cdot e^{-x} = 0$\nSince the equation holds, Option A is indeed a solution. The other options do not match the general solution form for repeated roots and would not satisfy the ODE."
