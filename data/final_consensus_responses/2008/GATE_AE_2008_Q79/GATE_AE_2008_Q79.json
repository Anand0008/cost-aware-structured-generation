      "reasoning": "For an aircraft in a power-off glide, the maximum range (horizontal distance covered) is achieved when the aircraft operates at its maximum lift-to-drag ratio, denoted as $(L/D)_{max}$. This is a fundamental principle of airplane performance. The relationship between the glide angle ($\\theta$) and the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is given by the formula: $\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{L/D}$. Therefore, the glide angle that results in maximum range, $\\theta_{R_{max}}$, is found by substituting $(L/D)_{max}$ into this formula: $\\tan{\\theta}_{R_{max}} = \\frac{1}{(L/D)_{max}}$. Assuming a typical $(L/D)_{max}$ of 15, the corresponding glide angle $\\theta$ can be calculated as $\\tan^{-1}(1/15) \\approx 3.64$ degrees, which matches option C."
