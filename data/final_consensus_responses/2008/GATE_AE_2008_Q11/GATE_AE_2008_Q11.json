      "reasoning": "An irrotational and inviscid flow can become rotational on passing through a curved shock wave. This phenomenon is explained by Crocco's Theorem. For steady, adiabatic, inviscid flow with no body forces, Crocco's Theorem states that $T \\nabla s - \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla h_0$. Across a shock wave, the stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is conserved, meaning $\\nabla h_0 = 0$ in the direction normal to streamlines. This simplifies the theorem to $T \\nabla s = \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega}$, where $\\vec{\\omega}$ is the vorticity vector ($\\nabla \\times \\vec{V}$). This equation shows that vorticity is generated if and only if there is an entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$) perpendicular to the streamlines. A curved shock wave (such as a detached bow shock) has a varying strength along its surface. This variation causes different streamlines passing through different parts of the shock to experience different increases in entropy. This non-uniform entropy distribution creates an entropy gradient perpendicular to the streamlines, which, according to Crocco's Theorem, generates vorticity, making the flow rotational downstream of the shock. In contrast, a straight normal shock or a straight oblique shock, when uniform, produces a constant entropy jump across the shock front, resulting in a uniform entropy distribution and thus no entropy gradient perpendicular to streamlines ($\\nabla s = 0$). Therefore, the flow can remain irrotational behind such shocks if it was irrotational upstream. A Mach wave is an infinitesimally weak oblique shock and is considered an isentropic process ($\\Delta s \\approx 0$), meaning it does not generate vorticity."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand Initial Conditions and Vorticity Definition. The upstream flow is typically assumed to be irrotational (vorticity $\\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$) and inviscid. Vorticity measures the local rotation of fluid elements.",
        "Step 2: Introduce Crocco's Theorem. Crocco's Theorem is a fundamental relation for steady, inviscid, adiabatic flow, linking entropy gradients, velocity, and vorticity. The general form is $T \\nabla s - \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega} = \\nabla h_0$, where $h_0$ is stagnation enthalpy.",
        "Step 3: Simplify Crocco's Theorem for Shocks. Across a stationary shock wave, the stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ is constant along streamlines, meaning $\\nabla h_0 = 0$ in the cross-stream direction. The theorem simplifies to $T \\nabla s = \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega}$.",
        "Step 4: Identify the Condition for Vorticity Generation. From the simplified Crocco's Theorem, for vorticity ($\\vec{\\omega}$) to become non-zero (i.e., for the flow to become rotational), there must be a non-zero entropy gradient ($\\nabla s$) that is not aligned with the velocity vector (i.e., perpendicular to streamlines). All shock waves cause an increase in entropy ($\\Delta s > 0$). However, it is the *gradient* of entropy across streamlines that generates vorticity.",
        "Step 5: Analyze Normal and Straight Oblique Shock Waves. For a uniform upstream flow, both normal shock waves and straight oblique shock waves produce a uniform increase in entropy across the shock front. This means there is no entropy gradient ($\\nabla s = 0$) perpendicular to the streamlines downstream of these shocks. Consequently, the flow behind normal and straight oblique shocks remains irrotational if the upstream flow was irrotational.",
        "Step 6: Analyze Mach Waves. A Mach wave is an infinitesimally weak disturbance and is considered an isentropic process ($\\Delta s \\approx 0$). Therefore, Mach waves do not generate an entropy gradient or vorticity.",
        "Step 7: Analyze Curved Shock Waves. A curved shock wave (e.g., a bow shock ahead of a blunt body) has varying shock strength along its surface. Streamlines passing through different portions of the curved shock experience different shock strengths and thus different amounts of entropy increase. This variation creates a non-uniform entropy distribution, resulting in an entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$) perpendicular to the streamlines behind the shock.",
        "Step 8: Conclude Rotationality. Applying the simplified Crocco's Theorem ($T \\nabla s = \\vec{V} \\times \\vec{\\omega}$), since a curved shock creates a non-zero entropy gradient ($\\nabla s \\neq 0$) perpendicular to streamlines, the vorticity ($\\vec{\\omega}$) must be non-zero. Therefore, the flow behind a curved shock wave is rotational."
