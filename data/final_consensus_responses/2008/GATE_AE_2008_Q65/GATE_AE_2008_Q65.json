      "reasoning": "The question involves a thin-walled circular tube with a central web dividing it into two symmetric cells, subjected to a torque M. Due to the perfect symmetry of the geometry and loading, the shear flows circulating in each of the two identical cells must be equal in magnitude. The central web is common to both cells. The shear flow from one cell acts in one direction within the web, while the shear flow from the other cell acts in the opposite direction. Since these shear flows are equal and opposite, they cancel each other out in the central web. Therefore, the net shear flow (q) in the central web is zero. This is a fundamental concept in the torsion of symmetric multi-cell thin-walled sections."
