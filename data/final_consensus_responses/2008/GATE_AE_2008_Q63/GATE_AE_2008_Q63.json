The uniform normal stresses \\sigma_1 on the sides of length 'a' and \\sigma_2 on the sides of length 'b' are applied. Force equilibrium in both x and y directions is automatically satisfied due to the opposing nature of the stresses on parallel faces. However, for moment equilibrium about the centroid of the plate, a net moment will exist unless the stresses are equal. Specifically, the net moment is proportional to (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2) and depends on the angle of the parallelogram. For a general parallelogram (where the angle \\theta is not 90 degrees), this moment becomes zero only if \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2. If \\theta were 90 degrees (a rectangle), then any \\sigma_1 and \\sigma_2 would satisfy moment equilibrium, but the problem implies a general parallelogram. Therefore, the condition for equilibrium is \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2.",

Substituting \\sigma_x = \\sigma_y = \\sigma and \\tau_{xy} = 0, we get \\sigma_{x'} = \\frac{\\sigma + \\sigma}{2} + 0 + 0 = \\sigma.
