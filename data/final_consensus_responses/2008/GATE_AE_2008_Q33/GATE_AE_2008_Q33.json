      "reasoning": "The question pertains to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model, specifically the stratosphere. According to the ISA model:\n\n1.  **Temperature in the Stratosphere:** The stratosphere is characterized by an initial isothermal region (from the tropopause at approximately 11 km up to about 20 km) where the temperature remains constant. Above this, in the middle stratosphere (20 km to 32 km), temperature increases with altitude due to ozone absorption. When 'stratosphere' is mentioned in a general context like this question, it often refers to the initial, isothermal part where temperature remains constant.\n\n2.  **Pressure and Density:** Throughout the entire atmosphere, including the stratosphere, both pressure and density decrease exponentially with increasing altitude. This is because there is less air mass above to exert weight, as described by the hydrostatic equation and ideal gas law.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Viscosity:** Dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$) for gases is primarily a function of absolute temperature. For air, it generally increases with temperature. If temperature remains constant (as in the lower stratosphere), dynamic viscosity also remains constant. If temperature increases (as in the middle stratosphere), dynamic viscosity increases.\n\n4.  **Speed of Sound:** The speed of sound ($a$) is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature ($a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$). Therefore, if temperature remains constant, the speed of sound also remains constant. If temperature increases, the speed of sound increases.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. Temperature increases and dynamic viscosity decreases.** Temperature increases in the middle stratosphere, but if temperature increases, dynamic viscosity *increases*, not decreases. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **B. Temperature remains constant and pressure increases.** Temperature remains constant in the lower stratosphere, but pressure *decreases* with altitude, it does not increase. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **C. Temperature decreases and sound speed decreases.** Temperature does not decrease in the stratosphere (it's constant or increases). Consequently, sound speed also does not decrease. So, this is FALSE.\n*   **D. Temperature remains constant and density decreases.** This statement is TRUE for the lower stratosphere. Temperature remains constant, and density always decreases with increasing altitude. This aligns perfectly with the ISA model for the lower stratosphere."
