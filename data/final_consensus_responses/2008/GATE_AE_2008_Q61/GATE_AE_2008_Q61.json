      "reasoning": "An increase in initial propellant temperature with positive temperature sensitivity leads to an increased burn rate. This increased burn rate results in a higher mass flow rate and consequently higher thrust. Simultaneously, a higher burn rate means the propellant is consumed faster, leading to a decreased burn time. Therefore, the physically correct outcome is 'thrust increases but burn time decreases'. However, the provided answer key states 'thrust increases but burn time remains same' (Option D), which contradicts the fundamental inverse relationship between burn rate and burn time for a fixed propellant mass/length. This discrepancy should be noted."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the definition of initial temperature sensitivity of burn rate. A positive sensitivity ($s$ or $\\pi_r$) means that the burn rate ($r$) of the solid propellant increases as its initial temperature ($T_i$) increases. This can be expressed as $s = \\frac{d(\\ln r)}{dT_i} > 0$.",
        "Analyze the effect on burn rate. Given a positive initial temperature sensitivity, an increase in initial temperature ($T_i$) directly leads to an increase in the propellant burn rate ($r$).",
        "Connect burn rate to mass flow rate. The mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) of propellant is directly proportional to the burn rate ($r$), the burning surface area ($A_b$), and the propellant density ($\\rho_p$), i.e., $\\dot{m} = \\rho_p A_b r$. Therefore, an increase in burn rate ($r$) results in an increased mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$).",
        "Determine the effect on thrust. Thrust ($F$) is directly proportional to the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$), often expressed as $F = \\dot{m} I_{sp} g_0$. Consequently, an increased mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) leads to an increase in thrust ($F$).",
        "Determine the effect on burn time. Burn time ($t_b$) is inversely proportional to the burn rate ($r$) for a given propellant web thickness ($L$), i.e., $t_b = L/r$. Alternatively, $t_b \\approx m_p / \\dot{m}$. Since the burn rate ($r$) increases (and thus $\\dot{m}$ increases), the propellant is consumed more quickly, resulting in a decreased burn time ($t_b$).",
        "Conclude the combined effects. With a positive initial temperature sensitivity, an increase in initial temperature leads to an increase in thrust but a decrease in burn time."
