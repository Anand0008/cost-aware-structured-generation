      "reasoning": "The degree of reaction (R) for an impulse turbine is 0. In an impulse turbine, all the expansion occurs in the stator (nozzle), and there is no static enthalpy or pressure drop across the rotor. This means the ratio of the static enthalpy drop in the rotor to the total static enthalpy drop in the stage is 0, which corresponds to the definition of the degree of reaction."

        "The degree of reaction (R) is defined as the ratio of the static enthalpy drop in the rotor to the total static enthalpy drop in the entire stage (stator + rotor). Mathematically, $R = \\frac{\\Delta h_{rotor}}{\\Delta h_{stage}}$ or $R = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$, where h1, h2, h3 are static enthalpies at rotor inlet, rotor outlet, and stage outlet respectively.",
        "Understand the characteristic of an impulse turbine. In an ideal impulse turbine, the entire static enthalpy (or pressure) drop occurs in the stationary nozzle (stator). The rotor blades are designed to change the direction of the high-velocity fluid jets without causing a significant static pressure or enthalpy drop across them. Therefore, the static enthalpy drop in the rotor is zero.",
        "Apply the definition of R to an impulse turbine. Since there is ideally no static enthalpy drop across the rotor in an impulse turbine, the numerator in the degree of reaction formula (static enthalpy drop in rotor) becomes zero. Substituting this into the definition, we get $R = \\frac{\\Delta h_{rotor}}{\\Delta h_{stage}} = \\frac{0}{\\Delta h_{stage}} = 0$.",
