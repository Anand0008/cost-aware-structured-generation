      "reasoning": "The question describes a steady, inviscid flow in a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle with a normal shock in the divergent portion. Upstream of the normal shock, the flow in the divergent section is supersonic. Across the normal shock, the flow abruptly transitions from supersonic to subsonic, with a sudden increase in static pressure, temperature, and density, and a decrease in Mach number and stagnation pressure. Immediately downstream of the normal shock, the flow is subsonic (M < 1). In the divergent portion downstream of the shock, the flow is subsonic and, under the given assumptions (steady, inviscid, and no further shocks), it behaves as a quasi-one-dimensional isentropic flow. For subsonic flow in a diverging duct, an increase in flow area causes the velocity to decrease, and consequently, the static pressure increases. Therefore, from the shock location to the nozzle exit, the static pressure increases smoothly and isentropically towards the static pressure at the nozzle exit. This matches option B."

        "Understand the effect of a normal shock wave: It causes an abrupt transition from supersonic flow (upstream) to subsonic flow (downstream). Across the shock, static pressure increases significantly, Mach number decreases, and stagnation pressure decreases.",
        "Analyze the flow downstream of the shock: The flow is now subsonic and continues through the divergent section of the nozzle. For subsonic flow, a divergent section acts as a diffuser, meaning an increasing area causes the flow to decelerate (velocity decreases) and static pressure to increase.",
        "While the normal shock itself is a non-isentropic process, the flow *after* the shock, assuming no further losses or shocks, can be treated as isentropic. Therefore, the pressure increase in the divergent section downstream of the shock is an isentropic compression.",
