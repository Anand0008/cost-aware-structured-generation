      "reasoning": "When an afterburner is switched on, additional fuel is injected and burned in the exhaust stream downstream of the turbine. This process significantly increases the stagnation temperature of the exhaust gases, leading to a higher exhaust velocity. A higher exhaust velocity directly results in a substantial increase in engine thrust. However, this thrust augmentation comes at a significant cost to fuel efficiency. The afterburner burns fuel at a lower pressure and temperature compared to the main combustor, making the process thermodynamically less efficient. Consequently, a large amount of additional fuel is consumed for the thrust increase, leading to a disproportionately higher increase in the specific fuel consumption (SFC), which is defined as the fuel mass flow rate per unit thrust. Therefore, both thrust and SFC increase."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the function of an afterburner. An afterburner is a secondary combustion chamber downstream of the turbine in a turbojet engine, where additional fuel is injected and burned in the hot, oxygen-rich exhaust gases to significantly increase thrust.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the effect of afterburning on exhaust gas properties. The combustion of additional fuel in the afterburner significantly increases the total temperature (T_t7 or T_t6a) and velocity (V_e) of the exhaust gases before they enter the nozzle.",
        "Step 3: Determine the impact on thrust. This increase in exhaust gas temperature and velocity directly leads to a substantial increase in the engine's thrust (F). Thrust augmentation can be 30-100% depending on the design and operating conditions.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate the effect on fuel consumption. Activating the afterburner requires injecting a large amount of additional fuel, which dramatically increases the total fuel mass flow rate of the engine (ṁ_f_total = ṁ_f_main + ṁ_f_AB).",
        "Step 5: Define Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). SFC is defined as the fuel mass flow rate divided by the thrust (SFC = ṁ_f / F). It is a measure of fuel efficiency (lower is better).",
        "Step 6: Analyze the trade-off and SFC change. Although thrust increases significantly, the fuel consumption increases even more dramatically due to the inefficient burning process in the afterburner (heat addition at lower pressure and temperature, leading to lower thermal efficiency). This results in a substantial increase in SFC.",
        "Step 7: Conclude the combined effect. Therefore, when the afterburner is switched ON, both Thrust (F) and Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) increase."
