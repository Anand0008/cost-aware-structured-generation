      "reasoning": "The problem describes a simply supported beam of length `L` with a concentrated bending moment `M` applied at its mid-span. To determine the shear force diagram (SFD), we first need to calculate the support reactions.\n\nLet the left support be A (pin) and the right support be B (roller). Assume `R_A` and `R_B` are the vertical reactions at A and B, respectively, with upward as positive. The applied moment `M` is clockwise.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium of Vertical Forces:**\n    `$\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B = 0$`\n    Thus, `R_B = -R_A`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium of Moments about A:**\n    Taking counter-clockwise moments as positive:\n    `$\\sum M_A = 0 \\implies -M + R_B \\times L = 0$`\n    (The applied moment `M` is clockwise, hence negative in this convention).\n    `$R_B = \\frac{M}{L}$`\n\n3.  **Calculate R_A:**\n    From `R_A + R_B = 0`:\n    `$R_A = -R_B = -\\frac{M}{L}$`\n    So, `R_A` is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting downwards, and `R_B` is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting upwards.\n\n4.  **Determine Shear Force V(x):**\n    The shear force `V(x)` at any section `x` is the algebraic sum of the vertical forces to the left of that section. We use the standard sign convention where an upward force on the left section results in positive shear.\n\n    *   **For `0 < x < L/2` (left section, before the applied moment):**\n        The only vertical force to the left of the section is `R_A`, which is `$\\frac{M}{L}$` acting downwards.\n        `$V(x) = -R_A = -(-\\frac{M}{L}) = \\frac{M}{L}$` (constant positive shear).\n\n    *   **For `L/2 < x < L` (right section, after the applied moment):**\n        Again, the only vertical force to the left of the section is `R_A` (the concentrated moment `M` does not directly contribute to shear force).\n        `$V(x) = -R_A = -(-\\frac{M}{L}) = \\frac{M}{L}$` (constant positive shear).\n\n    Therefore, the shear force is constant and equal to `$\\frac{M}{L}$` throughout the entire length of the beam. This corresponds to Diagram C in the options, which shows a constant positive shear force of magnitude `$\\frac{M}{L}$`."

Since `dV/dx = -w(x)` and `w(x) = 0` (no distributed load) for this beam, the shear force `V(x)` must be constant. The magnitude of this constant shear is then determined by the support reactions.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Can be faster for experienced users, provides visual intuition for the relationships between load, shear, and moment. Cons: Requires careful handling of concentrated forces and moments as discontinuities or jumps in the diagrams.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for quick sketching and verification, especially when dealing with distributed loads or a combination of loads. For simple cases like this, direct calculation is often just as fast."
