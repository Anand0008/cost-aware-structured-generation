We can use parametric equations:\nx = cos(θ)\ny = sin(θ)\nwhere θ ranges from 0 to 2π.\nThen, dx = -sin(θ) dθ and dy = cos(θ) dθ.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute into velocity components for the unit circle.**\nOn the unit circle (x² + y² = 1):\nu = sin(θ) / (2 * 1) = sin(θ) / 2\nv = -cos(θ) / (2 * 1) = -cos(θ) / 2\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the circulation Γ along the unit circle.**\nThe definition of circulation is Γ = ∮_C (​u dx + v dy).\nΓ = ∫_0^(2π) [ (sin(θ)/2) (-sin(θ) dθ) + (-cos(θ)/2) (cos(θ) dθ) ]\nΓ = ∫_0^(2π) [ (-sin²(θ)/2) - (cos²(θ)/2) ] dθ\nΓ = ∫_0^(2π) [ -1/2 (sin²(θ) + cos²(θ)) ] dθ\nUsing the identity sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1:\nΓ = ∫_0^(2π) (-1/2) dθ\nΓ = [-1/2 * θ]_0^(2π)\nΓ = -1/2 * (2π - 0) = -π\n\n**Step 6: Find the absolute value of circulation.**\nThe question asks for the absolute value of circulation:\n|Γ| = |-π| = π\n\n**Alternative Method (Potential Vortex):**\nThe stream function ψ = (1/4) ln(x² + y²) can be written as ψ = (1/2) ln(√(x² + y²)) = (1/2) ln(r), where r = √(x² + y²).\nFor a potential vortex, the stream function is typically given by ψ = (Γ_vortex / (2π)) ln(r).\nComparing the given stream function with the standard form:\n(Γ_vortex / (2π)) ln(r) = (1/2) ln(r)\nΓ_vortex / (2π) = 1/2\nΓ_vortex = π\n\nThe absolute value of circulation is π.\n\nBoth methods yield the result π, which corresponds to Option D."

Options with π are more plausible than 0 or 1, especially since a singularity is present, making zero unlikely. If time is short, guess π, and remember to take the absolute value if the question asks for it.",
