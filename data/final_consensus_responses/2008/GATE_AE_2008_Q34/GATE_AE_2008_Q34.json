      "reasoning": "The correct answer is B, which states that 'Wing dihedral increases roll stability while a low wing reduces roll stability'. This is consistent with aircraft stability principles. Wing dihedral enhances lateral (roll) stability by creating a restoring rolling moment during sideslip. When an aircraft with dihedral experiences a sideslip, the wing into the wind experiences an increased effective angle of attack, generating more lift, while the other wing experiences a decreased angle of attack and less lift. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment that brings the aircraft back to a level attitude. This effect is quantified by a negative rolling moment coefficient due to sideslip ($C_{l_\\beta} < 0$). Conversely, a low-wing aircraft design generally reduces inherent roll stability compared to a high-wing or mid-wing design, often requiring more dihedral to compensate for this destabilizing effect. A high-wing configuration, for instance, benefits from a pendulum stabilizing effect. Therefore, the statements in option B accurately describe the effects of wing dihedral and wing position on an aircraft's roll stability."

        "Understand the key concepts: roll stability (lateral static stability) is an aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a roll disturbance. Identify the design features affecting it: wing dihedral and wing position.",
        "Understand the mechanism by which wing dihedral enhances lateral stability. When an aircraft experiences a sideslip, the windward wing experiences a higher effective angle of attack, while the leeward wing experiences a reduced effective angle of attack. This differential angle of attack generates differential lift, creating a restoring rolling moment that tends to roll the aircraft back to level flight. Therefore, wing dihedral increases roll (lateral) stability.",
        "Recognize that a low-wing aircraft design generally reduces roll stability compared to a high-wing or mid-wing design. This is because a low-wing configuration places the wing below the aircraft's center of gravity, which can reduce the stabilizing pendulum effect (keel effect) seen in high-wing designs. Additionally, interactions between the wing's downwash and the fuselage can create rolling moments that counteract stability or contribute to instability, making the aircraft more susceptible to rolling motions during sideslip.",
        "Combine the effects: wing dihedral increases roll stability, while a low-wing configuration reduces roll stability. Therefore, the statement that wing dihedral increases roll stability and a low wing reduces roll stability is correct.",
        "Conclude that the statement combining these effects is TRUE."
