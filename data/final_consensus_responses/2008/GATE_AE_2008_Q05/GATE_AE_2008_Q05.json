      "reasoning": "The service ceiling of an aircraft is a standard definition in flight mechanics. It is defined as the altitude at which the maximum rate of climb (R/C) is 100 ft/min for propeller-driven aircraft or general transport aircraft, and 500 ft/min for jet aircraft. For a general transport aircraft, 100 ft/min is the commonly accepted value. To verify option D, we convert 100 ft/min to m/s:\n1 ft = 0.3048 m\n1 min = 60 s\nRate of Climb = 100 ft/min = 100 × (0.3048 m / 60 s) = 30.48 / 60 m/s = 0.508 m/s.\nTherefore, option D, which states 'at which its maximum rate of climb is 0.508 m/s', is the correct definition for the service ceiling. Option C describes the absolute ceiling (where the rate of climb is zero), not the service ceiling. Options A and B are incorrect definitions."

        "This represents a practical operational limit, providing a margin of safety and operational flexibility, unlike the absolute ceiling where the rate of climb is 0 ft/min.",
        "For a general transport aircraft, the 100 ft/min standard is commonly applied.",
