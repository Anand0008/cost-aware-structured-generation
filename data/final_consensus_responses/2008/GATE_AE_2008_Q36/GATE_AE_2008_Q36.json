Speed remains constant**.\n\n2.  **Q. Wing rock:** This is a lateral-directional phenomenon, often observed at high angles of attack, characterized by sustained or limit-cycle **roll oscillations**. This matches Group II, item **3. Roll oscillations**.\n\n3.  **R. Phugoid mode:** This is a long-period longitudinal oscillation where kinetic and potential energy exchange; the **angle of attack remains nearly constant** while speed and altitude vary. This matches Group II, item **2. Angle of attack remains constant**.\n\n4.  **S. Dutch roll:** This is a lateral-directional oscillatory mode involving **coupled roll-yaw oscillations** and sideslip. This matches Group II, item **1. Coupled roll-yaw oscillations**.\n\nTherefore, the correct matching is P-4, Q-3, R-2, S-1, which corresponds to option B."

Quickly identify key characteristics: 'angle of attack constant' → phugoid; 'speed constant' → short period; 'coupled roll-yaw' → Dutch roll; 'roll oscillations' → wing rock. If you know the definitions, it's a quick score; otherwise, eliminate options based on what you do know.",

        "description": "Instead of solely relying on verbal descriptions, visualize the aircraft dynamic modes by plotting the roots (eigenvalues) of the characteristic equation in the complex s-plane. This provides deeper insight into their damping and frequency characteristics (e.g., short period roots are far left and high frequency, phugoid roots are near the imaginary axis and low frequency). Additionally, studying simulated or experimental time histories of aircraft response to disturbances can help identify which variables change significantly in each mode.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Offers a deeper, more intuitive, and quantitative understanding of stability, damping, and oscillation, reducing rote memorization and building strong physical intuition. Cons: More complex, requires additional mathematical background in linear algebra and control theory, and may necessitate access to simulation tools or detailed plots not always available for basic exam preparation.",

This understanding is fundamental for designing flight control systems (e.g., autopilots, Stability Augmentation Systems) to improve stability, modify damping, or adjust frequencies through techniques like pole placement.",
      "Aerodynamics": "The stability derivatives (e.g., $C_{m_\\alpha}$, $C_{n_\\beta}$) that determine the coefficients of the characteristic equation and modal properties are fundamentally derived from aerodynamic forces and moments. Understanding how aerodynamic design choices (e.g., wing sweep, tail size) influence these derivatives is crucial.",

      "Linear Systems Theory": "Aircraft modes are eigenvalues of the linearized equations of motion. The characteristic equation $\\det(sI - A)=0$ is fundamental to determining these modes.",
      "Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations)": "The characteristic equation is derived from linearized differential equations of motion, and its roots are eigenvalues. This directly applies concepts from linear algebra and the solution of ordinary differential equations.",
      "Numerical Methods": "Root-finding algorithms are used to compute eigenvalues of the characteristic equation in practical flight dynamics analysis.",
