In the context of multiple-choice questions testing general properties without specifying initial conditions, $y(0)$ is often assumed to be zero or omitted for simplicity, leading to $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = sY(s)$.\n2.  **Laplace Transform of $t \\cdot y(t)$:** The Laplace transform of a function $y(t)$ multiplied by $t$ is given by the property $L\\{t \\cdot y(t)\\} = -\\frac{d}{ds}Y(s)$.\nOption B correctly states both of these properties: $L\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} = sY(s)$ and $L\\{t y(t)\\} = -\\frac{dY}{ds}$.
