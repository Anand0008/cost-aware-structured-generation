        "Step 2: Assume a separable solution for free vibration: $w(x,t) = \\phi(x) T(t)$. For harmonic motion, $T(t)$ can be represented as $\\sin(\\omega t)$ or $\\cos(\\omega t)$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute $w(x,t)$ into the governing equation and separate the spatial and temporal parts. This yields the spatial eigenvalue problem: $EI \\phi''''(x) - \\rho A \\omega^2 \\phi(x) = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the natural angular frequency.",
        "Step 4: The question provides the fundamental mode shape $\\phi(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. Calculate the first derivative of $\\phi(x)$ with respect to $x$: $\\phi'(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.",

        "Step 10: Set $EI \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 - \\rho A \\omega^2 = 0$ and solve for $\\omega^2$: $\\omega^2 = \\frac{EI}{\\rho A} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^4$.",
