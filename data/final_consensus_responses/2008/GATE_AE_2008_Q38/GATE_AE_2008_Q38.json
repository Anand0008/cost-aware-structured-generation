      "reasoning": "The standard convention for defining aircraft Euler angles (roll φ, pitch θ, and yaw ψ) involves a specific sequence of three successive rotations to transform the inertial (Earth-fixed) frame to the aircraft body frame. This sequence is commonly known as the Z-Y-X sequence, or Yaw-Pitch-Roll. The rotations are performed as follows:\n1.  **First Rotation (Yaw, ψ):** A rotation about the initial (inertial) Z-axis. This sets the heading of the aircraft.\n2.  **Second Rotation (Pitch, θ):** A rotation about the *intermediate* Y-axis (the Y-axis of the frame after the first rotation). This sets the nose-up or nose-down attitude.\n3.  **Third Rotation (Roll, φ):** A rotation about the *final* body X-axis (the X-axis of the frame after the second rotation).\n\nOption A correctly describes this standard sequence: \"first ψ about z axis, second θ about y axis, third φ about x axis\". This Z-Y-X (yaw-pitch-roll) sequence is universally adopted in aerospace engineering."
