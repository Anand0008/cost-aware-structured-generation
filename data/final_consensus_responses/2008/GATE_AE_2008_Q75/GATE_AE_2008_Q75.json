Using the ideal rocket equation (Tsiolkovsky equation) and neglecting gravity/drag, the velocity change is $\\Delta V = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln(m_0/m_b)$. Given initial velocity $V_0 = 2.5 \\, km/s$, burnout velocity $V_b = V_0 + \\Delta V$. Calculation: $\\Delta V = (9.81 \\, m/s^2) * (350 \\, s) * \\ln(10) \\approx 9.81 * 350 * 2.302585 \\approx 7906 \\, m/s \\approx 7.906 \\, km/s$.

        "Step 1: Identify the governing principles and given parameters. The problem asks for the burnout velocity ($V_b$) of a liquid rocket engine, neglecting gravity and drag effects. This requires applying the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation for the velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) and then adding this increment to the initial velocity. Given initial velocity, $V_0 = 2.5 \\, km/s = 2500 \\, m/s$. From the context of a linked question, assume: Specific impulse $I_{sp} = 350 \\, s$, Mass ratio $R = m_0 / m_b = 10$. Standard gravitational acceleration, $g_0 = 9.81 \\, m/s^2$.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the ideal velocity increment ($\\Delta V$) using the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. The formula is $\\Delta V = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln(R)$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the given values into the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. $\\Delta V = (9.81 \\, m/s^2) \\cdot (350 \\, s) \\cdot \\ln(10)$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the natural logarithm and perform the multiplication. $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$. $\\Delta V = 9.81 \\cdot 350 \\cdot 2.302585 \\approx 3433.5 \\cdot 2.302585 \\approx 7906.0 \\, m/s$.",
        "Step 5: Convert the velocity increment to kilometers per second. $\\Delta V = 7906.0 \\, m/s = 7.906 \\, km/s$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the burnout velocity ($V_b$) by adding the initial velocity to the velocity increment. The formula for burnout velocity is $V_b = V_0 + \\Delta V$. $V_b = 2.5 \\, km/s + 7.906 \\, km/s = 10.406 \\, km/s$.",
