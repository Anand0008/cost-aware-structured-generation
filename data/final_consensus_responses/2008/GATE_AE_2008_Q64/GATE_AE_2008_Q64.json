      "reasoning": "The question asks to match the end conditions (Group I) with their corresponding effective length for buckling (Group II). The effective length ($L_e$) of a column, used in Euler's buckling formula, accounts for the influence of its end boundary conditions. It is defined as $L_e = K L$, where $K$ is the effective length factor and $L$ is the actual length of the column. The standard values for $K$ (and thus $L_e$) for different end conditions are:\n\n*   **P. One end built-in and other end free (Cantilever):** This configuration offers the least restraint. The column behaves as if it's twice its actual length. Hence, $K=2.0$, and $L_e = 2.0L$. (Matches Group II: 3)\n*   **Q. Both ends pinned (Hinged-Hinged):** This is the fundamental case, where ends are free to rotate but fixed against translation. Hence, $K=1.0$, and $L_e = 1.0L$. (Matches Group II: 1)\n*   **R. Both ends built-in (Fixed-Fixed):** This configuration offers the most restraint, preventing both rotation and translation at the ends. The column behaves as if it's half its actual length. Hence, $K=0.5$, and $L_e = 0.5L$. (Matches Group II: 4)\n*   **S. One end built-in and other end pinned (Fixed-Hinged):** This configuration offers intermediate restraint. The effective length factor is approximately $K=0.707$ (often rounded to $0.7$). Hence, $L_e = 0.7L$. (Matches Group II: 2)\n\nCombining these matches yields P-3, Q-1, R-4, S-2, which corresponds to Option A."

The effective length ($L_e$) is related to the actual column length ($L$) by the effective length factor ($K$), i.e., $L_e = K L$.",
        "Recall the Euler critical buckling load formula: $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L_e^2}$, where $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $L_e$ is the effective length.",
