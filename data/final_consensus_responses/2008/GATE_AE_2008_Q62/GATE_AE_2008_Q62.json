        "industry_example": "In the SR-71 Blackbird, the intake diffuser had to efficiently slow down supersonic airflow to subsonic speeds for the compressor, with careful management of shock waves to maximize pressure recovery.",
        "why_it_matters": "Poor diffuser efficiency reduces engine thrust and increases fuel consumption, especially at high Mach numbers where even small losses significantly impact performance. Conversely, a small improvement in intake efficiency can lead to significant reductions in specific fuel consumption (SFC) and increases in engine thrust, directly impacting aircraft range, payload capacity, and operating costs. Furthermore, poor efficiency can lead to flow distortion at the compressor face, reducing engine stability and potentially compromising compressor surge margins."

However, be cautious: if your calculation yields a value slightly different from an option, do not guess based solely on proximity, as the correct answer might be further away due to a conceptual error in your calculation.",
      "time_management": "Spend max 3-4 minutes. If the calculation becomes too complex or you are far from the options, quickly recheck your formula and input values. If still stuck, move on and return later."
