      "reasoning": "The question states that the planet is observed to be at its slowest when it is at a distance $r_1$ from the sun and at its fastest when it is at a distance $r_2$ from the sun. According to Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas), a planet moves slowest at its apocenter (farthest point from the central body) and fastest at its pericenter (closest point to the central body). Therefore:\n*   $r_1$ corresponds to the apocenter distance, $r_a$.\n*   $r_2$ corresponds to the pericenter distance, $r_p$.\n\nFrom orbital mechanics, the formulas for apocenter and pericenter distances in an elliptical orbit are:\n*   $r_a = a(1 + e)$\n*   $r_p = a(1 - e)$\n\nWhere $a$ is the semi-major axis and $e$ is the eccentricity.\n\nSubstitute $r_1$ for $r_a$ and $r_2$ for $r_p$:\n*   $r_1 = a(1 + e)$\n*   $r_2 = a(1 - e)$\n\nTo find $e$, we can eliminate $a$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$r_1 - r_2 = a(1 + e) - a(1 - e) = a(1 + e - 1 + e) = 2ae$\nAdding the two equations gives:\n$r_1 + r_2 = a(1 + e) + a(1 - e) = a(1 + e + 1 - e) = 2a$\n\nNow, divide the expression for $(r_1 - r_2)$ by the expression for $(r_1 + r_2)$:\n$e = \\frac{2ae}{2a} = \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{r_1 + r_2}$\n\nThis matches option B."

        "Step 1: Identify Apocenter and Pericenter. Based on Kepler's Second Law, a planet moves slowest at its apocenter (farthest point from the Sun) and fastest at its pericenter (closest point to the Sun). Therefore, r₁ corresponds to the apocenter distance (r_a) and r₂ corresponds to the pericenter distance (r_p).",
        "Step 2: Recall Orbital Distance Formulas. The standard formulas for apocenter and pericenter distances in an elliptical orbit, in terms of the semi-major axis (a) and eccentricity (e), are: r_a = a(1 + e) and r_p = a(1 - e).",
        "Step 3: Derive Eccentricity Formula. Substitute r₁ for r_a and r₂ for r_p into the above equations: r₁ = a(1 + e) and r₂ = a(1 - e). To eliminate 'a' and solve for 'e', subtract the second equation from the first (r₁ - r₂ = 2ae) and add the two equations (r₁ + r₂ = 2a). Dividing the subtracted equation by the added equation yields e = (r₁ - r₂)/(r₁ + r₂).",
        "Step 4: Formulate the sum and difference of the apocenter ($r_a$) and pericenter ($r_p$) distances using their respective formulas: $r_a + r_p = a(1+e) + a(1-e) = 2a$ and $r_a - r_p = a(1+e) - a(1-e) = 2ae$.",
        "Step 5: Divide the expression for the difference by the expression for the sum to eliminate the semi-major axis ($a$): $\\frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p} = \\frac{2ae}{2a}$.",

        "industry_example": "In satellite constellations (e.g., Iridium, Starlink), understanding slight eccentricities is crucial for orbit maintenance, coverage, and communication link budgets. For geostationary satellites, a very low eccentricity (e.g., 0.0001) is maintained for stable, circular orbits. Astronomers also use perihelion/aphelion distances to calculate planetary eccentricities, like Earth's (e ≈ 0.0167).",
        "why_it_matters": "Accurate eccentricity calculations are vital for satellite operations to prevent unexpected altitudes, maintain communication quality, ensure ground station visibility, and aid collision avoidance. In astronomy, it's crucial for predicting seasonal variations, solar flux on spacecraft, planning interplanetary missions, and understanding planetary climate and habitability."

This helps rule out options that yield values greater than 1 or negative eccentricity.",
