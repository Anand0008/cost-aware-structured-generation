      "reasoning": "Laminar flow airfoils are specifically designed to maintain a laminar boundary layer over a larger portion of their surface. A laminar boundary layer is characterized by smooth, orderly flow and exhibits significantly lower viscous shear stresses, and thus lower skin friction drag, compared to a turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, the primary purpose of laminar flow airfoils is to reduce skin friction drag. This is directly supported by the retrieved knowledge, which states that laminar-flow airfoils are designed to maintain a laminar boundary layer to achieve very low drag. Other drag types like trim drag, induced drag, and wave drag are reduced by different design principles (e.g., high aspect ratio for induced drag, sweep for wave drag) and are not the primary target of laminar flow airfoil design."

        "Recall the characteristics of laminar and turbulent boundary layers. A laminar boundary layer is smooth and orderly, while a turbulent boundary layer is chaotic and energetic. Turbulent boundary layers generally have a steeper velocity gradient at the wall, leading to higher shear stress and thus higher skin friction drag compared to laminar boundary layers at the same Reynolds number.",
        "Identify the design principle of 'laminar flow airfoils.' These airfoils are specially shaped to promote and maintain a laminar boundary layer over a significant portion of their chord, thereby delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.",
        "By maintaining a laminar boundary layer over a larger extent, laminar flow airfoils effectively reduce the overall skin friction drag.",
        "While other drag components like pressure drag, induced drag (for finite wings), and wave drag (at high speeds) also exist, laminar flow airfoil design primarily targets the reduction of skin friction drag.",
