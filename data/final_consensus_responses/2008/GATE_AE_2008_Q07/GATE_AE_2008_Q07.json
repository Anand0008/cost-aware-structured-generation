      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the flight condition. In steady, level turning flight, the aircraft maintains constant altitude. This implies that the vertical component of lift balances the aircraft's weight, and a horizontal component of lift provides the necessary centripetal force for the turn.",
        "Step 2: Define Load Factor and relate it to the bank angle. The load factor 'n' is defined as the ratio of total lift (L) to aircraft weight (W), i.e., $n = L/W$. For level flight, if $\\phi$ is the bank angle, the vertical force balance is $L \\cos(\\phi) = W$. Combining these, we get $n = \\frac{L}{W} = \\frac{W/\\cos(\\phi)}{W} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\phi)}$. Therefore, $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{n}$.",
        "Step 3: Formulate the required ratio. The question asks for the ratio of the horizontal component of lift to the aircraft weight. The horizontal component of lift is $L \\sin(\\phi)$. So, the ratio is $\\frac{L \\sin(\\phi)}{W}$. Substitute $L = nW$ (from the definition of load factor) into this ratio: $\\frac{(nW) \\sin(\\phi)}{W} = n \\sin(\\phi)$. Now, use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\phi) = 1$ to express $\\sin(\\phi)$ in terms of 'n'. Since $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{n}$, we have $\\sin(\\phi) = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2(\\phi)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}$. Finally, substitute this back into the ratio: $n \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}\\right) = \\sqrt{n^2 - 1}$.",
        "Step 4: Relate bank angle to load factor. From the vertical force balance $L \\cos(\\phi) = W$ and the load factor definition $L = nW$, substitute $L$ to get $(nW) \\cos(\\phi) = W$. This simplifies to $n \\cos(\\phi) = 1$, or $\\cos(\\phi) = 1/n$.",
        "Step 5: Identify the required ratio and express it in terms of 'n' and '$\\phi$'. The question asks for the ratio of the horizontal component of lift to the aircraft weight, which is $\\frac{L \\sin(\\phi)}{W}$. Using $L = nW$, this ratio becomes $\\frac{nW \\sin(\\phi)}{W} = n \\sin(\\phi)$.",
        "Step 6: Express $\\sin(\\phi)$ in terms of 'n'. Use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\phi) = 1$. Substitute $\\cos(\\phi) = 1/n$ from Step 4: $\\sin^2(\\phi) = 1 - (1/n)^2 = 1 - 1/n^2 = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2}$. Taking the square root, $\\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}$.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the final ratio. Substitute the expression for $\\sin(\\phi)$ from Step 6 into the ratio from Step 5: Ratio $= n \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{n}\\right) = \\sqrt{n^2 - 1}$.",
        "Step 8: Compare with options. The derived ratio $\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}$ matches option C."
