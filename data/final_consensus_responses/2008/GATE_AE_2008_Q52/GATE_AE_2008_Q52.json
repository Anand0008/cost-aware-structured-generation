      "reasoning": "The correct answer is A: rounded leading edge, flat upper surface, and high camber at the rear. Supercritical airfoils are specifically designed for transonic flight. The flat upper surface helps delay the onset of shock waves and drag divergence at high subsonic speeds by reducing local supersonic flow acceleration. The rounded leading edge is a common feature for subsonic airfoils to prevent flow separation and maintain a smoother pressure distribution. The high camber at the rear (aft section) is crucial to recover lift that is lost due to the flattened upper surface and to manage pressure recovery. These features work together to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the airfoil at transonic speeds. Options B, C, and D contain incorrect features such as a sharp leading edge (typical of supersonic airfoils), a generally curved upper surface (characteristic of conventional airfoils), or no camber at the rear, which contradict the design principles of supercritical airfoils."
