This means the function has a minimum value at its vertex and no maximum value. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\nTo determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, we find its first derivative, $f'(x)$.\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 5x + 6) = 2x - 5$.\n\nThe critical point is found by setting $f'(x) = 0$:\n$2x - 5 = 0 \\implies 2x = 5 \\implies x = 2.5$.\n\nThis critical point $x=2.5$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex, where the function changes its behavior.\n\nWe apply the first derivative test:\n- For $x < 2.5$, choose a test value, e.g., $x=2$. $f'(2) = 2(2) - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1 < 0$. So, the function is decreasing on $(-\\infty, 2.5)$.\n- For $x > 2.5$, choose a test value, e.g., $x=3$. $f'(3) = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1 > 0$. So, the function is increasing on $(2.5, \\infty)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nC. is increasing on the interval $(2.0, 2.5)$. This interval is to the left of $x=2.5$, where the function is decreasing. So, option C is incorrect.\nD. is increasing on the interval $(2.5, 3.0)$. This interval is to the right of $x=2.5$, where the function is increasing. So, option D is correct."
