The Breguet range equation for jet aircraft shows that range is proportional to this ratio.

Maximizing this ratio leads to the maximum possible range for the given aircraft and flight conditions. Option A ($C_L/C_D$) is the condition for maximum endurance for a jet, not range."

        "The full Breguet range equation for jet aircraft is $R = 2 \\left( \\frac{C_L^{0.5}}{C_D} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\rho_\\infty S)^{0.5} c_t} \\right) (W_0^{0.5} - W_1^{0.5})$. This equation shows that range is directly proportional to the aerodynamic efficiency term $C_L^{1/2}/C_D$.",
        "To maximize the range $R$, the aerodynamic efficiency term $C_L^{0.5} / C_D$ must be maximized, as it is the key aerodynamic factor influencing range.",
        "The other parameters in the range equation, such as thrust-specific fuel consumption $c_t$, air density $\\rho_\\infty$, wing area $S$, and initial and final weights $W_0$ and $W_1$, are either fixed or can be optimized separately, making $C_L^{0.5} / C_D$ the primary aerodynamic term for range maximization.",
