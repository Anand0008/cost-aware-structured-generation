      "reasoning": "For an ideal ramjet with matched pressures ($p_e = p_a$) and negligible fuel-air ratio ($f \\ll 1$), the thrust per unit mass flow rate is given by $F/\\dot{m} = V_e - V_0$. The flight velocity is $V_0 = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$. For an ideal ramjet, the exit Mach number equals the flight Mach number ($M_e = M$). Using the relation $V = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, the exhaust velocity is $V_e = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$. Substituting these into the thrust equation gives $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} - M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$. Factoring out common terms, we get $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{T_a}} - 1 \\right)$. This matches option C."

        "Step 2: Express velocities in terms of Mach number ($M$), specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), gas constant ($R$), and static temperature ($T$) using the relation $V = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$. Thus, $V_0 = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$ and $V_e = M_e \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$.",
        "Step 3: For an ideal ramjet with isentropic diffuser and nozzle, and constant $\\gamma, R$, the exit Mach number equals the flight Mach number ($M_e = M_0 = M$). This is a key ideal ramjet assumption.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the expressions for $V_e$ and $V_0$ into the thrust equation from Step 1, using the ideal ramjet assumption from Step 3: $F/\\dot{m} = M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} - M \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_a}$.",

Understanding compressible flow behavior and Mach number effects is crucial for analyzing ramjet performance, including the condition $M_e = M_a$ for a perfectly expanded ideal ramjet nozzle.",
      "Thermodynamics": "The ideal ramjet analysis relies on principles from thermodynamics, such as the Brayton cycle, isentropic flow relations, and the First Law of Thermodynamics for heat addition. Fundamental thermodynamic properties like specific heat ratio $\\gamma$, gas constant $R$, and perfect-gas relations are essential, linking temperature, enthalpy, and speed of sound."
