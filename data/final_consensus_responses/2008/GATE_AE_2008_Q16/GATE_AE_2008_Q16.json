      "reasoning": "Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine, indicating how much thrust is generated per unit of propellant mass flow rate. A higher $I_{sp}$ means more efficient use of propellant. The general trend for common rocket propellants is that high-energy liquid propellants, especially those involving hydrogen, offer the highest $I_{sp}$, followed by hydrocarbon-based liquid propellants, and then solid propellants.\n\n1.  **Double Base (DB) Solid Propellant:** Solid propellants generally have the lowest specific impulse among the options due to their inherent chemical composition, lower combustion temperatures, and higher molecular weight of exhaust products compared to liquid propellants. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for solid propellants is in the range of 240-290 s.\n\n2.  **LOX-RP1 (Liquid Oxygen - Kerosene):** This is a widely used liquid bipropellant combination. Kerosene (RP-1) is a hydrocarbon fuel. While offering good density and storability, its combustion products (like $\\text{CO}_2$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{CO}$) have a higher average molecular weight compared to hydrogen-based propellants. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for LOX-RP1 is in the range of 330-360 s.\n\n3.  **LOX-LH$_2$ (Liquid Oxygen - Liquid Hydrogen):** This combination is known for providing the highest specific impulse among practical chemical propellants. Liquid hydrogen is the lightest element, and its combustion with oxygen produces water vapor ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) and sometimes unreacted $\\text{H}_2$ as exhaust products, which have a very low average molecular weight. This low molecular weight, combined with high combustion temperatures, results in very high exhaust velocities and thus high $I_{sp}$. Typical vacuum $I_{sp}$ for LOX-LH$_2$ is in the range of 430-460 s.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of increasing specific impulse is DB < LOX-RP1 < LOX-LH$_2$."

        "Recall the general performance characteristics and typical Isp ranges for each propellant type. Solid propellants (DB) generally have the lowest Isp (e.g., ~250-300 s). Liquid propellants offer higher Isp.",

        "The high Isp of LOX-LH₂ is due to liquid hydrogen being the lightest element, producing exhaust products (primarily H₂O, H₂) with a very low average molecular weight.
