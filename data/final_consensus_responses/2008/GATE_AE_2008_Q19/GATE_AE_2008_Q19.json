      "reasoning": "The compatibility conditions in the theory of elasticity are a set of mathematical relationships that the strain components must satisfy. Their fundamental purpose is to ensure that the calculated strain field corresponds to a physically possible deformation, meaning the displacements within a deformed body are single-valued and continuous. This prevents the formation of internal voids, overlaps, tearing, or discontinuities in the material. These conditions are derived by ensuring that the strain-displacement relations can be integrated to obtain a unique and continuous displacement field. Option A is incorrect as compatibility is about strains and displacements, not direct compatibility between various stresses. Option B describes constitutive relations (stress-strain laws), which are distinct from compatibility conditions. Option D refers to the bi-harmonic equation, which arises when compatibility and equilibrium equations are combined and expressed in terms of a stress function (like Airy's stress function) for 2D problems, but it is a consequence, not the primary purpose, of compatibility conditions."
