      "reasoning": "For a convergent nozzle with choked flow at the exit, the Mach number at the exit ($M_e$) is 1. The specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is related to the effective exhaust velocity ($V_e$) by $I_{sp} = V_e / g_0$. Since the options are in units of velocity, we need to find $V_e$.\n\nFor isentropic flow, the static temperature at the exit ($T_e$) is related to the chamber stagnation temperature ($T_c$) by:\n$T_e = T_c \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2}\\right)$\nSince $M_e = 1$ for choked flow, this simplifies to:\n$T_e = T_c \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}}\\right) = T_c \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{2 + \\gamma-1}{2}}\\right) = T_c \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)$\n\nFor choked flow, the exhaust velocity ($V_e$) at the exit is equal to the speed of sound ($a_e$) at the exit conditions:\n$V_e = a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e}$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $T_e$ into the $V_e$ equation:\n$V_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R \\left(T_c \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)}$\n$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma R T_c}{\\gamma+1}}$\n\nThis expression matches option D. The condition \"nozzle exhaust static pressure is equal to ambient static pressure\" implies that the nozzle is perfectly expanded, which is consistent with the exit pressure being the critical pressure for choked flow if ambient pressure equals critical pressure."

        "Step 1: Identify that the flow is choked at the nozzle exit. For choked flow in a convergent nozzle, the Mach number at exit M_e = 1. The nozzle exhaust static pressure is equal to the ambient static pressure (p_e = p_a).",
        "Step 2: Since the nozzle exhaust static pressure equals ambient pressure (p_e = p_a), the thrust equation simplifies, and specific impulse I_sp = V_e / g0, where V_e is the exhaust velocity. The options provided are velocity expressions, so the goal is to find V_e.",
        "Step 3: For isentropic flow, the stagnation temperature T_c is related to static temperature at exit T_e by the relation: T_c = T_e * (1 + ((γ-1)/2) * M_e^2). With M_e = 1 (choked flow), this simplifies to T_e = T_c / (1 + (γ-1)/2) = (2T_c)/(γ+1).",
        "Step 4: The exhaust velocity for choked flow (M_e = 1) is equal to the speed of sound at the exit, which is given by V_e = sqrt(γ R T_e).",
        "Step 5: Substitute the expression for T_e from Step 3 into the exhaust velocity equation from Step 4: V_e = sqrt(γ R * (2T_c)/(γ+1)) = sqrt( (2γ R T_c) / (γ+1) ).",
        "Step 6: This derived expression for V_e matches the form of the given options. If specific impulse in seconds were required, this velocity would be divided by g0, but the options are velocity expressions."

      "triage_tip": "This is a standard derivation. Look for keywords: 'only a convergent nozzle', 'choked', 'T_c', 'R', 'gamma'. Immediately set M = 1, write $T_e/T_c = 2/(\\gamma+1)$, plug into $V_e = \\sqrt{2 c_p (T_c - T_e)}$, and simplify. If you remember the choked flow temperature relation, you can solve in 2 minutes. Otherwise, eliminate options: options with $(\\gamma-1)$ in the denominator correspond to full expansion to vacuum (V_max), so they are likely not correct for a convergent nozzle.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "Since the flow is choked and not fully expanded, the velocity should be less than V_max. V_max has (γ-1) in denominator. Options with (γ+1) are smaller. Between C and D, D has factor 2, which is typical for choked sonic velocity expression. Guess D.",
