      "reasoning": "The escape velocity ($v_e$) from a celestial body is derived from the principle of conservation of energy, equating the initial kinetic energy to the work required to overcome gravity from the initial position to infinity. The formula for escape velocity is $v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{R}}$, where $\\mu$ is the gravitational parameter of the central body (Earth in this case, $\\mu = G M_{Earth}$) and $R$ is the distance from the center of the central body to the spacecraft. This formula clearly shows that escape velocity depends on the gravitational parameter of the Earth (which includes Earth's mass) and the distance from Earth's center to the spacecraft. It does NOT depend on the mass of the spacecraft, as the spacecraft's mass cancels out during the derivation. Earth's rotational speed and orbital speed are not direct factors in the fundamental definition of escape velocity."

        "Step 1: Define escape velocity as the minimum speed required for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of a celestial body and escape its influence.",
        "Step 2: Recall that the escape velocity formula is derived using the principle of conservation of energy, equating the initial kinetic energy to the work done against gravity to reach infinity.",
        "Step 3: State the formula for escape velocity: $v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{R}}$, where $\\mu = G M_e$ is the gravitational parameter of the Earth ($G$ is the gravitational constant and $M_e$ is the mass of the Earth), and $R$ is the distance from the center of the Earth.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the variables in the formula. The escape velocity depends on the gravitational parameter of the central body (Earth's mass) and the distance $R$ from its center. Crucially, the mass of the spacecraft cancels out during the derivation, meaning escape velocity is independent of the spacecraft's mass.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate the options. The escape velocity formula clearly shows dependence on the distance between Earth's center and the spacecraft ($R$). It does not depend on the mass of the spacecraft (as it cancels out). Earth's rotational speed and orbital speed are not direct factors in the escape velocity formula, although Earth's rotation can be utilized for launch assistance.",
        "Step 6: Conclude that the distance between the spacecraft and the center of the Earth is the primary factor determining the escape velocity for a given celestial body."
