      "reasoning": "The symmetry of the stress tensor (e.g., $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$) is a fundamental result in continuum mechanics, directly derived from the principle of moment equilibrium (or balance of angular momentum) applied to an infinitesimal element. For rotational equilibrium, the sum of moments about any axis must be zero, which necessitates the equality of complementary shear stresses. Force equilibrium (balance of linear momentum) leads to the differential equations of equilibrium but does not impose stress tensor symmetry. Linear stress-strain relations (constitutive laws) and compatibility conditions (kinematic relations) are separate principles and do not derive stress tensor symmetry."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "The question asks for the fundamental condition from which the symmetry of the stress tensor is derived. This symmetry implies that complementary shear stresses are equal (e.g., $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$).",
        "To understand this, consider an infinitesimal cubical element within a deformable body. For this element to be in complete static equilibrium, both linear momentum (force) and angular momentum (moment) balances must be satisfied.",
        "Force equilibrium (balance of linear momentum) leads to the differential equations of equilibrium, which relate stress gradients to body forces. However, these equations alone do not inherently require the equality of complementary shear stresses.",
        "Now, apply the balance of angular momentum (moment equilibrium). Taking moments about the center of the infinitesimal cube, the moments are primarily generated by the shear stresses acting on the faces. Body forces and inertial terms contribute moments of higher order that vanish as the element size approaches zero, especially in the absence of body moments.",
        "For example, considering moments about the z-axis, the shear stresses $\\tau_{xy}$ and $\\tau_{yx}$ on opposing faces create opposing moments. For the net moment to be zero, these moments must balance, which directly implies that the magnitudes of these complementary shear stresses must be equal: $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx}$. This derivation extends to other axes, yielding $\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{zx}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = \\tau_{zy}$.",
        "Therefore, the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor (i.e., $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$) is a direct consequence of satisfying the moment equilibrium conditions for an infinitesimal element, assuming no body moments or couple stresses. This symmetry reduces the number of independent stress components from 9 to 6."
