Using the formula for principal stresses in a 2D plane stress state:\n\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$\n\nSubstitute the inferred values:\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{9c + (-c)}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{9c - (-c)}{2}\\right)^2 + (12c)^2}$\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{8c}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{10c}{2}\\right)^2 + (12c)^2}$\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = 4c \\pm \\sqrt{(5c)^2 + (12c)^2}$\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = 4c \\pm \\sqrt{25c^2 + 144c^2}$\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = 4c \\pm \\sqrt{169c^2}$\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = 4c \\pm 13c$\n\nTherefore, the two principal stresses are:\n$\\sigma_1 = 4c + 13c = 17c \\text{ MPa}$\n$\\sigma_2 = 4c - 13c = -9c \\text{ MPa}$\n\nThis matches option A."
