      "reasoning": "The problem asks to find the logarithmic decrement (δ) given the quality factor (Q) for a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with viscous damping. This requires two main steps: first, relating the quality factor (Q) to the damping ratio (ζ), and then relating the damping ratio (ζ) to the logarithmic decrement (δ).\n\n1.  **Calculate Damping Ratio (ζ) from Quality Factor (Q):**\n    The relationship between the quality factor Q and the damping ratio ζ for an SDOF system is:\n    `Q = 1 / (2ζ)`\n    Given Q = 10, we can solve for ζ:\n    `10 = 1 / (2ζ)`\n    `ζ = 1 / (2 * 10) = 1 / 20 = 0.05`\n\n2.  **Calculate Logarithmic Decrement (δ) from Damping Ratio (ζ):**\n    The exact relationship between the logarithmic decrement δ and the damping ratio ζ is:\n    `δ = (2πζ) / √(1 - ζ²)`\n    Substitute the calculated value of ζ = 0.05:\n    `δ = (2π * 0.05) / √(1 - (0.05)²) `\n    `δ = (0.1π) / √(1 - 0.0025)`\n    `δ = (0.1π) / √(0.9975)`\n\n3.  **Approximation for Small Damping:**\n    Since ζ = 0.05 is a small value (much less than 1), the term √(1 - ζ²) is approximately equal to 1. Specifically, `√(1 - 0.0025) ≈ 0.9987`. For small damping ratios, the logarithmic decrement can be approximated as:\n    `δ ≈ 2πζ`\n    `δ ≈ 2π * 0.05`\n    `δ ≈ 0.1π`\n    `δ ≈ π / 10`\n\n    Using the full formula, `δ = (0.1π) / 0.9987 ≈ 0.10013π`, which is very close to `0.1π`. For GATE problems, this approximation is generally accepted for small damping ratios.\n\nTherefore, the logarithmic decrement is `π / 10`."
