The coefficients of $y$ and its derivatives can be constants or functions of the independent variable ($x$), but not functions of the dependent variable ($y$).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. $\\frac{{d^2y}}{{dx^2}} + \\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + 2y^2 = 0$**\n    This equation is **nonlinear** because of the $y^2$ term.

All terms involving $y$ and its derivatives ($y$, $dy/dx$, $d^2y/dx^2$) appear only to the first power. There are no products of $y$ or its derivatives. The coefficient $x$ for the $dy/dx$ term is a function of the independent variable $x$, which is permissible for a linear ODE. This matches the general form $a_n(x) y^{(n)} + ... + a_0(x) y = f(x)$.\n\n*   **D. $\\left(\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}}\\right)^2 + \\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + 2y = 0$**\n    This equation is **nonlinear** because of the $\\left(\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}}\\right)^2$ term.
