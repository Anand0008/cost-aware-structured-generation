      "reasoning": "The pressure coefficient $C_p$ for incompressible, inviscid flow is defined as $C_p = \\frac{p - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2}$. Alternatively, it can be expressed using local and freestream velocities as $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2$. To find the maximum possible value of $C_p$, the term $\\left(\\frac{V}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2$ must be minimized. Since velocity $V$ cannot be negative, its minimum possible value is $0$. This condition occurs at a stagnation point, where the fluid comes to a complete stop relative to the body ($V=0$). Substituting $V=0$ into the formula $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2$ yields $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0}{V_\\infty}\\right)^2 = 1 - 0 = 1$. Alternatively, using Bernoulli's equation between a freestream point and a stagnation point ($V=0$), we have $p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2 = p_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (0)^2$, which simplifies to $p_0 = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2$. Substituting $p_0$ for $p$ in the definition $C_p = \\frac{p - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2}$ gives $C_p = \\frac{(p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2) - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_\\infty^2} = 1$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $C_p$ in incompressible flow is 1, which occurs at a stagnation point. This represents the complete conversion of dynamic pressure to static pressure."
