      "reasoning": "An oblique shock diffuser is preferred over a normal shock diffuser because it significantly reduces the total pressure loss. A single strong normal shock causes the maximum possible total pressure loss for a given Mach number reduction. In contrast, an oblique shock diffuser is designed to decelerate the flow through a series of weaker oblique shocks, followed by a final weak normal shock. This process results in much higher stagnation pressure recovery, which translates directly to lower operating costs and reduced reservoir pressure requirements for the wind tunnel."

        "Compare normal and oblique shock characteristics: A single strong normal shock, for a given upstream Mach number, is the strongest possible shock and results in the largest possible total pressure loss. Oblique shocks, however, are weaker and incur less total pressure loss.",
        "Explain the mechanism of an oblique shock diffuser: An oblique shock diffuser is designed to replace a single strong normal shock with a series of weaker oblique shocks, followed by a final relatively weak normal shock. This staged deceleration minimizes the overall total pressure loss.",
        "Conclude the advantages for wind tunnel operation: The significantly reduced total pressure loss achieved by using an oblique shock diffuser allows the wind tunnel to operate at a much lower upstream reservoir pressure. This makes the overall system more efficient and economical to run, requiring less power."
