      "reasoning": "Simpson's 1/3 rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to three. The integrand $f(x) = x^3$ is a cubic polynomial. This means its fourth derivative, $f^{(4)}(x)$, is identically zero. Consequently, the error term for Simpson's 1/3 rule, which depends on the fourth derivative, becomes zero. Therefore, the numerical estimate by Simpson's rule will be exactly equal to the true integral value, resulting in 0% error."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the integral and calculate its exact value. The integral is $\\int_0^1 x^3 dx$. Using the power rule for integration, $\\int_0^1 x^3 dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1^4}{4} - \\frac{0^4}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.",
        "Step 2: Recall Simpson's 1/3 rule formula for a single application over the interval $[x_0, x_2]$ with $h = (x_2 - x_0)/2$. The formula is: $\\int_{x_0}^{x_2} f(x)dx \\approx \\frac{h}{3} [f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + f(x_2)]$.",
        "Step 3: Apply Simpson's 1/3 rule to $f(x)=x^3$ over $[0, 1]$. Here, $x_0=0, x_1=0.5, x_2=1$, and $h=0.5$. Calculate the function values: $f(0)=0^3=0$, $f(0.5)=(0.5)^3=0.125$, $f(1)=1^3=1$. Substitute these into the formula: Simpson's estimate = $\\frac{0.5}{3} [f(0) + 4f(0.5) + f(1)] = \\frac{0.5}{3} [0 + 4(0.125) + 1] = \\frac{0.5}{3} [0 + 0.5 + 1] = \\frac{0.5}{3} \\times 1.5 = \\frac{0.75}{3} = 0.25$.",
        "Step 4: Compare the Simpson's estimate with the exact value. Exact value = 0.25, Simpson's estimate = 0.25. The absolute error is $|0.25 - 0.25| = 0$. This implies the numerical approximation is exact.",
        "Step 5: Recall the error formula for Simpson's 1/3 rule: $E_{Simpson} = -\\frac{h^{5}}{90}f^{(4)}(\\zeta)$. For $f(x) = x^3$, the derivatives are $f'(x)=3x^2$, $f''(x)=6x$, $f'''(x)=6$, and $f^{(4)}(x)=0$. Since the fourth derivative is zero, the error term $E_{Simpson}$ is also zero, confirming the exactness of the approximation.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the percentage error. Percentage Error = $\\frac{|\\text{Exact} - \\text{Approximation}|}{|\\text{Exact}|} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{|0.25 - 0.25|}{|0.25|} \\times 100\\% = 0\\%$."
