      "reasoning": "For steady, unaccelerated level flight, the thrust required ($T_R$) is equal to the drag ($D$), and the lift ($L$) is equal to the aircraft's weight ($W$). The thrust required can be expressed as $T_R = D = W / (L/D)$. To minimize $T_R$ for a given weight $W$, the aircraft must operate at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D_{max}$). The drag polar for a typical subsonic aircraft is given by $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$, where $C_{D0}$ is the zero-lift drag coefficient and $K$ is the induced drag factor. To find the lift coefficient ($C_L$) at which $L/D$ is maximum, we differentiate $L/D = C_L / (C_{D0} + K C_L^2)$ with respect to $C_L$ and set it to zero. This derivation yields the condition $C_{D0} = K C_L^2$, or $C_L = \\sqrt{C_{D0} / K}$. This is also the condition where parasite drag equals induced drag. For typical conventional subsonic aircraft, common values for $C_{D0}$ and $K$ (e.g., $C_{D0} \\approx 0.025$ and $K \\approx 0.05$, or $C_{D0}=0.02$ and $K=0.04$) lead to $C_L = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$. This value rounds to 0.70, which is option B. The question being of type MCQ_LINKED suggests that this specific value of 0.70 might have been derived or provided in a preceding part of a linked question set."

Minimum thrust required occurs when drag is minimized for a given lift, which corresponds to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D = C_L/C_D).",
        "Assume a parabolic drag polar: C_D = C_D0 + K C_L^2, where C_D0 is the zero-lift drag coefficient and K is the induced drag factor. To minimize T_R (for a given W), the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) must be maximized.",
