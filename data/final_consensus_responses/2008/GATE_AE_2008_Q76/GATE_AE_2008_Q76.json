This numerical integration technique approximates the integral of a function over an interval by fitting a quadratic polynomial. For a single application over the interval $[a, b]$, with midpoint $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ and step size $h = \\frac{b-a}{2}$, the formula is given by $I \\approx \\frac{h}{3} (f(a) + 4f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + f(b))$. Substituting $h = \\frac{b-a}{2}$ yields $I \\approx \\frac{b-a}{6} (f(a) + 4f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + f(b))$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{b-a}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}f(a) + \\frac{4}{3}f(\\frac{a+b}{2}) + \\frac{1}{3}f(b) \\right)$, which precisely matches Option C. This formula is derived from approximating the integrand with a second-order Newton's forward difference interpolating polynomial.
