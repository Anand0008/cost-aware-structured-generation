This is a fundamental principle in potential flow theory and is required to obtain a unique and physically realistic solution for the circulation and lift around the airfoil. The vortex sheet strength $\\gamma$ is defined as the difference in tangential velocities across the sheet ($\\gamma = u_1 - u_2$), so a smooth flow condition at the trailing edge requires this difference to be zero."
