Check for Differentiability at $x=0$:**\nA function $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$ if the derivative $f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$ exists. For this limit to exist, the left-hand derivative (LHD) and right-hand derivative (RHD) must be equal.\n\n*   **Left-hand derivative (LHD) at $x=0$:**\n    $f'(0^-) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\sin h - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\sin h}{h}$\n    Using the standard limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$, we get $f'(0^-) = 1$.\n\n*   **Right-hand derivative (RHD) at $x=0$:**\n    $f'(0^+) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{3(0+h)^3 - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{3h^3}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} 3h^2$\n    Substituting $h=0$, we get $f'(0^+) = 3(0)^2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f'(0^-) = 1$ and $f'(0^+) = 0$, the left-hand derivative is not equal to the right-hand derivative ($1 \\neq 0$).
