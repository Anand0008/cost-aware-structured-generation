      "reasoning": "The problem is a linked question, likely from GATE AE 2008 Q72, which provides context and parameters for a pressure vessel subjected to internal pressure and an additional torque. The goal is to find the maximum value of 'c' (representing a shear stress component) for safe loading based on the Von Mises failure criterion.\n\n**General Solution Method:**\n1.  **Determine the stress state:** Calculate the normal stresses (hoop and longitudinal for a pressure vessel, or bending stress for a shaft) and shear stresses (due to torque) at the critical point. This results in a plane stress state (σx, σy, τxy).\n2.  **Calculate Von Mises equivalent stress (σv):** Apply the Von Mises criterion for a plane stress state: \n    σv = sqrt( σx^2 - σx σy + σy^2 + 3 τxy^2 )\n3.  **Apply the failure criterion:** For safe loading, the Von Mises equivalent stress must be less than or equal to the material's yield strength (σy), potentially divided by a factor of safety (N): \n    σv ≤ σy / N\n4.  **Solve for 'c':** Substitute the expressions for stress components (which will include 'c') into the Von Mises equation and solve the resulting inequality for the maximum value of 'c'.\n\n**Specific Context (from GATE AE 2008 Q72, as identified by Gemini):**\n-   Radius (R) = 100 mm\n-   Wall thickness (t) = 2 mm\n-   Internal pressure (p) = 2 MPa\n-   Material yield strength (σy) = 200 MPa\n-   Maximum shear stress (τxy) = 'c' (due to torque)\n\n1.  **Normal stresses due to internal pressure:**\n    Hoop stress (σh) = pR/t = (2 MPa * 100 mm) / 2 mm = 100 MPa\n    Longitudinal stress (σl) = pR/(2t) = (2 MPa * 100 mm) / (2 * 2 mm) = 50 MPa\n    So, σx = 50 MPa, σy = 100 MPa, τxy = c.\n\n2.  **Von Mises equivalent stress:**\n    σv^2 = σx^2 - σx σy + σy^2 + 3 τxy^2\n    σv^2 = (50)^2 - (50)(100) + (100)^2 + 3 c^2\n    σv^2 = 2500 - 5000 + 10000 + 3 c^2\n    σv^2 = 7500 + 3 c^2\n\n3.  **Solve for 'c' for safe loading:**\n    If we assume σv = σy = 200 MPa (no factor of safety):\n    200^2 = 7500 + 3 c^2\n    40000 = 7500 + 3 c^2\n    3 c^2 = 32500\n    c^2 = 10833.33\n    c ≈ 104.08 MPa\n\n    This value does not match the given options. The correct answer is B (15.3). Working backward with c = 15.3 MPa:\n    σv^2 = 7500 + 3(15.3)^2\n    σv^2 = 7500 + 3(234.09)\n    σv^2 = 7500 + 702.27\n    σv^2 = 8202.27\n    σv ≈ 90.56 MPa\n\n    This implies that for the answer 15.3 to be correct, an implicit factor of safety N = σy / σv = 200 / 90.56 ≈ 2.208 is being used, or the problem statement has a different interpretation or additional constraints not fully captured. However, the procedure of applying the von-Mises criterion to a combined stress state and solving for 'c' is correct."
