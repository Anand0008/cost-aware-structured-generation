      "reasoning": "The behavior of an attached oblique shock wave is governed by the $\\theta-\\beta-M$ relationship, where $\\theta$ is the flow deflection angle (fixed by the body geometry), $\\beta$ is the shock wave angle, and $M_{\\infty}$ is the upstream Mach number. For a fixed flow deflection angle $\\theta$, an increase in the free stream Mach number $M_{\\infty}$ causes the shock wave angle $\\beta$ to decrease. A smaller shock angle $\\beta$ means the shock wave is less inclined with respect to the incoming flow direction, making it 'flatter' and thus moving it closer to the body surface. This is a fundamental characteristic of oblique shocks, often visualized using $\\theta-\\beta-M$ diagrams or shock polars. The shock does not detach (which occurs for too low $M_{\\infty}$ or too large $\\theta$) nor does it become a normal shock. Therefore, option A is correct."

        "For a fixed flow deflection angle $\\theta$, an increase in the upstream Mach number ($M_{\\infty}$ or $M_1$) results in a decrease in the shock wave angle $\\beta$, as dictated by the `$\\theta-\\beta-M$` relationship.",
        "Interpret this physical meaning: a smaller shock angle $\\beta$ means the shock wave becomes more aligned with the free stream direction, causing it to move closer to the body surface.",
        "Evaluate the options. Option A, \"move closer to the body,\" is consistent with the decrease in $\\beta$. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: moving away is the opposite effect; detachment occurs when $\\theta$ exceeds $\\theta_{max}$ or $M_{\\infty}$ decreases, not increases; and becoming a normal shock ($\\beta = 90^{\\circ}$) is not the behavior for increasing $M_{\\infty}$ at fixed $\\theta > 0$."

        "description": "Instead of using the implicit θ-β-M relation, one can use a graphical θ-β-M diagram. For a fixed θ (deflection angle), trace a horizontal line and observe how the corresponding β (shock angle) changes as the Mach number (M∞, represented by parameterized curves) increases. This visually demonstrates that β decreases with increasing M∞.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides a visual and intuitive understanding, reinforces memory, and offers visual confirmation. Less prone to memory errors if the diagram's shape is understood. Cons: Requires access to pre-computed charts, familiarity with the diagram's structure and interpretation, and is not practical in closed-book exams.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for verifying a recalled answer, when the exact trend is momentarily forgotten, or during study sessions to build intuition and gain deeper conceptual insight into shock behavior and the existence of weak/strong solutions."
