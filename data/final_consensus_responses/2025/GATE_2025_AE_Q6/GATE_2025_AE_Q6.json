Let's analyze each pair:\n\n*   **P. \"This house is in a mess.\"** - This is a statement about a messy environment. The most appropriate response is an offer to help clean or organize. **3. \"No problem, let me clear it up for you.\"** fits perfectly.\n*   **Q. \"I am not happy with the marks given to me.\"** - This is an expression of dissatisfaction with an academic outcome. A supportive response would be an offer to help address the issue with the relevant authority. **4. \"Don’t worry, I will take it up with your teacher.\"** is the most suitable response.\n*   **R. \"Politics is a subject I avoid talking about.\"** - This is a clear statement of personal preference and a boundary. The appropriate response is to acknowledge and respect that boundary. **1. \"Alright, I won’t bring it up during our conversations.\"** is the correct match.\n*   **S. \"I don’t know what this word means.\"** - This is a request for clarification on vocabulary. A common and practical response is to suggest looking it up. **2. \"Well, you can easily look it up.\"** is the most direct and helpful suggestion.\n\nCombining these matches, we get: P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2. This corresponds exactly to Option B."
