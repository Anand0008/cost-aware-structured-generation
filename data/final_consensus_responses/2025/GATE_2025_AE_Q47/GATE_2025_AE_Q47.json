      "reasoning": "The problem states two rectangular wings tested at the same Reynolds number. For the first wing, chord c1 = 1.2 m, aspect ratio AR1 = 5, so span b = AR1 * c1 = 6 m. For the second wing, same span b = 6 m, AR2 = 6, so chord c2 = b / AR2 = 1.0 m. Matching Reynolds numbers (Re = \\rho V c / \\mu) with identical \\rho and \\mu gives V1 * c1 = V2 * c2. Thus V2 = V1 * (c1 / c2) = 60 * (1.2 / 1.0) = 72 m/s. This matches the provided answer key (72)."

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters for the first wing (Wing 1): chord length $c_1 = 1.2$ m, aspect ratio $AR_1 = 5$, airspeed $V_1 = 60$ m/s. The fluid properties are air density $\\rho = 1.3$ kg/m$^3$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ kg/m-s. For the second wing (Wing 2), the aspect ratio $AR_2 = 6$ and it has the same span as the first wing.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the span ($b$) of the first wing using the aspect ratio formula $AR = \\frac{b}{c}$. So, $b = AR_1 \\times c_1 = 5 \\times 1.2 \\text{ m} = 6.0 \\text{ m}$. Since the second wing has the same span, $b_2 = b_1 = 6.0 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the chord length ($c_2$) of the second wing using its aspect ratio and the common span: $c_2 = \\frac{b_2}{AR_2} = \\frac{6.0 \\text{ m}}{6} = 1.0 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the condition for dynamic similarity, which requires that the Reynolds number for the first test must be equal to the Reynolds number for the second test ($Re_1 = Re_2$). The Reynolds number is given by $Re = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}$, where $L$ is the characteristic length (chord $c$ in this case).",
        "Step 5: Since the tests are performed in the same wind tunnel with the same air, the density ($\\rho$) and dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$) are constant and cancel out from both sides of the Reynolds number equality. This simplifies the condition to $V_1 c_1 = V_2 c_2$.",
        "Step 6: Solve for the unknown airspeed $V_2$: $V_2 = \\frac{V_1 c_1}{c_2} = \\frac{(60 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1.2 \\text{ m})}{1.0 \\text{ m}} = 72 \\text{ m/s}$.",
