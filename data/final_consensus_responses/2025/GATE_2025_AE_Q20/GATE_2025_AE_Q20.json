      "reasoning": "For a pair of point vortices with identical circulation (both clockwise $\\Gamma$), each vortex induces a velocity field on the other. This induced velocity is tangential to a circle centered at the inducing vortex and perpendicular to the line connecting the two vortex centers. Due to the clockwise circulation of both vortices, the induced velocities will cause the vortices to move in opposite vertical directions (if placed horizontally). Specifically, the left vortex will move downwards, and the right vortex will move upwards. This combined motion results in the entire vortex pair rotating clockwise around their common centroid (the midpoint between them). The magnitude of this induced velocity at each vortex is $\\Gamma/(2\\pi a)$. This rotation is characteristic of vortex pairs with the same sign of circulation, while vortex pairs with opposite signs of circulation would translate."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Recall the velocity field induced by a point vortex. For a vortex with circulation $\\Gamma$, the tangential velocity at a radial distance $r$ is $v_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$, and the radial component $v_r = 0$. The direction of $v_{\\theta}$ depends on the sign of $\\Gamma$ (conventionally positive for counter-clockwise). For clockwise circulation, the tangential velocity can be represented as $v_{\\theta} = -\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi r}$ (if $\\Gamma$ is taken as a positive magnitude).",
        "Step 2: Set up the geometry. Consider the two point vortices, V1 and V2, separated by a distance 'a'. Let V1 be at $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$ and V2 at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. Both have clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$. The common centroid O is at $(0,0)$.",
        "Step 3: Determine the velocity induced by V2 at the location of V1. Vortex V2 (at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$) induces a velocity at V1 (at $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$). The distance between them is $r = a$. Since V2 has clockwise circulation, and V1 is to its left, the induced velocity at V1 will be tangential to a circle centered at V2, directed downwards (negative y-direction). The magnitude of this induced velocity is $V_{V1} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$.",
        "Step 4: Determine the velocity induced by V1 at the location of V2. Similarly, Vortex V1 (at $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$) induces a velocity at V2 (at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$). The distance is $r = a$. Since V1 has clockwise circulation, and V2 is to its right, the induced velocity at V2 will be tangential to a circle centered at V1, directed upwards (positive y-direction). The magnitude of this induced velocity is $V_{V2} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$.",
        "Step 5: Analyze the combined motion. Vortex V1 moves downwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$, and vortex V2 moves upwards with velocity $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi a}$. These equal and opposite velocities, perpendicular to the line connecting the vortices, cause the pair to rotate around their common centroid O. Since V1 moves down and V2 moves up, the line joining them rotates clockwise, consistent with the clockwise circulation of the individual vortices.",
        "Therefore, the correct qualitative description is that the vortices rotate clockwise around each other about their centroid O, corresponding to option C."
