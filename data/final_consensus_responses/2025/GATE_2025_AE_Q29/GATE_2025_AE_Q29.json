Substituting this into the strain energy formula and integrating from $0$ to $L$: \n$U = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{(Px)^2}{2EI} dx$ \n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\int_{0}^{L} x^2 dx$ \n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{L}$ \n$U = \\frac{P^2}{2EI} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{3} - 0\\right)$ \n$U = \\frac{P^2 L^3}{6EI}$ \nThe question explicitly states to ignore contributions due to transverse shear, so this formula for strain energy due to bending is the correct expression.
