      "reasoning": "Longitudinal static stability refers to an aircraft's inherent tendency to return to its equilibrium angle of attack after being disturbed in pitch. For an aircraft to be longitudinally statically stable, two primary conditions must be met:\n\n1.  **Pitching Moment Coefficient Slope:** The rate of change of the pitching moment coefficient about the center of gravity with respect to the angle of attack, \\frac{\\partial C_{M,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha}, must be negative. A negative slope means that if the angle of attack increases, a nose-down (negative) pitching moment is generated, which tends to restore the aircraft to its original angle of attack.\n2.  **Center of Gravity (CG) vs. Neutral Point (NP):** The center of gravity (h) must be located forward of the neutral point (h_n). This condition is equivalent to having a positive static margin, defined as h_n - h > 0.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A. The center of gravity of the airplane should be aft of the neutral point.** This implies h > h_n, which results in a negative static margin and static instability. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **B. The center of gravity of the airplane should be forward of the neutral point.** This implies h < h_n, which results in a positive static margin and ensures longitudinal static stability. Therefore, this option is correct.\n*   **C. The stability coefficient \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} (C_m is the airplane pitching moment coefficient and \\alpha is the angle of attack) is positive.** For static stability, this coefficient must be negative. A positive value indicates static instability. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **D. The static margin is negative.** The static margin is defined as h_n - h. For static stability, the static margin must be positive. A negative static margin implies instability. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on these principles, option B is the correct condition for longitudinal static stability."
