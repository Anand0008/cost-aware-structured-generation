      "reasoning": "The outward flux of a two-dimensional vector field $\\vec{v}$ over a closed curve $C$ can be calculated using two primary methods: a direct line integral or by applying Green's Theorem (which is the 2D version of the Divergence Theorem).\n\n**Method 1: Direct Line Integral**\n1.  **Identify the vector field and curve:**\n    $\\vec{v} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$\n    The curve $C$ is the unit circle centered at the origin, defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n2.  **Determine the outward unit normal vector $\\hat{n}$:**\n    For a circle $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$ centered at the origin, the position vector is $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$. This vector points radially outward. For the unit circle ($R=1$), its magnitude is $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. Thus, the position vector itself is the outward unit normal vector:\n    $\\hat{n} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$\n3.  **Calculate the dot product $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{n}$:**\n    $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{n} = (x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}) \\cdot (x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}) = x^2 + y^2$\n4.  **Apply the curve condition:**\n    Since we are on the unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Therefore, $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{n} = 1$.\n5.  **Set up and evaluate the flux integral:**\n    The flux $\\Phi$ is given by $\\Phi = \\oint_C (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{n}) \\, ds = \\oint_C 1 \\, ds$.\n    The integral $\\oint_C ds$ represents the total arc length of the curve $C$. For a unit circle, this is its circumference.\n    Circumference $C = 2\\pi R = 2\\pi (1) = 2\\pi$.\n    So, $\\Phi = 2\\pi$.\n\n**Method 2: Green's Theorem (Divergence Theorem in 2D)**\n1.  **Identify the vector field components:**\n    For $\\vec{v} = P\\hat{i} + Q\\hat{j}$, we have $P=x$ and $Q=y$.\n2.  **Calculate the divergence of $\\vec{v}$:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n3.  **Apply Green's Theorem for flux:**\n    The flux $\\Phi$ is given by $\\Phi = \\iint_R (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v}) \\, dA$, where $R$ is the region enclosed by the curve $C$.\n    $\\Phi = \\iint_R 2 \\, dA$\n4.  **Evaluate the area integral:**\n    The region $R$ is the unit disk (the area enclosed by the unit circle). The integral $\\iint_R dA$ represents the area of this region.\n    Area $A = \\pi R^2 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$.\n    So, $\\Phi = 2 \\times \\pi = 2\\pi$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: $\\Phi = 2\\pi$. Numerically, $2\\pi \\approx 2 \\times 3.14159 = 6.28318$. Rounded off to two decimal places, the flux is $6.28$."
