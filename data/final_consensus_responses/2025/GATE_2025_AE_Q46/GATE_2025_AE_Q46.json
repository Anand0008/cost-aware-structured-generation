      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the value of $\\left[ \\frac{p_o - p}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2} \\right]$. This ratio can be expressed directly in terms of the Mach number ($M$) and specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$) for isentropic compressible flow. The steps are:\n\n1.  **Calculate the local speed of sound ($a$):**\n    $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J/kg\\cdot K} \\times 259 \\text{ K}} \\approx 322.63 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mach number ($M$):**\n    $M = \\frac{V}{a} = \\frac{230 \\text{ m/s}}{322.63 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 0.7129$\n\n3.  **Apply the direct formula for the ratio:**\n    The ratio $\\frac{p_o - p}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2}$ can be derived from the isentropic stagnation pressure relation and the definition of dynamic pressure as:\n    $\\frac{p_o - p}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2} = \\frac{2}{\\gamma M^2} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}} - 1 \\right]$\n\n4.  **Substitute values and calculate:**\n    $\\frac{p_o - p}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2} = \\frac{2}{1.4 \\times (0.7129)^2} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} (0.7129)^2\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{1.4-1}} - 1 \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{2}{1.4 \\times 0.508226} \\left[ \\left(1 + 0.2 \\times 0.508226\\right)^{3.5} - 1 \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{2}{0.7115164} \\left[ \\left(1.1016452\\right)^{3.5} - 1 \\right]$\n    $\\approx 2.8110 \\times [1.3866 - 1] \\approx 2.8110 \\times 0.3866 \\approx 1.0865$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the value is $\\mathbf{1.09}$. This value falls within the specified range of $1.08$ to $1.14$. It's important to note that the given ambient pressure, temperature, and density are not perfectly consistent with the ideal gas law ($p = \\rho R T$), which can lead to slight variations if one were to calculate $p_o-p$ and $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$ separately using the given $\\rho$ and $p$ values. The direct formula based on Mach number and specific heat ratio provides a consistent result for isentropic flow."
