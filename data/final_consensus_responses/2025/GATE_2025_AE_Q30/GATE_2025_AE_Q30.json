      "reasoning": "The undeformed plate is a square (rhombus with 90° internal angles), with its diagonals AC and BD aligned with the x and y axes, respectively. The deformation described (diagonal AC reducing, diagonal BD increasing) and visually depicted in the image shows that the displacement components $u_x$ are solely a function of $x$ (i.e., $u_x(x)$) and $u_y$ are solely a function of $y$ (i.e., $u_y(y)$). This implies that there is no relative tangential displacement between lines initially parallel to the x and y axes. Consequently, the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$ are both zero. Therefore, the engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = 0$. This deformation represents a pure normal strain along the x and y axes, preserving the right angle between these axes."

        "Analyze Deformation: Upon deformation, diagonal AC reduces to 19.96 cm, and diagonal BD increases to 20.04 cm. Crucially, the deformation is such that points initially on the x-axis (like B and D) only move along the x-axis, and points initially on the y-axis (like A and C) only move along the y-axis.",
        "Determine Angle Change: Since the initial shape is a square, its diagonals are perpendicular. The described deformation pattern (points moving only along their respective axes) ensures that the x and y axes remain perpendicular after deformation. Therefore, the angle between the x and y axes remains 90°.",
        "Recall Engineering Shear Strain Definition: The engineering shear strain \\gamma_{xy} quantifies the change in the angle between two line segments that were initially parallel to the x and y axes. It is defined as \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}, where u_x and u_y are the displacement components in the x and y directions.",
        "Evaluate Displacement Gradients: Due to the nature of the deformation (points on x-axis move only along x, points on y-axis move only along y), the displacement u_x is not a function of y (i.e., \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = 0), and the displacement u_y is not a function of x (i.e., \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = 0).",
