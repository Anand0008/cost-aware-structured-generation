The rocket is an ideal two-stage system with identical specific impulse, structural coefficient, and payload ratios. Let $m_{02}$ be the initial mass of the second stage (including its propellant, structure, and the final payload).",
        "Step 2: Understand the optimal staging condition. For an ideal two-stage rocket with identical specific impulse and structural coefficient, optimized for maximum delta-V, the payload ratios of both stages are equal. The 'payload' of the first stage is the entire second stage (mass $m_{02}$), and the 'payload' of the second stage is the final useful payload $M_L$.",
        "Step 3: Express the payload ratios for each stage. For the first stage, its payload is the entire second stage (mass $m_{02}$), so the payload ratio is $\\lambda_1 = m_{02} / M_0$. For the second stage, its payload is the final useful payload $M_L$, so the payload ratio is $\\lambda_2 = M_L / m_{02}$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the optimal staging condition by equating the payload ratios: $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2$. This gives $m_{02} / M_0 = M_L / m_{02}$. Substitute the given values: $m_{02} / 200 = 2 / m_{02}$.",
        "Step 5: Solve the equation for $m_{02}$. Cross-multiply to get $m_{02}^2 = M_0 \\times M_L$. Substitute the values: $m_{02}^2 = 200 \\text{ tons} \\times 2 \\text{ tons} = 400 \\text{ tons}^2$. Taking the positive square root, $m_{02} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$ tons.",
        "Step 6: The mass of the second stage (including the final payload) is 20 tons. This can be verified by checking the payload ratios: $\\lambda_1 = m_{02} / M_0 = 20 / 200 = 0.1$ and $\\lambda_2 = M_L / m_{02} = 2 / 20 = 0.1$.
