      "reasoning": "The problem involves a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) inscribed in a circle of radius r. This dodecagon is composed of 12 congruent isosceles triangles, each with two sides equal to the radius r and the included angle being the central angle of the dodecagon.\n1.  **Central Angle:** The central angle for a regular 12-sided polygon is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$.\n2.  **Area of one triangle:** The area of one such triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} r^2$.\n3.  **Area of one square:** The problem asks to form squares of side r. The area of one such square is $r^2$.\n4.  **Triangles per square:** To find how many triangles are required to form one square, we divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: $\\frac{r^2}{\\frac{1}{4} r^2} = 4$.\n5.  **Total squares:** Since there are 12 triangles available in total, and each numbered triangle is used only once, the total number of squares that can be formed is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$.\nTherefore, 3 squares can be formed, and 4 triangles are required for each square, which corresponds to option A."
