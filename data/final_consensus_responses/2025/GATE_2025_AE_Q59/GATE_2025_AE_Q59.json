      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the factor of safety (FoS) for a thin flat plate under a given plane stress state, using the von Mises yield criterion. First, the principal stresses ($\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$) must be determined from the given normal and shear stress components. For a plane stress state, $\\sigma_3 = 0$. Then, the von Mises equivalent stress ($\\sigma_e$) is calculated using these principal stresses. Finally, the FoS is found by dividing the material's uniaxial yield stress ($Y$) by the calculated von Mises equivalent stress ($\\sigma_e$).\n\n1.  **Given stresses:** $\\sigma_{xx} = 160$ MPa, $\\sigma_{yy} = 40$ MPa, $\\tau_{xy} = 80$ MPa.\n2.  **Uniaxial yield stress:** $Y = 250$ MPa.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Principal Stresses**\nFor a plane stress state, the principal stresses $\\sigma_{1,2}$ are given by:\n$\\sigma_{1,2} = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{xx} - \\sigma_{yy}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$\n\nMean stress: $C = \\frac{160 + 40}{2} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100$ MPa\nRadius of Mohr's Circle: $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{160 - 40}{2}\\right)^2 + (80)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{120}{2}\\right)^2 + (80)^2} = \\sqrt{(60)^2 + (80)^2} = \\sqrt{3600 + 6400} = \\sqrt{10000} = 100$ MPa\n\nPrincipal stresses:\n$\\sigma_1 = C + R = 100 + 100 = 200$ MPa\n$\\sigma_2 = C - R = 100 - 100 = 0$ MPa\nFor a thin flat plate (plane stress), the third principal stress is $\\sigma_3 = 0$ MPa.\nSo, the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = 200$ MPa, $\\sigma_2 = 0$ MPa, $\\sigma_3 = 0$ MPa.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Von Mises Equivalent Stress ($\\sigma_e$)**\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is given by:\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times [(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2]}$\n\nSubstitute the principal stresses:\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times [(200 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 200)^2]}$\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times [(200)^2 + 0 + (-200)^2]}$\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times [40000 + 40000]}$\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times 80000}$\n$\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{40000}$\n$\\sigma_e = 200$ MPa\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Factor of Safety (FoS)**\nFoS is defined as the ratio of the yield stress to the applied stress (von Mises equivalent stress):\n$N = \\frac{Y}{\\sigma_e} = \\frac{250 \\text{ MPa}}{200 \\text{ MPa}} = 1.25$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the factor of safety is $1.25$.
