      "reasoning": "To achieve a coordinated right turn, the aircraft must first roll to the right and then yaw to the right, while compensating for adverse yaw.\n\n1.  **Aileron Deflection for Right Roll**: To roll right, the right wing needs to lose lift, and the left wing needs to gain lift. This is achieved by deflecting the **right aileron UP** and the **left aileron DOWN**.\n\n2.  **Adverse Yaw Effect**: When the left aileron deflects downward, it increases the lift on the left wing, but also significantly increases the induced drag on that wing. This differential drag creates a yawing moment that pulls the left wing backward, causing the nose of the aircraft to yaw to the **LEFT**. This unwanted yaw is known as adverse yaw.\n\n3.  **Rudder Deflection for Coordinated Turn**: To counteract the adverse yaw (nose yawing left) and to achieve a coordinated turn to the right, the pilot must apply a compensatory yawing moment to the right. This is done by deflecting the rudder to the **RIGHT**.\n\nCombining these actions: Left aileron: down; Right aileron: up; Rudder: right. This matches option B."

When ailerons are deflected for a roll, the wing with the downward-deflected aileron (increasing lift) also experiences an increase in induced drag.

This differential drag creates a yawing moment opposite to the direction of the desired turn, specifically, causing the nose to yaw left for a right roll.",

        "description": "Design where the upward-deflecting aileron (on the descending wing) deflects more than the downward-deflecting aileron (on the rising wing), reducing the drag difference and thus adverse yaw.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Reduces the need for extensive rudder input to coordinate turns, simplifies pilot workload. Cons: Adds complexity to the flight control system, more complex mechanical design.",
        "when_to_use": "In aircraft where adverse yaw is significant and coordination is challenging for pilots."

        "name": "Vector reasoning with lift and drag on each wing",
        "description": "Draw both wings from top view, then sketch lift and induced drag vectors for each wing with aileron deflections. The wing with down aileron has larger lift and induced drag, pulling it back and causing yaw opposite to roll. Then deduce rudder direction needed to cancel this yaw and align nose with turn.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Gives strong physical intuition and reduces reliance on memorized rules. Cons: Slightly slower than recalling standard patterns; may be overkill for a 1-mark question.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful when you forget the sign conventions or want to verify your intuition about adverse yaw direction."

      "Aerodynamics": "Understanding of lift, drag, and especially induced drag (which varies with lift, $C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2$) is crucial for comprehending how ailerons generate adverse yaw.",
      "Control Systems": "Aircraft control systems often incorporate yaw dampers or control mixing to automatically compensate for adverse yaw, reducing pilot workload.",
      "Physics (Mechanics)": "The concept of moments (rolling moment, yawing moment) and forces (lift, drag) acting on a rigid body (aircraft) is fundamental.",
      "Aircraft Design": "Choice of aileron type (e.g., differential, Frise ailerons) and vertical tail sizing are design decisions influenced by adverse yaw and the required rudder authority to counteract it.",
      "Flight Dynamics": "Adverse yaw and its compensation through aileron-rudder coordination are key topics in aircraft flight dynamics and stability.",
      "Pilot Training": "Flight instruction emphasizes coordinated turns for efficient and safe flying."
