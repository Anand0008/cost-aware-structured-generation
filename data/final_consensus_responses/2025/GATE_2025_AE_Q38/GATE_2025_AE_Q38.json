      "reasoning": "The question describes an airplane perturbed with a small nose-up constant pitch rate ($q > 0$) and states that the pitch damping derivative $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative. We need to analyze the consequences for the horizontal tail.\n\n1.  **Effect of Pitch Rate on Tail Angle of Attack (Option A):**\n    When an aircraft pitches nose-up with an angular velocity $q$, a point on the horizontal tail, located at a distance $l_t$ (moment arm, positive for tail aft of CG) behind the center of gravity (CG), experiences an additional downward velocity component $w_t = q l_t$. This downward velocity component effectively increases the local angle of attack of the tail. The change in tail angle of attack due to pitch rate is given by $\\Delta \\alpha_t = \\frac{q l_t}{V}$, where $V$ is the freestream velocity. Since $q$ is positive (nose-up), $l_t$ is positive (tail aft), and $V$ is positive, $\\Delta \\alpha_t$ will be positive. Therefore, the angle of attack of the horizontal tail increases. **(Option A is TRUE)**\n\n2.  **Effect on Tail Lift (Option C):**\n    Assuming the horizontal tail is not stalled (as stated in the question) and has a positive lift curve slope ($a_t = \\frac{{\\partial C_{L,t}}}{{\\partial \\alpha_t}} > 0$), an increase in its angle of attack (from Option A) will lead to an increase in its lift coefficient ($\\Delta C_{L,t} = a_t \\Delta \\alpha_t > 0$). Consequently, the lift generated by the horizontal tail ($L_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S_t C_{L,t}$) will increase. **(Option C is TRUE)**\n\n3.  **Effect on Tail Pitching Moment (Options B and D):**\n    The pitching moment generated by the horizontal tail about the CG is $M_t = -L_t l_t$ (where a positive $L_t$ is typically upwards, creating a nose-down moment if $l_t$ is positive). An increase in tail lift ($\\Delta L_t > 0$) will result in a change in pitching moment $\\Delta M_t = -\\Delta L_t l_t$. Since $\\Delta L_t > 0$ and $l_t > 0$, $\\Delta M_t$ will be negative. A negative pitching moment is a nose-down moment. This nose-down moment *opposes* the initial nose-up pitch rate perturbation. A moment that opposes a perturbation is a *restoring* or *stabilizing* moment. Therefore, the contribution of the horizontal tail to the airplane's pitching moment about the center of gravity is more stabilizing. This is consistent with the given information that $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative, which implies a nose-down (stabilizing) moment for a nose-up pitch rate. **(Option B is TRUE, Option D is FALSE)**\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A, B, and C are true."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the perturbation and stability coefficient. The airplane is perturbed with a small nose-up constant pitch rate ($q > 0$). The given stability coefficient $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial q}$ is negative, which indicates pitch damping: a positive pitch rate generates a negative (nose-down) pitching moment, opposing the motion and providing a stabilizing effect.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the effect of pitch rate on the horizontal tail's angle of attack. For a conventional tail-aft airplane, the horizontal tail is located at a distance $l_t$ behind the center of gravity (CG). During a nose-up pitch rate ($q > 0$), the tail experiences an additional downward velocity component ($w_t = q l_t$). This downward velocity effectively increases the local angle of attack of the horizontal tail ($\\Delta \\alpha_t = \\frac{q l_t}{V}$). Therefore, statement A is true.",
        "Step 3: Determine the effect on horizontal tail lift. Since the horizontal tail is assumed not to stall and has a positive lift curve slope, an increase in its angle of attack (from Step 2) will lead to an increase in its lift coefficient. Consequently, the lift generated by the horizontal tail will increase. Therefore, statement C is true.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate the tail's contribution to the airplane's pitching moment. The pitching moment generated by the horizontal tail about the CG is $M_t = -L_t l_t$ (where $L_t$ is positive upwards, creating a nose-down moment if $l_t$ is positive). An increase in tail lift (from Step 3) will result in a more negative (nose-down) pitching moment contribution from the tail. This nose-down moment opposes the initial nose-up pitch rate perturbation, meaning the tail's contribution to the airplane's pitching moment is more stabilizing. This is consistent with the given $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial q} < 0$. Therefore, statement B is true, and statement D (less stabilizing) is false.",
        "Interpret the stabilizing effect. A nose-down moment generated in response to a nose-up pitch rate is a restoring moment, which acts to reduce the perturbation. This indicates a stabilizing effect. Since the tail is aft of the CG, increased tail lift (due to increased angle of attack from pitch rate) enhances this nose-down moment, making the tail contribution more stabilizing. The problem statement also explicitly mentions that $\\frac{{\\partial C_m}}{{\\partial q}}$ is negative, which means for a positive pitch rate ($q$), the change in pitching moment ($C_m$) is negative (nose-down moment), confirming a damping/stabilizing effect. Therefore, the tail's contribution is more stabilizing, confirming Option B and refuting Option D."
