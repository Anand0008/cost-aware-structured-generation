      "reasoning": "For a positively cambered airfoil, to achieve zero lift, it must be pitched nose-down relative to the freestream. This means its zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) is negative. This is because the inherent upward curvature (camber) generates lift at zero geometric angle of attack, which needs to be counteracted by a negative angle of attack to nullify the lift. Furthermore, a cambered airfoil inherently produces a non-zero pitching moment about its aerodynamic center ($C_{m_{ac}}$), which is constant with angle of attack and typically negative (nose-down, or clockwise in standard aerodynamic convention). Therefore, at the zero-lift angle of attack, there will still be a non-zero, nose-down pitching moment.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **Diagram A:** Shows a positively cambered airfoil with its chord line at a negative angle relative to the freestream velocity $U_{\\infty}$, consistent with a negative zero-lift angle of attack. The pitching moment $M$ is shown as clockwise, representing a nose-down moment, which is consistent with the inherent pitching moment of a cambered airfoil. This diagram accurately describes the scenario.\n*   **Diagram B:** Shows a positive angle of attack and a counter-clockwise (nose-up) moment. Both are incorrect for the specified conditions.\n*   **Diagram C:** Shows zero angle of attack (chord line aligned with $U_{\\infty}$). At $\\alpha=0$, a positively cambered airfoil generates positive lift, not zero lift. While the moment direction might be depicted correctly, the angle of attack is not for the zero-lift condition.\n*   **Diagram D:** Shows a symmetric airfoil (mean camber line coincides with the chord line). The question specifies a *positively cambered* airfoil. A symmetric airfoil at zero lift (which occurs at $\\alpha=0$) has zero pitching moment about its aerodynamic center. Thus, this diagram is incorrect on multiple counts.\n\nTherefore, Diagram A is the only accurate representation."

        "Understand the properties of a 'positively cambered airfoil': it has a curved mean camber line and generates positive lift at zero geometric angle of attack. Therefore, to achieve zero lift, it must be set at a small negative angle of attack, known as the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0} < 0$).",
        "Recall that for a positively cambered airfoil, the zero-lift angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) is negative, meaning the airfoil is pitched nose-down relative to the freestream to achieve zero lift. At this condition, while lift is zero, a pitching moment about the aerodynamic center ($C_{m_{ac}}$) is still present and constant.",
        "For conventional positively cambered airfoils, the pitching moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center ($C_{m_{ac}}$) is inherently negative (nose-down or clockwise) and constant, independent of the angle of attack. Therefore, even at the zero-lift angle of attack, a nose-down pitching moment exists.",
        "Since the lift is zero at $\\alpha_{L=0}$, the net aerodynamic force is zero. However, for a cambered airfoil, the pitching moment about the aerodynamic center is a pure couple and remains constant and negative (nose-down) even at zero lift.",
        "Examine the provided diagrams. The correct representation must show a positively cambered airfoil at a negative angle of attack ($\\alpha_{L=0}$) relative to the freestream velocity, and a clockwise (nose-down) pitching moment about its aerodynamic center (typically near the quarter-chord).",
        "Diagram A correctly depicts these characteristics: the airfoil is oriented at a negative angle of attack, and the pitching moment is shown as clockwise (nose-down), consistent with the theoretical behavior of a positively cambered airfoil at its zero-lift angle of attack."

Match these directly to the diagrams.",
