        "Step 1: Analyze Truss Geometry and Determinacy. The truss consists of three members (AB, BC, AC) each of length 1 m, forming an equilateral triangle. This means all internal angles are $60^\\circ$. The coordinates can be set as A(0,0), B(1,0), and C(0.5, $\\sqrt{3}/2$). There are 3 joints (A, B, C) and 3 reactions (pin at A: $A_x, A_y$; roller at B: $B_y$). Since $m+r = 2j$ ($3+3 = 2 \\times 3 \\implies 6=6$), the truss is statically determinate.",
        "Step 2: Calculate Support Reactions. Consider the entire truss as a free body. The external load is a 50 N horizontal force at C, pointing right. The height of joint C from the base AB is $h = L_{AC} \\sin(60^\\circ) = 1 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ m. Apply the equations of static equilibrium:\n*   $\\Sigma F_x = 0$: $A_x + 50 = 0 \\implies A_x = -50 N$ (acting left).\n*   $\\Sigma M_A = 0$: $B_y \\times 1 - 50 \\times (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 0 \\implies B_y = 25\\sqrt{3} N$ (acting upwards).\n*   $\\Sigma F_y = 0$: $A_y + B_y = 0 \\implies A_y = -25\\sqrt{3} N$ (acting downwards).",
        "Sum of moments about A ($\\Sigma M_A = 0$, clockwise positive): $P_C \\times h - B_y \\times L_{AB} = 0 \\implies 50 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - B_y \\times 1 = 0 \\implies B_y = 25\\sqrt{3}$ N (upwards).",
        "Sum of forces in x-direction ($\\Sigma F_x = 0$): $A_x + P_C = 0 \\implies A_x + 50 = 0 \\implies A_x = -50$ N (acting to the left).",

        "Apply Method of Joints at Joint C. Assume forces $F_{AC}$ and $F_{BC}$ are tensile (pulling away from the joint).",
