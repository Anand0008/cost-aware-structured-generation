      "reasoning": "The problem asks to find the material that results in the lowest weight of the rod, given a strength-based failure criterion. For an axial tensile load P, the stress $\\sigma$ in the rod is given by $\\sigma = P/A$, where A is the cross-sectional area. The strength-based failure criterion dictates that the actual stress must not exceed the material's yield strength, i.e., $\\sigma \\le \\sigma_{yield}$. To support the load P, the minimum required cross-sectional area $A_{min}$ is $A_{min} = P / \\sigma_{yield}$. The weight of the rod (W) is given by $W = \\rho \\times V = \\rho \\times A \\times L$, where $\\rho$ is the density and L is the length. Substituting $A_{min}$ for A, we get $W = \\rho \\times (P / \\sigma_{yield}) \\times L$. Since P and L are constant for all materials, to minimize W, we need to minimize the ratio $\\rho / \\sigma_{yield}$ (or maximize specific strength $\\sigma_{yield} / \\rho$).\n\nLet's calculate this ratio for each material:\n1.  **Material $\\alpha$**: $\\rho_{\\alpha} / \\sigma_{yield, \\alpha}$ = 2700 kg/m$^3$ / (270 $\\times$ 10$^6$ N/m$^2$) = 1.00 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ s$^2$/m$^2$\n2.  **Material $\\beta$**: $\\rho_{\\beta} / \\sigma_{yield, \\beta}$ = 4500 kg/m$^3$ / (900 $\\times$ 10$^6$ N/m$^2$) = 0.50 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ s$^2$/m$^2$\n3.  **Material $\\gamma$**: $\\rho_{\\gamma} / \\sigma_{yield, \\gamma}$ = 7800 kg/m$^3$ / (520 $\\times$ 10$^6$ N/m$^2$) $\\approx$ 1.50 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ s$^2$/m$^2$\n4.  **Material $\\delta$**: $\\rho_{\\delta} / \\sigma_{yield, \\delta}$ = 9000 kg/m$^3$ / (540 $\\times$ 10$^6$ N/m$^2$) $\\approx$ 1.67 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ s$^2$/m$^2$\n\nComparing these ratios, Material $\\beta$ has the lowest value (0.50 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ s$^2$/m$^2$). Therefore, Material $\\beta$ will result in the lowest weight of the rod."

        "**Step 1: Understand the Design Objective and Criterion.** The goal is to minimize the weight of the rod. The design must satisfy a 'strength-based failure criterion', meaning the tensile stress ($\\sigma$) in the rod must not exceed its yield strength ($\\sigma_{yield}$). For an axially loaded rod, the tensile stress is given by $\\sigma = P/A$, where P is the axial load and A is the cross-sectional area. Thus, we must have $P/A \\le \\sigma_{yield}$.",
        "Step 1: Determine the minimum cross-sectional area required to support load P without failure: $A_{min} = P / \\sigma_y$.",
        "Step 2: Express the rod's weight. Weight = density $\\times$ volume = $\\rho \\times (A \\times L)$, where L = 1 m is fixed.",
        "Step 3: Substitute $A_{min}$ into the weight equation: $W = \\rho \\times (P / \\sigma_y) \\times L = (\\rho/\\sigma_y) \\times P \\times L$.",
        "Step 4: Since P and L are constant across all material choices, the weight is directly proportional to the ratio $(\\rho/\\sigma_y)$. To minimize weight, choose the material with the smallest $(\\rho/\\sigma_y)$.",
        "Step 5: Compute $(\\rho/\\sigma_y)$ for each material using given properties. Ensure consistent units: density in kg/m$^3$, yield strength in Pa (1 MPa = 1e6 Pa).",
        "Step 6: Compare the computed ratios. Material $\\beta$ has the smallest value (0.5e-5), indicating it produces the lightest rod.",
