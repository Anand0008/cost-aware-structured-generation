      "reasoning": "The sentence describes an ongoing action in the past ('playing tennis') that was interrupted by another past event ('it suddenly started to rain'). To express an action that was in progress before another past action, the past perfect continuous tense ('had been playing') is required. This tense correctly conveys that the action of playing tennis was ongoing for a period of time and was interrupted or stopped by the rain. Option A ('have been playing') is present perfect continuous, referring to an action continuing to the present. Option C ('would have been playing') is a conditional perfect continuous, used for hypothetical past situations. Option D ('could be playing') implies present/future possibility or past ability. None of these alternatives fit the past-time context and the temporal relationship required by the sentence."

        "Recognize that the sentence describes an action that was in progress over a period of time in the past and was then interrupted by another past action.",
        "Recall the grammatical rule for such a scenario: the past perfect continuous tense is used for an action that began in the past, continued for some duration, and was ongoing or just completed when another past event happened.",
        "State the structure of the Past Perfect Continuous tense: Subject + had + been + Verb-ing.",
        "Evaluate the given options. Option B, 'had been playing', fits this structure and conveys the correct temporal relationship.",
        "Explain why 'had been playing' is correct: It indicates that the action of playing tennis started before the rain and was still ongoing at the moment the rain began, which interrupted it.",
        "Explain why other options are incorrect: 'have been playing' (present perfect continuous) links to the present; 'would have been playing' (conditional perfect continuous) implies a hypothetical situation; 'could be playing' (modal + present continuous) refers to present/future possibility or past ability.",
        "Conclude that 'had been playing' is the most appropriate option to complete the sentence."
