      "reasoning": "The given equation is $3^{x^2} = 27 \\times 9^x$. To solve for $x$, we express all terms with the same base, which is 3. We know that $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$. Substituting these into the equation gives: $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times (3^2)^x$. Using the exponent rule $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we get $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times 3^{2x}$. Applying the rule $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$, the equation becomes $3^{x^2} = 3^{3+2x}$. Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal: $x^2 = 3 + 2x$. Rearranging this into a standard quadratic equation yields $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+1) = 0$. This gives two possible values for $x$: $x=3$ or $x=-1$. The question asks for the value of the expression $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2}$. First, simplify the expression using exponent rules: $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2} = \\frac{2^{x^2}}{2^{2x}} = 2^{x^2 - 2x}$. Now, substitute the values of $x$ found: If $x=3$, then $x^2 - 2x = (3)^2 - 2(3) = 9 - 6 = 3$. So, the expression value is $2^3$. If $x=-1$, then $x^2 - 2x = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$. So, the expression value is $2^3$. Both values of $x$ lead to the same result, $2^3$. Therefore, the correct option is C."

        "Substitute these base-3 equivalents into the equation: $3^{x^2} = 3^3 \\times 3^{2x}$. Apply the product rule of exponents ($a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$) to combine the terms on the right side: $3^{x^2} = 3^{3+2x}$.",

        "Now, simplify the target expression $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{(2^x)^2}$. Apply the power of a power rule $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$ to the denominator, giving $\\frac{2^{x^2}}{2^{2x}}$. Then, apply the quotient rule of exponents $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$ to simplify it further to $2^{x^2 - 2x}$.",
        "From the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$, we can directly infer that $x^2 - 2x = 3$. Substitute this into the simplified expression $2^{x^2 - 2x}$, which gives $2^3$.",
