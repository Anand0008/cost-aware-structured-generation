      "reasoning": "At 5000 m, air density is lower than at sea level. The airspeed indicator measures dynamic pressure and is calibrated assuming standard sea-level density. Given 'no instrument errors and position errors', Indicated Airspeed (IAS) equals Calibrated Airspeed (CAS). Neglecting compressibility effects, Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) equals Equivalent Airspeed (EAS). Thus, IAS = CAS = EAS = 250 km/h. True Airspeed (TAS) is related to EAS by the dynamic pressure equality: \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_{TAS}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{SL} V_{EAS}^2, which simplifies to V_{TAS} = V_{EAS} \\sqrt{\\rho_{SL}/\\rho}. Since the actual air density (\\rho) at 5000 m is less than the standard sea-level density (\\rho_{SL}), the ratio \\rho_{SL}/\\rho is greater than 1. Therefore, V_{TAS} must be greater than V_{EAS}. As V_{EAS} = 250 km/h, it follows that V_{TAS} > 250 km/h. Based on this: (A) TAS > 250 km/h is TRUE; (B) CAS = 250 km/h is TRUE; (D) EAS = 250 km/h is TRUE. Consequently, (C) TAS = 250 km/h is FALSE, which is the correct answer."

        "Step 1: Understand the given information and assumptions. The problem provides an Indicated Airspeed (IAS) of 250 km/h at 5000 m altitude. Key assumptions are 'no instrument errors', 'no position errors', and 'neglecting compressibility effects'.",
        "Step 2: Relate Indicated Airspeed (IAS) to Calibrated Airspeed (CAS). Given 'no instrument errors and position errors', the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) is equal to the Indicated Airspeed (IAS). Therefore, V_{CAS} = V_{IAS} = 250 \\text{ km/h}. This confirms that option B is TRUE.",
        "Step 3: Relate Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) to Equivalent Airspeed (EAS). With 'neglecting compressibility effects', the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) is equal to the Equivalent Airspeed (EAS). Therefore, V_{EAS} = V_{CAS} = 250 \\text{ km/h}. This confirms that option D is TRUE.",
        "Understand the relationship between Equivalent Airspeed (EAS) and True Airspeed (TAS). EAS is defined as the speed at standard sea level density ($\\rho_{SL}$) that produces the same dynamic pressure ($q$) as the True Airspeed (TAS) at the actual flight density ($\\rho_{true}$). The dynamic pressure equation is $q = 0.5 \\rho V^2$.",
        "Formulate the dynamic pressure equality. Equating the dynamic pressure at actual flight conditions to the dynamic pressure at sea level for EAS: $0.5 \\rho_{true} V_{true}^2 = 0.5 \\rho_{SL} V_{EAS}^2$.",
        "Analyze the effect of altitude on air density. At an altitude of 5000 m, the air density ($\\rho_{true}$) is lower than the standard air density at sea level ($\\rho_{SL}$). This is a fundamental concept of the standard atmosphere.",
        "Derive the relationship between TAS and EAS. From the dynamic pressure equality, we can write $V_{true} = V_{EAS} \\sqrt{\\rho_{SL} / \\rho_{true}}$. Since $\\rho_{SL} > \\rho_{true}$ at altitude, the ratio $\\rho_{SL} / \\rho_{true}$ is greater than 1. Consequently, $\\sqrt{\\rho_{SL} / \\rho_{true}}$ is also greater than 1. This leads to the conclusion that $V_{true} > V_{EAS}$.",
        "Identify the FALSE statement. Based on the analysis, $V_{CAS} = 250 \\text{ km/h}$ (Option B is TRUE), $V_{EAS} = 250 \\text{ km/h}$ (Option D is TRUE), and $V_{true} > 250 \\text{ km/h}$ (Option A is TRUE). Therefore, the statement 'The true airspeed is 250 km/h' (Option C) is FALSE."

For navigation and flight planning, they convert to TAS to accurately determine ground speed (TAS +/- wind), estimate flight time, and calculate fuel burn. For example, an airliner at FL350 might show an IAS of \\u2248 280 kt but have a TAS of \\u2248 470 kt, or a Cessna 172 at 5000m with 250 km/h IAS would have a TAS of \\u2248 290 km/h.",

Then, calculate the density ratio `\\sqrt{\\rho_{SL} / \\rho_{true}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.225 / 0.736} \\approx 1.29`.
