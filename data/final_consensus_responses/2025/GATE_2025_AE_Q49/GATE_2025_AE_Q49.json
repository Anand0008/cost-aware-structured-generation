        "Step 1: Identify the flow phenomenon as a supersonic stream encountering a ramp, which generates an oblique shock wave. The pressure on the ramp surface is the post-shock static pressure $p_2$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the definition of the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for compressible flow, which can be expressed as $C_p = \\frac{2}{\\gamma M_1^2} \\left( \\frac{p_2}{p_1} - 1 \\right)$. This formula is derived from the general definition $C_p = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{q_1}$ and the compressible dynamic pressure $q_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma p_1 M_1^2$.",
        "Step 3: Express the freestream dynamic pressure ($q_1$) in terms of freestream static pressure ($p_1$), specific heat ratio ($\\gamma$), and freestream Mach number ($M_1$). For compressible flow, $q_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_1 V_1^2$. Using the relations $V_1 = M_1 a_1$ and $a_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$, and $\\rho_1 = \\frac{p_1}{R T_1}$, we can derive $q_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma p_1 M_1^2$.",
        "Step 4: Substitute the expression for $q_1$ into the $C_p$ formula: $C_p = \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\gamma p_1 M_1^2}$.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the formula to utilize the given pressure ratio $\\frac{p_2}{p_1}$: $C_p = \\frac{2}{\\gamma M_1^2} \\left( \\frac{p_2}{p_1} - 1 \\right)$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given numerical values into the formula: $M_1 = 5$, $\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = 7.125$, and $\\gamma = 1.4$.",
        "Step 7: Perform the calculation: $C_p = \\frac{2}{1.4 \\times 5^2} \\left( 7.125 - 1 \\right) = \\frac{2}{1.4 \\times 25} \\left( 6.125 \right) = \\frac{2}{35} \\times 6.125 = 0.0571428... \\times 6.125 \\approx 0.349999...$",
