      "reasoning": "For a supersonic wind tunnel operating with choked flow at the throat, the mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) is given by the formula: $\\dot{m} = A^* \\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{R}} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma + 1}{2} \\right)^{-\\frac{\\gamma + 1}{2(\\gamma - 1)}}$. For a given wind tunnel and gas, the throat area ($A^*$), ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$), and specific gas constant ($R$) are constant. Therefore, the mass flow rate is directly proportional to $\\frac{P_0}{\\sqrt{T_0}}$.\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of mass flow rates for two different conditions:\n$\\frac{\\dot{m}_2}{\\dot{m}_1} = \\frac{P_{02}/\\sqrt{T_{02}}}{P_{01}/\\sqrt{T_{01}}} = \\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}} \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{01}}{T_{02}}}$\nGiven:\n$\\dot{m}_1 = 2$ kg/s\n$P_{01} = 1$ MPa, $T_{01} = 800$ K\n$P_{02} = 3$ MPa, $T_{02} = 200$ K\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\frac{\\dot{m}_2}{2} = \\frac{3 \\text{ MPa}}{1 \\text{ MPa}} \\sqrt{\\frac{800 \\text{ K}}{200 \\text{ K}}}$\n$\\frac{\\dot{m}_2}{2} = 3 \\sqrt{4}$\n$\\frac{\\dot{m}_2}{2} = 3 \\times 2$\n$\\frac{\\dot{m}_2}{2} = 6$\n$\\dot{m}_2 = 12$ kg/s.\nThe final answer is 12 kg/s."
