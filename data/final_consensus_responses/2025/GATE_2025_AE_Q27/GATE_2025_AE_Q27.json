      "reasoning": "The problem involves a simply supported beam subjected to a linearly varying distributed load (triangular load) from $q_0$ at support A to zero at support B, over a length $L$. To determine the vertical reaction forces, we use the principles of static equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total resultant force (W) of the distributed load:**\n    The distributed load forms a triangle with base $L$ and height $q_0$. The area of this triangle represents the total resultant force.\n    $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times q_0$\n\n2.  **Locate the point of application of the resultant force (centroid of the triangle):**\n    For a triangular load, the centroid is located at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the base from the side with the maximum intensity (the 'heavy' end) and $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the base from the side with zero intensity (the 'light' end).\n    In this case, the maximum intensity $q_0$ is at A. So, the resultant force $W$ acts at a distance of $\\frac{1}{3}L$ from support A (or $\\frac{2}{3}L$ from support B).\n\n3.  **Apply the equations of static equilibrium:**\n    Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the vertical reaction forces at supports A and B, respectively.\n    *   **Sum of vertical forces:**\n        $\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B - W = 0$\n        $R_A + R_B = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L \\quad (Equation~1)$\n\n    *   **Sum of moments about support A:** (Taking counter-clockwise moments as positive)\n        $\\sum M_A = 0 \\implies R_B \\times L - W \\times (\\frac{1}{3}L) = 0$\n        Substitute $W = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L$:\n        $R_B \\times L - (\\frac{1}{2} q_0 L) \\times (\\frac{1}{3}L) = 0$\n        $R_B \\times L = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L^2$\n        $R_B = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n\n4.  **Solve for $R_A$ using Equation 1:**\n    $R_A = W - R_B = \\frac{1}{2} q_0 L - \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n    $R_A = (\\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}) q_0 L = \\frac{2}{6} q_0 L = \\frac{1}{3} q_0 L$\n\n5.  **Compare the magnitudes of the reaction forces:**\n    $R_A = \\frac{1}{3} q_0 L$\n    $R_B = \\frac{1}{6} q_0 L$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{3} > \\frac{1}{6}$, it is clear that $R_A > R_B$.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the vertical reaction force at A is larger than that at B. This confirms option A."

        "name": "Integration Method for Shear and Moment",
        "description": "This method involves expressing the distributed load $q(x)$ as a function of $x$. Then, the shear force $V(x)$ is found by integrating $q(x)$ (with a negative sign, $dV/dx = -q(x)$), and the bending moment $M(x)$ is found by integrating $V(x)$ ($dM/dx = V(x)$). The constants of integration are determined using boundary conditions, which can also yield the support reactions.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides the full Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams, generalizable to any load function, and reinforces calculus-based understanding. Cons: More computationally intensive and time-consuming if only reactions are needed, and can be prone to calculation errors with integration constants.",
