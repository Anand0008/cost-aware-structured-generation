      "reasoning": "The problem involves two main thermodynamic processes: isentropic compression and heat addition. First, the temperature after isentropic compression (T2) is calculated using the isentropic relation for an ideal gas: T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). The statement 'Eighty percent of the compressed air is supplied to a combustor' is a potential distractor. The heat addition of '0.88 MJ of heat is added per kg of air' is interpreted as per kg of air *flowing through the combustor*. Therefore, the heat added per kg of air entering the combustor is directly used in the energy balance for the combustor: q = Cp * (T3 - T2). Solving for T3 yields the final temperature. The calculated value of 1454.8 K falls within the expected range."

        "Calculate the temperature of the air leaving the compressor ($T_2$) using the isentropic temperature-pressure relation for an ideal gas: $T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$.",
        "Recognize that the given heat addition ($Q_{\\text{per total kg}} = 0.88 \\text{ MJ/kg}$) is per kg of *total* air, but only 80% of the air passes through the combustor. This implies that the actual heat added to the air *flowing through the combustor* is higher per unit mass of that flowing air.",
        "Apply the energy balance for the combustor. The heat added per kg of total air is related to the temperature change of the 80% air by $Q_{\\text{per total kg}} = 0.8 \\times C_p \\times (T_3 - T_2)$.",
        "Rearrange the energy balance equation to solve for the temperature of the air leaving the combustor ($T_3$): $T_3 = T_2 + \\frac{Q_{\\text{per total kg}}}{0.8 \\times C_p}$.",
