      "reasoning": "The problem describes an ideal ramjet with an optimally expanded exhaust, meaning the exit static pressure ($p_e$) is equal to the ambient static pressure ($p_0$). The fuel mass flow rate is negligible, so the mass flow rate through the engine is constant ($\\dot{m}_a = \\dot{m}_e$). The thrust ($F$) is calculated using the momentum thrust equation: $F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0)$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate ambient speed of sound ($a_0$) and flight velocity ($V_0$).**\nGiven: $T_0 = 260\\text{ K}$, $R = 287\\text{ J/kg/K}$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, $M_0 = 3$.\n$a_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287\\text{ J/kg/K} \\times 260\\text{ K}} = 323.215\\text{ m/s}$.\n$V_0 = M_0 a_0 = 3 \\times 323.215\\text{ m/s} = 969.645\\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate stagnation pressure at the combustor inlet ($p_{01}$).**\nFor isentropic compression in the diffuser:\n$\\frac{p_{01}}{p_0} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4-1}{2} \\times 3^2\\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{1.4-1}}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times \\left(1 + 0.2 \\times 9\\right)^{3.5} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times (2.8)^{3.5}$\n$p_{01} = 60\\text{ kPa} \\times 37.039 = 2222.34\\text{ kPa}$.\nFor an ideal ramjet, combustion occurs at constant stagnation pressure, so $p_{02} = p_{01} = 2222.34\\text{ kPa}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate nozzle exit Mach number ($M_e$).**\nThe nozzle expands the gas isentropically from $p_{02}$ to $p_e = p_0 = 60\\text{ kPa}$.\n$\\frac{p_{02}}{p_e} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}$\n$\\frac{2222.34\\text{ kPa}}{60\\text{ kPa}} = \\left(1 + 0.2 M_e^2\\right)^{3.5}$\n$37.039 = \\left(1 + 0.2 M_e^2\\right)^{3.5}$\n$(37.039)^{1/3.5} = 1 + 0.2 M_e^2$\n$2.8 = 1 + 0.2 M_e^2 \\implies 1.8 = 0.2 M_e^2 \\implies M_e^2 = 9 \\implies M_e = 3$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate exit speed of sound ($a_e$) and exit velocity ($V_e$).**\nGiven: $T_e = 700\\text{ K}$.\n$a_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_e} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287\\text{ J/kg/K} \\times 700\\text{ K}} = 530.339\\text{ m/s}$.\n$V_e = M_e a_e = 3 \\times 530.339\\text{ m/s} = 1591.017\\text{ m/s}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the thrust ($F$).**\nGiven: $\\dot{m}_a = 50\\text{ kg/s}$.\n$F = \\dot{m}_a (V_e - V_0) = 50\\text{ kg/s} \\times (1591.017\\text{ m/s} - 969.645\\text{ m/s})$\n$F = 50\\text{ kg/s} \\times 621.372\\text{ m/s} = 31068.6\\text{ N}$.\n$F = 31.0686\\text{ kN}$.\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, $F = 31.1\\text{ kN}$.
