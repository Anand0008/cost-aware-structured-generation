        "Step 2: Recall the solution criteria for homogeneous systems. A homogeneous system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$ always has at least the trivial solution ($\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$). It has a unique solution (only the trivial one) if the coefficient matrix $A$ is non-singular ($\\det(A) \\neq 0$ or $\\text{rank}(A) = n$). It has infinitely many solutions (non-trivial solutions exist) if $A$ is singular ($\\det(A) = 0$ or $\\text{rank}(A) < n$). The number of unknowns is $n=3$ ($x, y, z$).",

        "Step 4: Compute the determinant of $A$. $\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot1) - 3 \\cdot (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0) + 1 \\cdot (1\\cdot1 - 1\\cdot0) = 2(1) - 3(1) + 1(1) = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Conclude based on the determinant. Since $\\det(A)=0$, the coefficient matrix $A$ is singular, which implies the homogeneous system has infinitely many solutions.",
        "Step 6 (Optional: Verification via Rank): Perform Gaussian elimination on the coefficient matrix $A$. Swap $R_1$ and $R_2$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - 2R_1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - R_2$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The number of non-zero rows (pivots) is 2, so $\\text{rank}(A)=2$. Since the number of unknowns $n=3$ and $\\text{rank}(A) < n$, this confirms infinitely many solutions with $n - \\text{rank}(A) = 1$ free variable.",
