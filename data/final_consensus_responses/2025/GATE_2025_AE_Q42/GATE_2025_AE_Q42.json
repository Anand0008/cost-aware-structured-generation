The given curve $r = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (1 - \\sin \\theta)$ is a cardioid, which is traced completely as $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$. \n\nSubstituting $r$ into the formula:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (1 - \\sin \\theta) \\right)^2 d\\theta$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1 - \\sin \\theta)^2 d\\theta$\n$A = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1 - 2\\sin \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta) d\\theta$\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}$, the integral becomes:\n$A = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(1 - 2\\sin \\theta + \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\right) d\\theta$\n$A = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - 2\\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos 2\\theta\\right) d\\theta$\n\nNow, evaluate each term of the integral:\n$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{3}{2} d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\theta\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{2}(2\\pi) = 3\\pi$\n$\\int_0^{2\\pi} -2\\sin \\theta d\\theta = \\left[2\\cos \\theta\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\cos(2\\pi) - 2\\cos(0) = 2(1) - 2(1) = 0$\n$\\int_0^{2\\pi} -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos 2\\theta d\\theta = \\left[-\\frac{1}{4}\\sin 2\\theta\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\pi) - (-\\frac{1}{4}\\sin(0)) = 0 - 0 = 0$\n\nSumming the results of the individual integrals: $3\\pi + 0 + 0 = 3\\pi$.\nTherefore, $A = \\frac{2}{\\pi} (3\\pi) = 6$.\n\nAlternatively, for a cardioid of the form $r = a(1 \\pm \\sin \\theta)$ or $r = a(1 \\pm \\cos \\theta)$, the area is given by $A = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi a^2$.
