      "reasoning": "Lateral static stability refers to an aircraft's inherent tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance causes a bank or sideslip. This stability is primarily quantified by the rolling moment coefficient derivative with respect to sideslip angle, $C_{l_\\beta}$. For an aircraft to be statically stable in roll, $C_{l_\\beta}$ must be negative, meaning a positive sideslip angle produces a negative (restoring) rolling moment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. Wing with a positive dihedral angle:** Dihedral is the upward angle of the wings relative to the horizontal. When an aircraft with positive dihedral experiences a sideslip, the wing on the side towards the sideslip experiences a higher effective angle of attack compared to the other wing. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment, thus contributing to lateral static stability ($C_{l_\\beta} < 0$).\n*   **B. Fuselage with a high wing:** In a high-wing configuration, the fuselage is positioned below the wing. During a sideslip, the fuselage acts like a keel or a stabilizing surface below the wing's center of pressure. The airflow pushing against the side of the fuselage below the wing generates a side force that creates a restoring rolling moment, enhancing lateral static stability ($C_{l_\\beta} < 0$).\n*   **C. Fuselage with a low wing:** In a low-wing configuration, the fuselage is positioned above the wing. When a sideslip occurs, the fuselage above the wing does not provide the same stabilizing 'keel effect' as in a high-wing configuration. Instead, the aerodynamic interaction can produce a rolling moment that increases the bank, i.e., a positive contribution to $C_{l_\\beta}$, which is destabilizing. This configuration generally has a destabilizing or less stabilizing effect on lateral stability, often requiring additional dihedral to compensate.\n*   **D. Swept back wing:** Swept-back wings inherently contribute to lateral static stability. When an aircraft with swept-back wings experiences a sideslip, the wing advancing into the relative wind becomes effectively 'less swept' relative to the airflow and experiences an increased effective angle of attack and lift. Conversely, the lagging wing becomes 'more swept' and experiences a decreased angle of attack and lift. This differential lift creates a restoring rolling moment, contributing to lateral static stability ($C_{l_\\beta} < 0$).\n\nBased on this analysis, a fuselage with a low wing is the only option that has a destabilizing effect on static roll stability among the given choices."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define static roll (lateral) stability. Lateral static stability is the aircraft's tendency to return to a wings-level attitude after a disturbance causing a bank or sideslip. Mathematically, this requires the derivative of rolling moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle, C_l_beta, to be negative (C_l_beta < 0).",
        "Step 2: Understand that each design feature contributes a component to the overall C_l_beta. A destabilizing feature contributes a positive value to C_l_beta, making it less negative or even positive.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the effect of individual design features on C_l_beta:\n   - Positive dihedral angle: Creates a restoring roll moment, so (C_l_beta)_dihedral < 0 (stabilizing).\n   - High-wing configuration: The fuselage below the wing generates a restoring roll moment, so (C_l_beta)_high_wing < 0 (stabilizing).\n   - Swept-back wing: Creates a restoring roll moment due to differential lift, so (C_l_beta)_sweep < 0 (stabilizing).",
        "Step 4: Analyze the effect of a low-wing configuration. In a low-wing design, the fuselage above the wing can create a side force that produces a rolling moment in the direction of the sideslip, increasing the bank. This means (C_l_beta)_low_wing > 0 (destabilizing) or at least less stabilizing than a high wing.",
        "Step 5: Compare the effects. Since positive dihedral, high wing, and swept-back wings all contribute to lateral static stability (negative C_l_beta contribution), the low-wing configuration is the one that has a destabilizing effect (positive C_l_beta contribution) on static roll stability.",
        "Step 6: Conclude that the low-wing configuration is the design feature that has a destabilizing effect on static roll stability."

This method determines the rolling moment due to sideslip by deriving the contributions from individual components like the wing, fuselage, and vertical tail, using specific geometric and aerodynamic parameters. This involves more complex formulas and empirical relations.",

Cons: Computationally intensive, requires advanced aerodynamic knowledge, mathematical modeling, and detailed aircraft geometry/data, making it unsuitable for quick conceptual questions.",

      "Control Systems": "Aircraft stability is a prerequisite for effective control. Lateral static stability directly affects the need for and design of roll control systems (ailerons) and stability augmentation systems, as an unstable aircraft requires continuous and precise control inputs.",
      "Aircraft Design": "The principles of static stability directly inform the geometric layout and configuration choices (e.g., wing placement, dihedral angle, sweep angle) during the preliminary and detailed design phases of an aircraft, as it is a key handling quality requirement."
