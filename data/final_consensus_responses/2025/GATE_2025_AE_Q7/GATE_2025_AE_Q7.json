      "reasoning": "Let $W(a)$ be the weight of a person as a function of their age $a$. The problem states that $W(a)$ monotonically increases until the age of 50 years and then monotonically decreases. This implies that $a=50$ years is the age at which the person attains their maximum weight, and the function is unimodal.\n\nWe are given two brothers with ages $a_1$ and $a_2$, such that $a_1 < a_2$. They attain the same weight, meaning $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.\n\nFor two distinct ages $a_1$ and $a_2$ to have the same weight, given the function's unimodal behavior (increasing then decreasing with a peak at $a=50$), one age must be on the increasing part of the function and the other on the decreasing part.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If both ages were less than 50 (i.e., $a_1 < a_2 < 50$), then because $W(a)$ is strictly increasing for $a < 50$, we would have $W(a_1) < W(a_2)$. This contradicts $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.\n2. If both ages were greater than 50 (i.e., $50 < a_1 < a_2$), then because $W(a)$ is strictly decreasing for $a > 50$, we would have $W(a_1) > W(a_2)$. This also contradicts $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.\n3. If either $a_1 = 50$ or $a_2 = 50$, then for $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$ to hold, both ages must be 50 (since $W(50)$ is the unique maximum). This would mean $a_1 = a_2 = 50$, which contradicts the given condition $a_1 < a_2$.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario for $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$ with $a_1 < a_2$ is when $a_1$ is on the increasing part of the function and $a_2$ is on the decreasing part. This means $a_1 < 50$ and $a_2 > 50$. Combining these, we get $a_1 < 50 < a_2$.\n\nThus, statement B, $a_1 < 50 < a_2$, is correct."

        "description": "Sketch a simple graph of a function that increases to a maximum (e.g., at x=50) and then decreases. Plot two points with the same y-value (function output) and observe their x-values (inputs) must be on either side of the maximum. This visual representation helps confirm that if W(a1) = W(a2) with a1 < a2, then a1 must be before the peak and a2 after it.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Very intuitive, visual, fast for quick conceptual checks, reduces abstract thinking and algebraic confusion. Cons: May be less rigorous than analytical methods, relies on accurate sketching, can be time-consuming if not done quickly, some students may be hesitant to sketch under time pressure.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for conceptual problems involving qualitative function behavior (increasing, decreasing, maxima) without specific formulas, especially if struggling with abstract inequalities or when a quick mental sketch is sufficient."

        "description": "Use the fact that a strictly monotonic function on an interval is injective there. Argue that if both ages lie in the same monotonic interval (both < 50 or both > 50), equal weights force equal ages, contradicting a_1 < a_2. Then reason that the only remaining possibility is one age on each side of 50.",
        "name": "Injectivity Argument on Intervals",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Purely logical, no drawing needed; reinforces theoretical understanding of monotonic functions. Cons: Slightly more abstract; students unfamiliar with injectivity may find it less intuitive.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for students comfortable with function theory and when you want a rigorous verbal proof."

      "Calculus": "The concept of monotonically increasing/decreasing functions is directly related to the sign of the first derivative ($f'(x) > 0$ for increasing, $f'(x) < 0$ for decreasing). The peak at $a=50$ would correspond to $f'(50)=0$.",
      "Economics": "Many economic models use functions that exhibit increasing returns to scale initially, then decreasing returns, or production functions that peak at an optimal input level.",
      "Data Science": "Analyzing trends in data often involves identifying periods of increase, decrease, and peak values, which is a direct application of understanding monotonic behavior. This is similar to unimodal distributions in statistics where percentiles are interpreted.",
      "Biology": "Growth curves in organisms often follow similar patterns of increase and decrease.",
      "Control Systems": "Response curves (e.g., gain vs. frequency in Bode plots) can have peaks, and understanding multiple frequencies giving the same gain is analogous.",
      "Engineering Mathematics": "Concepts of monotonic functions, maxima, minima, and injective behavior are core topics in calculus and real analysis.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "Performance parameters like lift coefficient vs. angle of attack or drag vs. speed often show similar increase-then-decrease behavior, requiring similar reasoning.",
      "Human Factors Engineering": "This problem relates to the study of how human physical characteristics affect the design of aerospace systems.",
      "Mathematics": "Connected to calculus concepts of maxima and minima, and to algebra of inequalities. Homogeneous functions are also an important concept in multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
      "Propulsion": "Engine efficiency vs. compression ratio or thrust vs. Mach number may have optimal points with similar unimodal shapes."
