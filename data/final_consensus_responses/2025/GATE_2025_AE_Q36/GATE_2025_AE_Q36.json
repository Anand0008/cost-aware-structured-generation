      "reasoning": "The total lift ($L$) and induced drag ($D_i$) are determined by the Fourier coefficients ($A_n$) of the spanwise circulation distribution $\\Gamma(\\theta)$.\n\n**1. Total Lift (L):**\nAccording to Prandtl's lifting-line theory, the total lift coefficient $C_L$ for the entire wing is given by:\n$C_L = A_1 \\pi AR$\nwhere $A_1$ is the first Fourier coefficient and $AR$ is the aspect ratio of the wing.\n\nThe general Fourier series representation for circulation distribution is:\n$\\Gamma(\\theta) = 2bV_\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \\sin(n\\theta)$\n\nThe problem states the given circulation distribution is $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$. Comparing this to the general series, we can infer the coefficients:\n- For $n=1$, there is no $\\sin\\theta$ term, so $A_1 = 0$.\n- For $n=3$, we have $A \\sin 3\\theta = 2bV_\\infty A_3 \\sin 3\\theta$, which implies $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$.\n- All other $A_n = 0$.\n\nSince $C_L$ depends solely on $A_1$, and we found $A_1 = 0$, the total lift coefficient $C_L = 0 \\cdot \\pi AR = 0$. Consequently, the total lift $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_L = 0$.\n\n**2. Induced Drag (D_i):**\nThe induced drag coefficient $C_{D,i}$ is given by the formula:\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n^2$\n\nSubstituting the non-zero coefficient $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ into this formula (since $A_1=0, A_2=0$, etc.):\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (1 \\cdot A_1^2 + 2 \\cdot A_2^2 + 3 \\cdot A_3^2 + ...)$\n$C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 \\cdot A_3^2)$\n\nThe problem states that $A \\ne 0$. Since $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$, it follows that $A_3 \\ne 0$. Therefore, $A_3^2 \\ne 0$.\n\nThus, $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 A_3^2) \\ne 0$. Consequently, the induced drag $D_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_{D,i} \\ne 0$.\n\nBased on this analysis, $L = 0$ and $D_i \\ne 0$, which corresponds to Option B."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the given circulation distribution and its context. The problem provides the spanwise circulation distribution as $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$, where $A \\ne 0$. This form is used in Prandtl's lifting-line theory, where circulation is expanded as a Fourier sine series.",
        "Step 2: Recall the general Fourier series representation for circulation in Prandtl's lifting-line theory. The general form is $\\Gamma(\\theta) = 2bV_\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \\sin(n\\theta)$.",
        "Step 3: Compare the given distribution with the general form to identify the Fourier coefficients. By comparing $\\Gamma(\\theta) = A \\sin 3\\theta$ with the general series, we see that only the $n=3$ term is present. This means $A_1 = 0$, $A_2 = 0$, and $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ (since $A \\ne 0$).",
        "Step 4: Calculate the total lift (L). The total lift coefficient $C_L$ for the wing is directly proportional to the first Fourier coefficient, $A_1$, as per the formula $C_L = A_1 \\pi AR$. Since we determined $A_1 = 0$, it implies $C_L = 0$. Therefore, the total lift $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_L = 0$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the induced drag (D_i). The induced drag coefficient $C_{D,i}$ is given by the formula $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n^2$. Since only $A_3$ is non-zero in this case, the sum simplifies to $C_{D,i} = \\pi AR (3 A_3^2)$. As $A \\ne 0$, $A_3 = \\frac{A}{2bV_\\infty}$ is also non-zero. Consequently, $A_3^2 \\ne 0$, which means $C_{D,i} \\ne 0$. Therefore, the induced drag $D_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_\\infty V_\\infty^2 S C_{D,i} \\ne 0$.",
        "Step 6: Conclude based on the calculated lift and drag. From the analysis, $L=0$ and $D_i \\ne 0$.",
