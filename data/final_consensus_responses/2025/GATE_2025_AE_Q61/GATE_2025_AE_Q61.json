      "reasoning": "The total thrust for an unmixed turbofan with separate, optimally expanded nozzles and negligible fuel flow at static conditions is given by the sum of momentum thrusts from the core and bypass streams. The specific thrust per unit core mass flow rate is then derived from this total thrust.\n\nThe general thrust equation for an unmixed turbofan is:\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(1+f)V_e + \\dot{m}_{a,f}V_f - (\\dot{m}_{a,c} + \\dot{m}_{a,f})U_0 + (P_e - P_a)A_e + (P_f - P_a)A_f$`\n\nGiven conditions:\n1.  Bypass ratio `$\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{a,f}}{\\dot{m}_{a,c}} = 5 \\implies \\dot{m}_{a,f} = \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}$`\n2.  Fuel mass flow rate is negligible, so `f \\approx 0`.\n3.  Optimally expanded nozzles, so `P_e = P_a` and `P_f = P_a`. This means the pressure thrust terms `$(P_e - P_a)A_e$` and `$(P_f - P_a)A_f$` are zero.\n4.  Static specific thrust, so flight velocity `U_0 = 0`.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the thrust equation:\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(1+0)V_e + (\\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c})V_f - (\\dot{m}_{a,c} + \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}) \\times 0 + 0 + 0$`\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}V_e + \\alpha \\dot{m}_{a,c}V_f$`\n`$F = \\dot{m}_{a,c}(V_e + \\alpha V_f)$`\n\nThe question asks for the static specific thrust (`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c}$`):\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{a,c}(V_e + \\alpha V_f)}{\\dot{m}_{a,c}}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = V_e + \\alpha V_f$`\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n`$V_e = 600 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$V_f = 120 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$\\alpha = 5$`\n\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 600 \\text{ m/s} + 5 \\times 120 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 600 \\text{ m/s} + 600 \\text{ m/s}$`\n`$T/\\dot{m}_{a,c} = 1200 \\text{ Ns/kg}$`\n\nThe unit Ns/kg is equivalent to m/s, which is consistent with specific thrust (momentum per unit mass flow rate)."
