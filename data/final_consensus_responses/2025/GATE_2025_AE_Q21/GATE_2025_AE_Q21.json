      "reasoning": "The Mach number ($M$) is defined as the ratio of the flow velocity ($V$) to the local speed of sound ($a$), i.e., $M = V/a$. It is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the importance of compressibility effects in a fluid flow. Physically, the Mach number represents the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces. More precisely, the square of the Mach number ($M^2$) is proportional to the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces. Therefore, the Mach number itself is an estimate of the square root of the ratio of inertia forces to elastic forces. Elastic forces are associated with the compressibility of the fluid and the propagation of pressure waves (sound)."

        "Step 3: Identify the Relevant Forces. In fluid dynamics, inertial forces are associated with the fluid's momentum and resistance to acceleration (scaling with $\\rho V^2$). Elastic forces are associated with the fluid's compressibility and its ability to transmit pressure waves (sound), scaling with $\\rho a^2$.",
        "Step 4: Relate Mach Number to Force Ratio. The Mach number (or its square) is a dimensionless parameter representing the ratio of these forces. Specifically, the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces is proportional to $M^2$: $\\frac{\\text{Inertial Force}}{\\text{Elastic Force}} \\propto \\frac{\\rho V^2}{\\rho a^2} = \\frac{V^2}{a^2} = M^2$.",
        "Step 5: Conclude the Relationship. Therefore, the Mach number itself is proportional to the square root of the ratio of inertial forces to elastic forces: $M \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{Inertial Force}}{\\text{Elastic Force}}}$."
