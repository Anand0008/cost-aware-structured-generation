Immediately think of calculating the mass moment of inertia (I) and equivalent rotational stiffness (K_theta) and applying the formula \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K_\\theta/I}\\). Note that in some cases, lengths might cancel, making the answer independent of bar length.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If stuck, use physical intuition: stiffer springs or lighter bars lead to higher frequencies. Estimate values using the general form \\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K/I}\\). Be aware that common mistakes like using \\(I_{CM}\\) instead of \\(I_F\\) might lead to answers off by a factor (e.g., 1/2), which can help in educated guessing if options are provided. Often, the answer is a round number like 10 rad/s.",

For a rotational system, $T_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}I_F \\dot{\\theta}_{max}^2$ and $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}K_{eq,rot} \\theta_{max}^2$. Assuming harmonic motion $\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 \\sin(\\omega_n t)$, then $\\dot{\\theta}_{max} = \\omega_n \\theta_0$. Equating $T_{max}$ and $U_{max}$ yields $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eq,rot}}{I_F}}$.",
