        "Step 1: Identify the governing equation for an orbit. The polar equation of a conic section (orbit) with the focus at the origin and periapsis along the positive x-axis (where true anomaly $\\theta$ is measured from periapsis) is given by $r = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(\\theta)}$, where $r$ is the radial distance, $p$ is the semi-latus rectum, and $e$ is the eccentricity. Also, identify the given information: $r_F = 8000$ km at $\\theta_F = 0$ deg and $r_G = 10000$ km at $\\theta_G = 60$ deg.",
        "Step 2: Apply the orbital equation to point F. Substitute $r_F = 8000$ km and $\\theta_F = 0$ deg into the equation: $8000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(0^\\circ)}$. Since $\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1$, this simplifies to $8000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e}$ (Equation 1).",
        "Step 3: Apply the orbital equation to point G. Substitute $r_G = 10000$ km and $\\theta_G = 60$ deg into the equation: $10000 = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(60^\\circ)}$. Since $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$, this simplifies to $10000 = \\frac{p}{1 + 0.5e}$ (Equation 2).",
        "Step 4: Solve the system of two equations for the eccentricity $e$. From Equation 1, express $p$ in terms of $e$: $p = 8000(1 + e)$.",
        "Step 5: From Equation 2, express $p$ in terms of $e$: $p = 10000(1 + 0.5e)$. Equate the two expressions for $p$: $8000(1 + e) = 10000(1 + 0.5e)$.",
        "Step 6: Simplify and solve for $e$: Divide both sides by 1000: $8(1 + e) = 10(1 + 0.5e)$. Expand: $8 + 8e = 10 + 5e$. Isolate $e$: $8e - 5e = 10 - 8 \\implies 3e = 2 \\implies e = \\frac{2}{3}$.",

Check if answer options fall within this range.",
