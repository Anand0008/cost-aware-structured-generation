      "reasoning": "Statement A is TRUE: The condition for minimum glide angle (shallowest descent, maximum range) is achieved when the aircraft operates at its maximum lift-to-drag ratio, $(L/D)_{max}$. Therefore, the glide speed $V_g$ at minimum glide angle is indeed the speed corresponding to the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. This is a fundamental principle for maximizing glide range.\n\nStatement B is FALSE: The equilibrium glide velocity is given by $V_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(W/S)\\cos{\\theta}}{\\rho_{\\infty} C_L}}$. At minimum glide angle, $C_L$ is fixed at the value corresponding to $(L/D)_{max}$, and $\\cos{\\theta}$ is approximately 1 for small glide angles. Thus, $V_g$ is directly proportional to the square root of the wing loading $(W/S)$. Decreasing wing loading would therefore decrease $V_g$, not increase it.\n\nStatement C is FALSE: Altitude affects air density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$). Decreasing altitude means increasing air density. Since $V_g$ is inversely proportional to the square root of air density ($V_g \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho_{\\infty}}$), decreasing altitude would lead to a decrease in $V_g$, not an increase.\n\nStatement D is TRUE: Increasing altitude means decreasing air density ($\\rho_{\\infty}$). As $V_g$ is inversely proportional to the square root of air density, increasing altitude (and thus decreasing $\\rho_{\\infty}$) would lead to an increase in $V_g$."

For minimum glide angle, $\\theta$ is typically small, so $\\cos{\\theta} \\approx 1$.",

        "description": "Instead of using the analytical equilibrium glide velocity formula, one can use a graphical approach. This involves plotting the drag polar (C_D vs C_L) or L/D vs C_L to identify the point of maximum L/D, and then using the lift equation (L=W) to find the corresponding speed at a given altitude and wing loading.",
        "name": "Graphical Approach to Glide Performance",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides visual insight and a more intuitive understanding of the relationships. Cons: Requires more data (drag polar) and time, may be less precise than analytical methods, and is less suited for quick exam questions.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful in design courses or projects where full aerodynamic data is available and visualization of performance is desired."
