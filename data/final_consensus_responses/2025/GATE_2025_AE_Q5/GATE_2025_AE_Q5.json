      "reasoning": "Let the original length of the rectangle be $L$ and the original width be $W$. The problem states $L > W$.\n\nThe width, $W$, is increased by 10%. The new width, $W'$, will be:\n$W' = W + 0.10W = 1.10W$\nThe length, $L$, remains unchanged.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Perimeter increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Perimeter: $P = 2(L + W)$\nNew Perimeter: $P' = 2(L + W') = 2(L + 1.10W) = 2L + 2.20W$\nPercentage change in Perimeter $= \\frac{P' - P}{P} \\times 100 = \\frac{(2L + 2.20W) - (2L + 2W)}{2L + 2W} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.20W}{2L + 2W} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.10W}{L + W} \\times 100$\nThis expression is not equal to 10% for all values of $L$ and $W$. For example, if $L=W$, it would be $\\frac{0.10W}{2W} \\times 100 = 5\\%$. If $L$ is much larger than $W$, the percentage increase would be even smaller. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B. Length of the diagonals increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Diagonal Length: $D = \\sqrt{L^2 + W^2}$\nNew Diagonal Length: $D' = \\sqrt{L^2 + (W')^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + (1.10W)^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + 1.21W^2}$\nPercentage change in Diagonal Length $= \\frac{D' - D}{D} \\times 100 = \\frac{\\sqrt{L^2 + 1.21W^2} - \\sqrt{L^2 + W^2}}{\\sqrt{L^2 + W^2}} \\times 100$\nThis expression is not equal to 10% for all values of $L$ and $W$. It depends on the specific values of $L$ and $W$. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. Area increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Area: $A = L \\times W$\nNew Area: $A' = L \\times W' = L \\times (1.10W) = 1.10 \\times (L \\times W) = 1.10A$\nPercentage change in Area $= \\frac{A' - A}{A} \\times 100 = \\frac{1.10A - A}{A} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.10A}{A} \\times 100 = 10\\%$\nThis statement is correct for all values of $L$ and $W$, as the area is directly proportional to the width (when length is constant). Thus, option C is correct.\n\n**D. The rectangle becomes a square.**\nA rectangle becomes a square if its length equals its width. Initially, $L > W$. After the change, the new dimensions are $L$ and $W' = 1.10W$. For the rectangle to become a square, we would need $L = W'$. This condition ($L = 1.10W$) is only true for a specific ratio of $L$ to $W$, not for all values of $L$ and $W$ where $L > W$. For example, if $L = 2W$, then $L = 2W$ and $W' = 1.1W$. Since $2W \\neq 1.1W$, it does not become a square. Thus, option D is incorrect."
