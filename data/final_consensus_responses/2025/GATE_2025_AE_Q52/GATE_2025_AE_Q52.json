Given: climb rate \\(V_v = 10\\,\\text{m/s}\\), speed \\(V = 80\\,\\text{m/s}\\), so \\(\\sin\\gamma = V_v/V = 10/80 = 0.125\\). Air density \\(\\rho = 0.8\\,\\text{kg/m}^3\\), \\(C_L = 0.8\\), aspect ratio \\(AR = 6\\), Oswald efficiency \\(e = 0.8\\), zero-lift drag coefficient \\(C_{D0} = 0.02\\).\n\n1. Calculate the climb angle \\(\\gamma\\):\n   \\(\\sin\\gamma = V_v/V = 10/80 = 0.125\\)\n   \\(\\cos\\gamma = \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\gamma} = \\sqrt{1-0.125^2} \\approx 0.9922\\)\n\n2. Calculate the total drag coefficient \\(C_D\\) using the drag polar equation:\n   \\(C_D = C_{D0} + C_L^2/(\\pi e AR)\\)\n   \\(C_D = 0.02 + 0.8^2/(\\pi\\cdot 0.8\\cdot 6) \\approx 0.02 + 0.64/15.0796 \\approx 0.02 + 0.0424 \\approx 0.0624\\)\n\n3. Apply force balance equations for steady climbing flight:\n   Along the flight path: \\(T - D - W \\sin\\gamma = 0 \\implies T = D + W \\sin\\gamma\\)\n   Perpendicular to the flight path: \\(L = W \\cos\\gamma\\)\n\n4. Express the thrust-to-weight ratio \\(T/W\\):\n   Divide the thrust equation by \\(W\\): \\(T/W = D/W + \\sin\\gamma\\)\n   From \\(L = W \\cos\\gamma\\), we have \\(W = L/\\cos\\gamma\\). Also, \\(D = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 S C_D\\) and \\(L = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 S C_L\\).\n   So, \\(D/W = (\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 S C_D) / (\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 S C_L / \\cos\\gamma) = (C_D/C_L) \\cos\\gamma\\)\n   Therefore, \\(T/W = (C_D/C_L) \\cos\\gamma + \\sin\\gamma\\)\n\n5. Substitute the calculated values:\n   \\(C_D/C_L \\approx 0.0624/0.8 = 0.078\\)\n   \\(T/W \\approx 0.078 \\times 0.9922 + 0.125 \\approx 0.07739 + 0.125 \\approx 0.20239\\)\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, the thrust-to-weight ratio is 0.2."
