According to standard wing-bending theory and the provided context, the 'Negative Low Angle of Attack (AoA)' condition is precisely characterized by critical compressive stresses in the lower-aft region of the wing cross-section and maximum tensile stresses in the upper-forward region. This description perfectly matches the observations provided in the question. Other options describe different stress distributions: Positive High AoA has compression in upper-forward and tension in lower-aft; Negative High AoA has tension in lower-forward and compression in upper-aft; Positive Low AoA has tension in upper-rear and compression in lower-front. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, Negative Low Angle of Attack."

        "Recall the four basic symmetrical flight loading conditions corresponding to the V-n diagram corners: Positive High Angle of Attack, Positive Low Angle of Attack, Negative High Angle of Attack, and Negative Low Angle of Attack. Each condition results in a characteristic bending and torsional stress distribution across the wing cross-section.",
        "Analyze the specific stress distribution provided in the question: maximum compressive bending stresses are in the 'Bottom Aft' region, and maximum tensile bending stresses are in the 'Upper Forward' region.",
        "Recall the characteristic stress distributions for each critical loading condition:\n*   Positive High AoA: Compressive in upper-forward, Tensile in lower-aft.\n*   Positive Low AoA: Compressive in lower-front, Tensile in upper-rear.\n*   Negative High AoA: Compressive in upper-aft, Tensile in lower-forward.\n*   Negative Low AoA: Compressive in lower-aft, Tensile in upper-forward.",
        "Compare the given stress pattern (compressive in lower-aft, tensile in upper-forward) with the known distributions. This pattern directly matches the characteristics of a 'Negative Low Angle of Attack' condition.",
