We are given a drag polar \\(C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2\\), aircraft weight, wing area, air density, and maximum available thrust (1 kN). For a given speed, lift coefficient is \\(C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}\\). Substituting this into the drag polar and then into the drag equation \\(D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D\\) gives drag as a function of speed. Setting \\(D = T_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\text{N}\\) and solving for \\(V\\) yields the maximum cruise speed. \n\nGiven: \\(W = 10\\,\\text{kN} = 10000\\,\\text{N}\\), \\(S = 15\\,\\text{m}^2\\), \\(\\rho = 0.60\\,\\text{kg/m}^3\\), \\(C_{D_0} = 0.025\\), \\(K = 0.05\\), \\(T_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\text{N}\\).\n\n1) Express \\(C_L\\) in terms of \\(V\\):\n\\[ C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S} = \\frac{2 \\times 10000}{0.6 V^2 \\times 15} = \\frac{20000}{9 V^2} = \\frac{2222.22}{V^2}. \\]\n2) Then \\(C_L^2 = \\frac{(2222.22)^2}{V^4} \\approx \\frac{4.94 \\times 10^6}{V^4}.\\)\n3) Drag coefficient:\n\\[ C_D = 0.025 + 0.05 C_L^2 = 0.025 + 0.05 \\cdot \\frac{4.94 \\times 10^6}{V^4} = 0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}. \\]\n4) Drag:\n\\[ D = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D = 0.5 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 15 \\cdot V^2 \\left(0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}\\right). \\]\nThe constant in front is \\(0.5 \\times 0.6 \\times 15 = 4.5\\), so\n\\[ D = 4.5 V^2 \\left(0.025 + \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^4}\\right) = 4.5(0.025 V^2) + 4.5 \\cdot \\frac{2.47 \\times 10^5}{V^2}. \\]\nCompute coefficients:\n\\(4.5 \\times 0.025 = 0.1125\\), and \\(4.5 \\times 2.47 \\times 10^5 \\approx 1.1115 \\times 10^6\\).

For steady, level cruise flight, Lift (L) = Weight (W) and Thrust (T) = Drag (D). The drag coefficient is given by the drag polar: C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2.",
        "Write the lift equation to find $C_L$ in terms of velocity ($V$). From $L=W$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L = W$. Therefore, $C_L = \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S}$.",
        "Write the drag force equation and apply the thrust-drag equilibrium: $T = D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_D$. Substitute the drag polar $C_D = C_{D_0} + K C_L^2$ into this equation, yielding $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S (C_{D_0} + K C_L^2)$.",
        "Substitute the expression for $C_L$ from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2. This gives $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S \\left[ C_{D_0} + K \\left( \\frac{2W}{\\rho V^2 S} \\right)^2 \\right]$.",
        "Substitute all known numerical values into the equation: $W = 10000\\,\\text{N}$, $S = 15\\,\\text{m}^2$, $C_{D_0} = 0.025$, $K = 0.05$, $\\rho = 0.60\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $T = 1000\\,\\text{N}$. The equation becomes: $1000 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.60) V^2 (15) \\left[ 0.025 + 0.05 \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 10000}{0.60 \\times V^2 \\times 15} \\right)^2 \\right]$.",
        "Simplify the equation. This reduces to $1000 = 4.5 V^2 \\left[ 0.025 + \\frac{111111.11}{V^4} \\right]$, or $1000 = 0.1125 V^2 + \\frac{500000}{V^2}$.",
        "Multiply through by $V^2$ and rearrange into a quadratic in $V^2$. Let $x = V^2$. The equation becomes $0.1125 x^2 - 1000 x + 500000 = 0$.",
        "Solve the quadratic equation for $x$. The solutions are $x \\approx 1300.8$ and $x \\approx 7587.1$. Therefore, $V = \\sqrt{x} \\approx 36.1\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $V \\approx 87.1\\,\\text{m/s}$. The maximum cruise speed is the higher value, which rounds to 87 m/s."
