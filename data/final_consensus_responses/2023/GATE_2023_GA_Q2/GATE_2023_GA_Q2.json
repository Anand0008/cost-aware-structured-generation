Applying this same logical relationship to 'References : ______', the appropriate action performed with or on references is to *cite* them. To cite means to refer to a source of information, which accurately completes the analogy. Options such as 'Sight' (vision), 'Site' (location), and 'Plagiarise' (stealing work) do not maintain this specific action-object relationship, with 'Sight' and 'Site' also serving as homophone distractors."
