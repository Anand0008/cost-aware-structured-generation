The solution becomes $y(x) \\to \\frac{1}{a^2 + \\omega^2} (a \\sin(\\omega x) - \\omega \\cos(\\omega x))$. This is a sinusoidal term with amplitude $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}}$. Since $\\omega \\neq 0$ (implied by $\\sin(\\omega x)$), this amplitude is non-zero. Thus, $y(x)$ oscillates and does not tend to 0. So, A is incorrect.\n*   If $a < 0$: Let $a = -k$ where $k > 0$. Then $e^{-ax} = e^{kx}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $e^{kx} \\to \\infty$. The term $K e^{kx}$ dominates, and $y(x)$ grows unboundedly. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**B. $y \\to 1$ if $a = 0$**\nIf $a = 0$, the original ODE becomes $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\sin(\\omega x)$.\nIntegrating directly: $y(x) = -\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega x) + K'$\nApplying $y(0) = 1$: $1 = -\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cos(0) + K' \\implies 1 = -\\frac{1}{\\omega} + K' \\implies K' = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\omega}$\nSo, $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\omega} - \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega x)$.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $\\cos(\\omega x)$ oscillates between -1 and 1. Thus, $y(x)$ oscillates between $1 + \\frac{1}{\\omega} - \\frac{1}{\\omega} = 1$ and $1 + \\frac{1}{\\omega} + \\frac{1}{\\omega} = 1 + \\frac{2}{\\omega}$. It does not tend to 1 (unless $\\omega \\to \\infty$, which is not given). So, B is incorrect.\n\n**C. $y \\to A \\exp(|a|x)$ if $a < 0$; A is a constant**\nIf $a < 0$, let $a = -k$ where $k > 0$. Then $|a| = k$. The solution is:\n$y(x) = \\frac{1}{a^2 + \\omega^2} (a \\sin(\\omega x) - \\omega \\cos(\\omega x)) + K e^{kx}$\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the exponential term $K e^{kx}$ (which is $K e^{|a|x}$) dominates because $k > 0$. The sinusoidal term remains bounded. Thus, $y(x) \\to K e^{|a|x}$. Since $K = 1 + \\frac{\\omega}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$ is a constant, this statement is correct. So, C is correct.\n\n**D. $y \\to B \\sin(\\omega x + C)$ if $a > 0$; B and C are constants**\nIf $a > 0$, as $x \\to \\infty$, the transient term $K e^{-ax} \\to 0$. The solution approaches the steady-state part:\n$y_{ss}(x) = \\frac{1}{a^2 + \\omega^2} (a \\sin(\\omega x) - \\omega \\cos(\\omega x))$\nThis can be expressed in the amplitude-phase form $R \\sin(\\theta + \\phi)$. Let $R \\sin(\\omega x + \\phi) = R (\\sin(\\omega x) \\cos(\\phi) + \\cos(\\omega x) \\sin(\\phi))$.\nComparing coefficients: $R \\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{a}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$ and $R \\sin(\\phi) = -\\frac{\\omega}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$.\nSo, $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{a^2 + \\omega^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\omega}{a^2 + \\omega^2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}}{a^2 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}}$.\nAnd $\\phi = \\arctan2(-\\omega, a)$.\nTherefore, $y_{ss}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}} \\sin(\\omega x + \\phi)$.\nThis is of the form $B \\sin(\\omega x + C)$ where $B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}}$ and $C = \\phi$ are constants. So, D is correct."
