This is because the gradient vector $\\nabla\\phi$ points in the direction of the steepest increase of the scalar field. Its magnitude, $|\\nabla\\phi|$, represents the value of this maximum rate of change. This is a fundamental concept in vector calculus. Options B, C, and D involve other vector operations or quantities that do not correspond to the direction of the largest rate of change. For example, option B is the curl of $\\phi\\vec{r}$, option C is the scalar field multiplied by the position vector, and option D involves a scalar differential multiplied by $\\vec{r}$."
