      "reasoning": "The analysis of each option, supported by fundamental principles of mechanics of materials, confirms that statements A and D are true, while B and C are false.\n\n**Option A:** 'Maximum or major principal stress is algebraically the largest direct stress at a point.' This is a fundamental definition in stress analysis. The major principal stress ($\\sigma_1$) is always the algebraically greatest stress. Thus, statement A is **TRUE**.\n\n**Option B:** 'The magnitude of minor principal stress cannot be greater than the magnitude of major principal stress.' This statement is **FALSE**. While the major principal stress is algebraically greater than the minor principal stress ($\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2$), the *magnitude* (absolute value) of the minor principal stress can be greater if one stress is tensile (positive) and the other is compressive (negative). For example, if $\\sigma_1 = 10 \\text{ MPa}$ (tensile) and $\\sigma_2 = -20 \\text{ MPa}$ (compressive), then algebraically $\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2$, but $|\\sigma_2| = 20 \\text{ MPa}$ which is greater than $|\\sigma_1| = 10 \\text{ MPa}$.\n\n**Option C:** 'The planes of maximum shear stress are inclined at 90 degrees to the principal axes.' This statement is **FALSE**. The planes of maximum shear stress are always oriented at 45 degrees to the principal planes in the physical element. On Mohr's Circle, this angular relationship is represented by a 90-degree rotation (since angles on Mohr's Circle are $2\\theta$).\n\n**Option D:** 'The normal stresses along the planes of maximum shear stress are equal.' This statement is **TRUE**. On the planes of maximum in-plane shear stress, the normal stress is always equal to the average normal stress, $\\sigma_{avg} = (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) / 2$. Since there is only one value for the average normal stress, the normal stresses on both planes of maximum shear stress are equal to this average normal stress."

        "Step 1: Understand the definitions of principal stresses and principal planes. Principal stresses ($\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$) are the maximum and minimum normal stresses at a point, acting on planes where shear stress is zero (principal planes).",
        "Step 2: Evaluate statement A. The major principal stress ($\\sigma_1$) is, by definition, the algebraically largest normal stress at a point. This definition accounts for both positive (tensile) and negative (compressive) values, making statement A true.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate statement B. While $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2$ algebraically, the absolute magnitude of the minor principal stress ($\\sigma_2$) can be greater than that of the major principal stress ($\\sigma_1$). For example, if $\\sigma_1 = +50$ MPa and $\\sigma_2 = -100$ MPa, then $|\\sigma_2| > |\\sigma_1|$. Therefore, statement B is false.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate statement C. The planes of maximum shear stress are oriented at 45 degrees to the principal planes in the physical element. A 90-degree inclination would mean they are perpendicular, which is incorrect. Therefore, statement C is false.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate statement D. On the planes of maximum in-plane shear stress, the normal stress component is equal to the average normal stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}$). Since $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}$ is a constant for a given stress state, the normal stresses on both planes of maximum shear stress are equal. Therefore, statement D is true.",

Recall basic Mohr's circle facts: principal planes have zero shear; max shear planes are 45° from principal; normal stress on max shear planes is \\(\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}\\). Eliminate any option contradicting these rules.",
