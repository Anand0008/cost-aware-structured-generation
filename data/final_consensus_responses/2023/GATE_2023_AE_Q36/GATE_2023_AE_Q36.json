Then, we use the second derivative test $y''(x)$ to determine if these critical points correspond to a local minimum or maximum.\n\nGiven function: $y(x) = (x + 3)(x - 2)$\n\nStep 1: Expand the function.\n$y(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6$\n$y(x) = x^2 + x - 6$\n\nStep 2: Find the first derivative $y'(x)$.\n$y'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + x - 6) = 2x + 1$\n\nStep 3: Set the first derivative to zero to find critical points.\n$2x + 1 = 0$\n$2x = -1$\n$x = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nStep 4: Find the second derivative $y''(x)$ to determine the nature of the critical point.\n$y''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 1) = 2$\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the second derivative at the critical point.\nSince $y''(x) = 2$, which is greater than 0, the critical point $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nStep 6: Check if the critical point is within the given domain.\nThe domain is $-4 < x < 4$. The value $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ is indeed within this domain.\n\nTherefore, the function has a minimum at $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. This matches option B."
