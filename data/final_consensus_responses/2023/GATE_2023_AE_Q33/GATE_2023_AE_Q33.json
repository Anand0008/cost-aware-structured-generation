      "reasoning": "The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the formula $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, where $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats, $R$ is the specific gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The specific gas constant $R$ can be expressed as $R = \\frac{R_u}{M}$, where $R_u$ is the universal gas constant and $M$ is the molecular weight of the gas. Substituting this into the speed of sound formula gives $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma R_u T}{M}}$.\n\nFor this problem, both H₂ and N₂ are diatomic gases. It is standard to assume that the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) for diatomic gases is approximately 1.4. The temperature ($T = 300$ K) and the universal gas constant ($R_u$) are the same for both gases.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the speed of sound in H₂ to N₂ can be simplified as:\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{H_2} R_u T}{M_{H_2}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{N_2} R_u T}{M_{N_2}}}} $$\nSince $\\gamma_{H_2} = \\gamma_{N_2}$, $R_u$ is constant, and $T$ is constant:\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{N_2}}{M_{H_2}}} $$\\nGiven $M_{H_2} = 2$ kg/kmol and $M_{N_2} = 28$ kg/kmol:\n$$ \\frac{a_{H_2}}{a_{N_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{28}{2}} = \\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.741657 $$\\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 3.74. The pressure (2 bar) is irrelevant for the speed of sound in an ideal gas. This value falls within the specified correct answer range of 3.5 to 4.0."

        "Step 5: Assume both gases are diatomic with $\\gamma_{H_2} = \\gamma_{N_2} = 1.4$ (common at 300 K). The ratio simplifies to $\\sqrt{M_{N_2} / M_{H_2}}$.",
