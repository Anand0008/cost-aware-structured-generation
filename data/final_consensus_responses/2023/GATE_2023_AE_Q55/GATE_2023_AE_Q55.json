The standard definition is $\\Phi = Q / (\\omega D^3)$, where $Q$ is the volume flow rate. The condition states the flow rate $Q$ remains constant. Using the affinity law for power with respect to speed (from RAG chunks 1 & 4), $P \\propto \\omega^3$ only if $\\Phi$ (i.e., dynamic similarity) is maintained. However, here $Q$ is constant, so $\\Phi \\propto 1/\\omega$. Substituting into the given relation $C_p = a \\Phi^2$, we find $P \\propto \\omega$. Therefore, increasing $\\omega$ by a factor of 1.25 increases $P$ by the same factor: $\\alpha = 1.25$."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define the given dimensionless coefficients and the pump characteristic. The power coefficient is $C_p = \\frac{P}{\\rho \\omega^3 D^5}$, and the flow coefficient is $\\Phi = \\frac{Q}{\\omega D^3}$. The pump's operating characteristic is given as $C_p = a \\Phi^2$, where $a$ is a constant.",
        "Step 2: Substitute the definition of the flow coefficient ($\\Phi$) into the pump characteristic equation: $\\frac{P}{\\rho \\omega^3 D^5} = a \\left(\\frac{Q}{\\omega D^3}\\right)^2$.",
        "Step 3: Simplify the right-hand side and rearrange the equation to solve for power $P$: $\\frac{P}{\\rho \\omega^3 D^5} = a \\frac{Q^2}{\\omega^2 D^6}$. This simplifies to $P = a \\rho \\omega^3 D^5 \\frac{Q^2}{\\omega^2 D^6} = \\frac{a \\rho Q^2}{D} \\omega$.",
        "Step 4: Identify the proportionality of power. Since the flow rate $Q$, fluid density $\\rho$, length scale $D$, and constant $a$ are all constant, the derived relationship shows that power $P$ is directly proportional to the rotation rate $\\omega$ ($P \\propto \\omega$).",
        "Step 5: Apply the given change in rotation rate. Let the initial rotation rate be $\\omega_1 = \\omega$ and the initial power be $P_1$. The new rotation rate is $\\omega_2 = 1.25\\omega_1$. Since $P \\propto \\omega$, the ratio of the new power $P_2$ to the initial power $P_1$ is $P_2/P_1 = \\omega_2/\\omega_1$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the factor $\\alpha$. Substituting the new rotation rate, we get $P_2/P_1 = (1.25\\omega_1)/\\omega_1 = 1.25$. Therefore, the new power is $P_2 = 1.25 P_1$. The problem states the new power is $\\alpha P$, so $\\alpha = 1.25$.",
