      "reasoning": "The problem requires identifying the minimum number of additional squares to be colored black to ensure symmetry about two given lines: PQ (vertical) and MN (diagonal). We start with the three initially black squares and iteratively apply the symmetry conditions for both lines.\n\nLet's denote squares by (row, column) where row 1 is the top row and column 1 is the leftmost column.\n\n**Initial black squares:**\n1.  (1,3) - Top row, 3rd column\n2.  (2,1) - 2nd row, 1st column\n3.  (4,3) - Bottom row, 3rd column\n\n**Line of Symmetry PQ:** This is a vertical line passing between column 2 and column 3. For a square at (r, c), its mirror image across PQ is at (r, 5-c).\n\n**Applying PQ symmetry to initial squares:**\n*   For (1,3): its mirror image is (1, 5-3) = (1,2). This square must be black. (1 new square)\n*   For (2,1): its mirror image is (2, 5-1) = (2,4). This square must be black. (1 new square)\n*   For (4,3): its mirror image is (4, 5-3) = (4,2). This square must be black. (1 new square)\n\n**Current set of black squares (after PQ symmetry):**\n{(1,3), (2,1), (4,3), (1,2), (2,4), (4,2)} (Total 6 squares)\n\n**Line of Symmetry MN:** This is a diagonal line passing from the bottom-left corner (4,1) to the top-right corner (1,4). The reflection rule for a square at (r, c) across MN is (5-c, 5-r).\n\n**Applying MN symmetry to the current set of 6 black squares:**\n*   For (1,3): its mirror image is (5-3, 5-1) = (2,4). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (2,1): its mirror image is (5-1, 5-2) = (4,3). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (4,3): its mirror image is (5-3, 5-4) = (2,1). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (1,2): its mirror image is (5-2, 5-1) = (3,4). This square must be black. (1 new square)\n*   For (2,4): its mirror image is (5-4, 5-2) = (1,3). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (4,2): its mirror image is (5-2, 5-4) = (3,1). This square must be black. (1 new square)\n\n**Current set of black squares (after MN symmetry):**\n{(1,3), (2,1), (4,3), (1,2), (2,4), (4,2), (3,4), (3,1)} (Total 8 squares)\n\n**Re-checking PQ symmetry for the newly added squares (3,4) and (3,1):**\n*   For (3,4): its mirror image across PQ is (3, 5-4) = (3,1). This square is already in the set.\n*   For (3,1): its mirror image across PQ is (3, 5-1) = (3,4). This square is already in the set.\n\nAll squares now satisfy both symmetry conditions. The final configuration has 8 black squares.\n\n**Minimum number of squares that must be coloured black (additional):**\nTotal black squares = 8\nInitial black squares = 3\nAdditional squares = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional squares to be colored black is 5."

        "description": "Instead of formal coordinate rules, students can visually identify mirror images by folding the paper (mentally or physically) along the lines of symmetry. Start with one black square, find its reflections across both lines, then find reflections of those new squares, and so on, until the pattern is complete.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Intuitive for some students, less prone to coordinate calculation errors. Cons: Can be less systematic, prone to missing squares if the pattern gets complex, harder to verify completeness without a systematic approach.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for simpler grids or as a quick check after a formal calculation. Not recommended for complex patterns or if precision is critical."

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Systematic and guarantees minimality; scales to more complex symmetry groups. Cons: Requires some abstraction and careful bookkeeping.",
