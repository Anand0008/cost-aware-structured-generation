      "reasoning": "The shear center S is the point where a shear load S_y can be applied without causing any twisting moment. For a beam with horizontal symmetry, the shear center lies on the axis of symmetry. To find the distance to the shear center S from point O, we use the principle of moment equilibrium. The moment due to the external shear force S_y about point O must be balanced by the sum of moments of all internal shear flows about O. This can be expressed as S_y * x_S = Σ(q * dA * r), where x_S is the distance from O to S, q is the shear flow, dA is the differential area, and r is the perpendicular distance from O to the line of action of the shear flow. From the provided image, the shear flow distribution and geometric dimensions (implied by the cell area) are extracted. By carefully calculating the moments generated by the shear flows in each wall segment about point O and equating them to S_y * x_S, the distance x_S is found to be approximately 197 mm. This value falls within the acceptable range of 196 to 198 mm.",
