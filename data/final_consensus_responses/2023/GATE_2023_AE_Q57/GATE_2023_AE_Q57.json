The given source strengths are \\(\\pi/2\\), \\(-\\pi/3\\), \\(\\pi/4\\), and \\(-\\pi/5\\). Let the strength of the additional source be \\(Q_5\\). The condition is: \\(\\pi/2 - \\pi/3 + \\pi/4 - \\pi/5 + Q_5 = 0\\). Summing the known strengths: \\(\\pi(1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5) = \\pi(30/60 - 20/60 + 15/60 - 12/60) = \\pi(13/60)\\). Therefore, \\(Q_5 = -\\pi(13/60)\\). Calculating the numerical value: \\(Q_5 \\approx -3.14159 \\times (13/60) \\approx -0.680677\\). Rounding to two decimal places, \\(Q_5 \\approx -0.68\\)."

        "description": "Instead of directly recalling the formula, one can integrate the velocity field over a control volume enclosing the body. Applying the incompressible continuity equation, the net volume flux through this contour must be zero for a steady flow without accumulation. Each source/sink contributes its strength to this flux, leading to the conclusion that the algebraic sum of all source strengths must be zero for a closed body.",

      "Mathematics": "Superposition of solutions to Laplace's equation is a classic application of linear partial differential equations. Vector calculus (gradient, divergence, curl) is essential for understanding velocity potential and stream functions, and complex analysis is often used for 2D potential flow problems.",
