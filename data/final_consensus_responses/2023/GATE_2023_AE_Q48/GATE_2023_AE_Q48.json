      "reasoning": "The question asks for the ratio of the exact maximum shear stress ($\\tau$) to the maximum shear stress obtained using the thin-wall approximation ($\\tau_{thin-wall}$) for a hollow circular shaft. Given the ratio of inner diameter to outer diameter $k = D_i / D_o = 0.5$. The thickness is $t = R_o - R_i$.\n\n1.  **Exact Maximum Shear Stress ($\\tau$):**\n    The exact maximum shear stress in a hollow circular shaft under torsion is given by:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{T R_o}{J}$ where $J = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R_o^4 - R_i^4)$.\n    Substituting $R_i = k R_o$ and $J = \\frac{\\pi}{2} R_o^4 (1 - k^4)$:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{T R_o}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} R_o^4 (1 - k^4)} = \\frac{2 T}{\\pi R_o^3 (1 - k^4)}$\n    Since $R_o = D_o/2$, $R_o^3 = D_o^3/8$. So,\n    $\\tau = \\frac{2 T}{\\pi (D_o^3/8) (1 - k^4)} = \\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - k^4)}$\n\n2.  **Thin-Wall Approximation Shear Stress ($\\tau_{thin-wall}$):**\n    The thin-wall approximation (Bredt's formula) for shear stress is:\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 A_m t}$\n    Where:\n    *   $A_m$ is the mean enclosed area.\n    *   $t$ is the wall thickness.\n\n    Express $A_m$ and $t$ in terms of $R_o$ and $k$:\n    *   Outer radius $R_o$\n    *   Inner radius $R_i = k R_o$\n    *   Thickness $t = R_o - R_i = R_o(1-k)$\n    *   Mean radius $r_m = \\frac{R_o + R_i}{2} = \\frac{R_o + k R_o}{2} = R_o \\frac{(1+k)}{2}$\n    *   Mean enclosed area $A_m = \\pi r_m^2 = \\pi \\left(R_o \\frac{(1+k)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi R_o^2 \\frac{(1+k)^2}{4}$\n\n    Substitute these into the thin-wall formula:\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{T}{2 \\left[\\pi R_o^2 \\frac{(1+k)^2}{4}\\right] [R_o(1-k)]} = \\frac{T}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} R_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}$\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi R_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}$\n    Since $R_o = D_o/2$, $R_o^3 = D_o^3/8$. So,\n    $\\tau_{thin-wall} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi (D_o^3/8) (1+k)^2 (1-k)} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Stresses ($\\tau / \\tau_{thin-wall}$):**\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{\\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1 - k^4)}}{\\frac{16 T}{\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k)}}$\n    Cancel common terms ($16 T / (\\pi D_o^3)$):\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{(1+k)^2 (1-k)}{(1 - k^4)}$\n    Using the identity $1 - k^4 = (1 - k^2)(1 + k^2) = (1 - k)(1 + k)(1 + k^2)$:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{(1+k)^2 (1-k)}{(1 - k)(1 + k)(1 + k^2)}$\n    Cancel $(1-k)$ and one $(1+k)$ term:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{1+k}{1+k^2}$\n\n    Substitute the given $k = 0.5$:\n    $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{thin-wall}} = \\frac{1 + 0.5}{1 + (0.5)^2} = \\frac{1.5}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{1.5}{1.25} = 1.2$\n\n    The calculated ratio is 1.2."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define variables and the given ratio. Let outer diameter $D_o$, inner diameter $D_i$. The given ratio of inner to outer diameter is $k = D_i/D_o = 0.5$. This implies outer radius $r_o = D_o/2$ and inner radius $r_i = D_i/2 = k r_o$. The wall thickness is $t = r_o - r_i = r_o(1-k)$.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the exact maximum shear stress for a hollow circular shaft. Using the torsion formula, $\\tau_{max\\_exact} = (T r_o)/J$, where $J = (\\pi/32)(D_o^4 - D_i^4) = (\\pi/32) D_o^4 (1-k^4)$. Substituting $r_o = D_o/2$, the exact maximum shear stress is $\\tau_{max\\_exact} = (16 T D_o) / (\\pi (D_o^4 - D_i^4)) = (16 T) / (\\pi D_o^3 (1-k^4))$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the shear stress using the thin-wall approximation (Bredt's formula). For a thin-walled closed tube, $\\tau_{thin-wall} = T / (2 A_m t)$, where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line. For a circular tube, the median radius is $r_m = (r_o + r_i)/2 = r_o (1+k)/2$. Thus, $A_m = \\pi r_m^2 = \\pi r_o^2 (1+k)^2 / 4$. With thickness $t = r_o (1-k)$, the thin-wall shear stress becomes $\\tau_{thin-wall} = T / (2 \\cdot [\\pi r_o^2 (1+k)^2/4] \\cdot [r_o (1-k)]) = (2 T) / (\\pi r_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k))$. Since $r_o = D_o/2$, this simplifies to $\\tau_{thin-wall} = (16 T) / (\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k))$.",
        "Step 4: Compute the ratio $R = \\tau_{max\\_exact} / \\tau_{thin-wall}$. Substitute the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3: $R = \\frac{(16 T)/(\\pi D_o^3 (1-k^4))}{(16 T)/(\\pi D_o^3 (1+k)^2 (1-k))} = \\frac{(1+k)^2 (1-k)}{(1-k^4)}$. Simplify the expression using the identity $1-k^4 = (1-k)(1+k)(1+k^2)$, which yields $R = \\frac{(1+k)}{(1+k^2)}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given ratio $k = 0.5$ into the simplified ratio formula: $R = (1+0.5) / (1+0.5^2) = 1.5 / (1+0.25) = 1.5 / 1.25 = 1.2$.",
        "Step 6: The calculated ratio of the maximum shear stress in the hollow shaft to the thin-wall approximation is 1.2. Rounding to one decimal place, the answer is 1.2.",
