This speed is the 'corner velocity' (V*), where the aircraft simultaneously achieves its maximum permissible load factor (structural limit) and its maximum lift coefficient (aerodynamic stall limit). The formula for corner velocity is derived from the lift equation under maximum conditions: $n_{max} W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^{*2} S C_{L,max}$. Solving for $V^*$ yields $V^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 n_{max} (W/S)}{\\rho C_{L,max}}}$. Plugging in the given values ($n_{max}=7$, $W/S=6500 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $\\rho=1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, $C_{L,max}=2$) gives $V^* \\approx 192.3 \\text{ m/s}$, which rounds to 192 m/s.

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. The highest possible turn rate in a vertical plane (pull-up maneuver) occurs when the aircraft operates at both its maximum allowable load factor ($n_{max}$) and its maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L,max}$) simultaneously. This condition defines the corner velocity ($V^*$). Then, identify the given information: maximum permissible load factor ($n_{max} = 7$), maximum lift coefficient ($C_{L_{max}} = 2$), wing loading ($W/S = 6500$ N/m²), and air density ($\\rho = 1.23$ kg/m³).",
        "Step 2: Recall the lift equation and load factor definition. The lift ($L$) equals the load factor times weight: $L = nW$. At the limiting condition for maximum turn rate, $n = n_{max}$ and $C_L = C_{L,max}$. The aerodynamic lift equation is $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_{L,max}$.",
        "Step 3: Equate the two expressions for lift at the corner condition: $n_{max} W = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^{*2} S C_{L,max}$.",
        "Step 4: Solve for the corner velocity $V^*$. Rearranging the equation from Step 3 gives: $V^{*2} = \\frac{2 n_{max} W}{\\rho S C_{L,max}}$. This can be written in terms of wing loading as $V^{*2} = \\frac{2 n_{max} (W/S)}{\\rho C_{L,max}}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the given values into the formula for $V^{*2}$: $n_{max} = 7$, $W/S = 6500 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $\\rho = 1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, and $C_{L,max} = 2$.",
        "Step 6: Perform the calculation for $V^{*2}$: $V^{*2} = \\frac{2 \\times 7 \\times 6500}{1.23 \\times 2} = \\frac{91000}{2.46} \\approx 36991.87 \\text{ (m/s)}^2$.",
        "Step 7: Take the square root to find $V^*$: $V^* = \\sqrt{36991.87} \\approx 192.33 \\text{ m/s}$.",
