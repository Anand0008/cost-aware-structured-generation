      "reasoning": "The burnout velocity for a rocket in vacuum without gravity is given by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: $V = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln(m_0/m_f)$. Given identical specific impulse $I_{sp}$ and initial mass $m_0 = 5600$ kg for both missiles, the ratio $V_A/V_B$ depends only on the mass ratios. For missile A: propellant mass $m_{pA} = \\dot{m}_A t_A = 120 \\times 30 = 3600$ kg, so final mass $m_{fA} = 5600 - 3600 = 2000$ kg, mass ratio $m_0/m_{fA} = 5600/2000 = 2.8$. For missile B: $m_{pB} = 70 \\times 70 = 4900$ kg, $m_{fB} = 5600 - 4900 = 700$ kg, mass ratio $m_0/m_{fB} = 5600/700 = 8$. Then $V_A/V_B = \\ln(2.8) / \\ln(8) \\approx 1.0296 / 2.0794 \\approx 0.495 \\approx 0.5$. Hence $V_A = 0.5 V_B$, matching option C."

        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. Neglecting gravity and aerodynamic forces, the final velocity (burnout velocity) of a rocket is given by the ideal rocket equation: $V = g_0 I_{sp} \\ln(m_0/m_f)$.",
        "Step 2: Compute the propellant mass for each missile. For A: $m_{pA} = \\dot{m}_A \\times t_A = 120 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 30 \\text{ s} = 3600 \\text{ kg}$. For B: $m_{pB} = \\dot{m}_B \\times t_B = 70 \\text{ kg/s} \\times 70 \\text{ s} = 4900 \\text{ kg}$.",
        "Step 3: Compute the final mass (after burnout). Both start with $m_0 = 5600$ kg. $m_{fA} = m_0 - m_{pA} = 5600 - 3600 = 2000$ kg. $m_{fB} = m_0 - m_{pB} = 5600 - 4900 = 700$ kg.",
        "Step 4: Compute the mass ratios. For A: $m_0/m_{fA} = 5600/2000 = 2.8$. For B: $m_0/m_{fB} = 5600/700 = 8$.",
        "Step 5: Apply the rocket equation. Since $I_{sp}$ and $g_0$ are identical for both, the ratio of velocities is $V_A/V_B = \\ln(m_0/m_{fA}) / \\ln(m_0/m_{fB}) = \\ln(2.8) / \\ln(8)$. Calculate the numerical value of the ratio: $V_A/V_B \\approx 1.0296 / 2.0794 \\approx 0.495 \\approx 0.5$. Therefore, $V_A = 0.5 V_B$.",
        "Numerically evaluate: $\\ln(2.8) \\approx 1.0296$, $\\ln(8) \\approx 2.0794$. The ratio $V_A/V_B \\approx 1.0296/2.0794 \\approx 0.495 \\approx 0.5$. Thus $V_A = 0.5 V_B$, which matches option C.",
