In a statement, the World Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms that focus on economic stabilisation and tackle the root causes of its crisis. The latter has starved it of foreign exchange and led to shortages of food, fuel, and medicines. The bank is repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages of essential items such as medicine, cooking gas, fertiliser, meals for children, and cash for vulnerable households.\nBased only on the above passage, which one of the following statements can be inferred with certainty?",

      "reasoning": "The question asks to infer a statement with certainty 'based only on the above passage'. We must strictly adhere to the information provided in the text.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that it does not have enough foreign exchange.**\n    *   The passage states: 'The latter [referring to 'the root causes of its crisis'] has starved it of foreign exchange and led to shortages...'. This indicates that the foreign exchange shortage is a *consequence* or *effect* of the root causes, not the root cause itself. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n*   **B. The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.**\n    *   The passage states: 'In a statement, the World Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms that focus on economic stabilisation and tackle the root causes of its crisis.' While the World Bank identifies what Sri Lanka needs to do, it does not state that it *will advise* the government on *how* to tackle these causes. It only states the necessity for Sri Lanka to act. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n*   **C. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.**\n    *   The passage explicitly states: 'The World Bank has declared that it does not plan to offer new financing to Sri Lanka... until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place.' The phrase 'until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place' directly implies that, at the current time, such a framework is *not* in place. This statement can be inferred with certainty.\n*   **D. The World Bank has stated that it will provide Sri Lanka with additional funds for essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines.**\n    *   The passage states: 'The bank is repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages of essential items...'. 'Repurposing resources under existing loans' means reallocating funds from already approved loans, not providing *additional* new funds. Therefore, this statement cannot be inferred with certainty.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option C can be inferred with certainty from the given passage."

      "question_nature": "Application (Reading Comprehension and Logical Inference)",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Read the question carefully, noting the instruction 'Based only on the above passage, which one of the following statements can be inferred with certainty?'. This emphasizes that no outside knowledge should be used, and inferences must be direct and undeniable from the text.",
        "Step 2: Read the provided passage thoroughly to understand the main points and specific statements made by the World Bank.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Option A: 'According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that it does not have enough foreign exchange.' The passage states the crisis 'has starved it of foreign exchange' but does not state this is the 'root cause'. The root causes are mentioned generically but not specified. Therefore, this cannot be inferred with certainty.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Option B: 'The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.' The passage states Sri Lanka 'needed to adopt structural reforms' but does not say the World Bank will advise on how to do so. This is an unwarranted assumption.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Option C: 'According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.' The passage states the World Bank will not offer new financing 'until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place.' The use of 'until' strongly implies the framework is currently not adequate. This can be inferred with certainty.",
        "Step 6: Evaluate Option D: 'The World Bank has stated that it will provide Sri Lanka with additional funds for essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines.' The passage says the bank is 'repurposing resources under existing loans' to help with shortages. This is not 'additional funds'; it is reallocation of existing commitments. Thus, this statement is false.",
        "Step 7: Conclude that Option C is the only statement that can be inferred with certainty based solely on the passage.",
