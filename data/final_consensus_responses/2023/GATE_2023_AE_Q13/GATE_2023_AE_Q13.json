This is a first-order linear PDE, also known as the advection or transport equation. We can solve this using the method of characteristics.\n\n1.  **Identify the form:** The equation is of the form $A \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + B \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = C$, where $A=1$, $B=1$, and $C=0$.\n2.  **Characteristic Equations:** The characteristic equations are given by $\\frac{dx}{A} = \\frac{dt}{B} = \\frac{du}{C}$. Substituting the coefficients: $\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{du}{0}$.\n3.  **Solve for the characteristics:**\n    *   From $\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dt}{1}$, we get $dx = dt$. Integrating both sides yields $x - t = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. These are the characteristic curves.\n    *   From $\\frac{du}{0}$, we get $du = 0$. This implies that $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves. Therefore, $u$ must be a function of $C_1$.\n4.  **General Solution:** The general solution is $u(x, t) = f(x - t)$, where $f$ is an arbitrary differentiable function.\n5.  **Apply Initial Condition:** We are given the initial condition $u(x, 0) = e^{{-x^2}}$. Substitute $t=0$ into the general solution: $u(x, 0) = f(x - 0) = f(x)$. Comparing this with the given initial condition, we find $f(x) = e^{{-x^2}}$.\n6.  **Substitute back to find the specific solution:** Replace $f(x)$ in the general solution with $e^{{-x^2}}$, but with its argument $(x-t)$ instead of $x$. So, $u(x, t) = e^{{-(x-t)^2}}$.\n7.  **Evaluate at $t=1$:** We need the solution at $t=1$. $u(x, 1) = e^{{-(x-1)^2}}$.\n\nThis matches option A."
