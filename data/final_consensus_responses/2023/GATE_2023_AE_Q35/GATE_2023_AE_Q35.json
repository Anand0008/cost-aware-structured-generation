      "reasoning": "The problem defines the overall efficiency ($\\eta_o$) as the ratio of propulsive power to the total heat release in the combustor.\n1.  Overall efficiency: $\\eta_o = \\frac{\\text{Propulsive Power}}{\\text{Heat Release Rate}}$\n2.  Propulsive power is given by $F V_0$, where $F$ is the thrust and $V_0$ is the vehicle velocity.\n3.  Total heat release rate in the combustor is given by $\\dot{m}_f H_c$, where $\\dot{m}_f$ is the fuel mass flow rate and $H_c$ is the heat of combustion.\n    Therefore, the overall efficiency can be written as: $$\\eta_o = \\frac{F V_0}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$$\n4.  The specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is defined as the thrust per unit weight flow rate of fuel: $$I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m}_f g_0}$$ where $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n5.  From the specific impulse definition, we can express thrust as $F = I_{sp} \\dot{m}_f g_0$.\n6.  Substitute this expression for $F$ into the overall efficiency equation:\n    $$\\eta_o = \\frac{(I_{sp} \\dot{m}_f g_0) V_0}{\\dot{m}_f H_c}$$\n7.  The fuel mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $$\\eta_o = \\frac{I_{sp} g_0 V_0}{H_c}$$\n8.  Rearrange the equation to solve for specific impulse ($I_{sp}$):\n    $$I_{sp} = \\frac{\\eta_o H_c}{g_0 V_0}$$\n9.  Plug in the given values:\n    $V_0 = 1000$ m/s\n    $H_c = 120$ MJ/kg $= 120 \\times 10^6$ J/kg\n    $\\eta_o = 40\\% = 0.40$\n    $g_0 = 10$ m/s$^2$\n    $$I_{sp} = \\frac{0.40 \\times (120 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/kg})}{10 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\times 1000 \\text{ m/s}} = \\frac{0.40 \\times 120 \\times 10^6}{10^4} = 0.40 \\times 120 \\times 10^2 = 4800 \\text{ seconds}$$\nThe calculated value of 4800 seconds is the correct answer."
