      "reasoning": "The problem states that stagnation enthalpy is constant between Stations 1 (freestream, denoted by subscript $\\infty$) and 3 (combustor entry). For a calorically perfect gas, the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) is constant. Stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is related to stagnation temperature ($T_0$) by $h_0 = c_p T_0$. Therefore, if $h_0$ is constant and $c_p$ is constant, then $T_0$ must also be constant between Stations 1 and 3, i.e., $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$.\n\nThe stagnation temperature relation for a calorically perfect gas is given by:\n$T_0 = T \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \\right)$\n\nApplying this relation at Station $\\infty$ (freestream):\n$T_{0,\\infty} = T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right)$ (Equation 1)\n\nApplying this relation at Station 3:\n$T_{0,3} = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$ (Equation 2)\n\nSince $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$, we can equate Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n$T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$\n\nNow, we need to solve for $M_3$. Divide both sides by $T_3$:\n$\\frac{T_\\infty}{T_3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2$\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n$\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 = \\frac{T_\\infty}{T_3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) - 1$\n\nMultiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1}$:\n$M_3^2 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1} \\left[ \\frac{T_\\infty}{T_3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) - 1 \\right]$\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find $M_3$:\n$M_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1} \\left[ \\frac{T_\\infty}{T_3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) - 1 \\right]}$\n\nThis derived expression matches Option B."

        "Identify the governing principle: Stagnation enthalpy ($h_0$) is constant between Station 1 (freestream, denoted by subscript $\\infty$) and Station 3 (combustor entry). For a calorically perfect gas, constant stagnation enthalpy implies constant stagnation temperature ($T_0$). Therefore, $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$.",
        "Recall the stagnation-static temperature relation for a calorically perfect gas: $T_0 = T\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2\\right)$. Apply this relation to both the freestream (Station $\\infty$) and the combustor inlet (Station 3) and equate them: $T_\\infty \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_\\infty^2\\right) = T_3 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_3^2\\right)$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the standard isentropic relation for stagnation temperature. The relationship between static temperature ($T$), stagnation temperature ($T_0$), and Mach number ($M$) for a calorically perfect gas is $T_0 = T \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \\right)$.",
        "Step 3: Apply this relation to the freestream (Station $\\infty$): $T_{0,\\infty} = T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right)$.",
        "Step 4: Apply the stagnation temperature relation at the combustor entry (Station 3): $T_{0,3} = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$.",
        "Step 5: Equate the stagnation temperatures. Since the flow through the intake and isolator is adiabatic and there is no work done, the stagnation enthalpy (and thus stagnation temperature for a calorically perfect gas) remains constant: $T_{0,\\infty} = T_{0,3}$. Therefore, $T_\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) = T_3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_3^2 \\right)$.",
        "Step 6: Rearrange the equation to solve for $M_3$. Isolate $M_3$ through algebraic manipulation: first divide by $T_3$, then subtract 1, and finally multiply by $\\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1}$ and take the square root. This yields $M_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1} \\left[ \\frac{T_\\infty}{T_3} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_\\infty^2 \\right) - 1 \\right]}$.",
