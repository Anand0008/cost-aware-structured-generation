      "reasoning": "The question describes a perfect gas exhausting through a convergent duct at choked conditions. This means the Mach number at the nozzle exit (throat) is M=1. We need to analyze how increasing the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) affects the exit velocity (u), Mach number (M), pressure (p), temperature (T), and density ($\\rho$), assuming the reservoir temperature ($T_0$) remains constant.\n\n1.  **Mach number (M):** Since the nozzle is already operating at choked conditions, the flow at the exit is sonic (M=1). For a convergent nozzle, the Mach number distribution is fixed once choking occurs and is independent of the reservoir pressure $P_0$ (as long as $P_0$ is high enough to maintain choking). Thus, **M remains the same** (M=1).\n\n2.  **Temperature (T):** For isentropic flow at the choked exit (M=1), the static temperature ($T$) is related to the stagnation temperature ($T_0$) by the isentropic relation: $T = T_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)$. Since the reservoir temperature ($T_0$) is stated as constant and $\\gamma$ (specific heat ratio) is constant for a perfect gas, the static temperature $T$ at the exit **remains the same**.\n\n3.  **Velocity (u):** The velocity at the choked exit is the speed of sound, $u = a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$. Since $\\gamma$, $R$ (gas constant), and $T$ (static temperature at exit) all remain the same, the exit velocity $u$ also **remains the same**.\n\n4.  **Pressure (p):** For isentropic flow at the choked exit (M=1), the static pressure ($p$) is related to the stagnation pressure ($P_0$) by the isentropic relation: $p = P_0 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$. Since the reservoir pressure ($P_0$) is increased and the term $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}$ is a constant (the critical pressure ratio), the static pressure $p$ at the exit **increases** proportionally with $P_0$.\n\n5.  **Density ($\\rho$):** Using the ideal gas law, $p = \\rho R T$, we can write $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}$. Since $p$ increases and $T$ remains the same (and $R$ is constant), the density $\\rho$ at the exit **increases**.\n\nTherefore, u, M, and T remain the same, while p and $\\rho$ increase. This matches option C."

        "Identify that the convergent nozzle is operating at choked conditions. This means the Mach number at the exit (which is the throat for a convergent nozzle) is M=1. The initial reservoir pressure (P₀) and temperature (T₀) are given.",
        "Since the nozzle is already choked (M=1 at the exit), increasing the reservoir pressure (P₀) will not change the Mach number at the exit. The flow cannot accelerate beyond sonic speed in a convergent nozzle, so M remains constant. Also, note that the reservoir temperature (T₀) remains unchanged.",
        "Analyze the effect on static temperature (T). For isentropic flow at M=1, the static temperature T is related to the stagnation temperature T₀ by a constant ratio: T = T₀ \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right). Since T₀ is constant and \\gamma is constant, the static temperature T at the exit remains constant.",
        "Analyze the effect on velocity (u). At choked conditions, the exit velocity is the speed of sound, u = a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}. Since the static temperature T (from the previous step), \\gamma, and R are all constant, the exit velocity u remains constant.",

For isentropic flow at the choked exit, the static pressure (p) is related to the stagnation pressure (P₀) by the critical pressure ratio: p = P₀ \\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}}. Since P₀ is increased and the critical pressure ratio is a constant, the static pressure p at the exit must increase proportionally with P₀.",
        "Analyze the effect on density (\\rho). Using the ideal gas law, \\rho = \\frac{p}{R T}. Since the static pressure p increases (from the previous step) and the static temperature T remains constant, the density \\rho at the exit must increase.",
