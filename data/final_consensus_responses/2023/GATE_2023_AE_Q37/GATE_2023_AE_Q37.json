      "reasoning": "The problem describes a supersonic intake ramp where an oblique shock originates from the leading edge 'O' and must meet the 'COWL LIP'. This geometric constraint implies that the shock angle, \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\), relative to the incoming flow, remains constant regardless of changes in flight Mach number \\(M\\) or ramp angle \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\). The angle \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) is determined by the fixed geometry of the cowl lip relative to point O. The ramp angle \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) is the flow deflection angle across the shock.\n\nWe analyze each option based on the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation for oblique shocks:\n\n*   **Option A: 'It is always possible to find a ramp setting \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) such that the shock still meets the cowl lip (\\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) remains the same).**'\n    *   If the shock must meet the cowl lip, \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) is geometrically fixed. The \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relation states that for a given \\(\\beta\\) and \\(M\\), there is a corresponding \\(\\theta\\). As \\(M\\) increases, the maximum possible deflection angle (\\(\\theta_{max}\\)) for an attached oblique shock also increases. This means that for a fixed \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) (which is greater than the Mach angle \\(\\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\)), as \\(M\\) increases, the required \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) to produce that \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) will decrease. Since \\(\\theta_{max}\\) increases with \\(M\\), it becomes *more* likely, not less, that a valid \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) can be found. Therefore, it is always possible to adjust \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) to maintain the fixed \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) as long as \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) is a physically possible shock angle (i.e., \\(\\beta_{SHOCK} > \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\) and \\(\\theta_{RAMP} < \\theta_{max}\\)). This statement is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: 'If \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) is held fixed, the shock angle \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) will increase.'**\n    *   From the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) relationship (or the \\(\\theta-\\beta-M\\) diagram), for a fixed flow deflection angle \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\), as the upstream Mach number \\(M\\) increases, the shock wave angle \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) *decreases* (the shock becomes weaker and flatter). Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 'If \\(M\\) exceeds a critical value, it would NOT be possible to find a ramp setting \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) such that the shock still meets the cowl lip (\\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) remains the same).**'\n    *   As explained for Option A, as \\(M\\) increases, the maximum deflection angle \\(\\theta_{max}\\) for an attached shock increases. This means that for a fixed \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) (dictated by geometry), it becomes *easier* to find a corresponding \\(\\theta_{RAMP}\\) that is less than \\(\\theta_{max}\\). There is no 'critical value' of \\(M\\) beyond which it becomes impossible; rather, the operating envelope expands. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 'Shock angle \\(\\beta_{SHOCK} < \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\)'**\n    *   The term \\(\\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\) represents the Mach angle, \\(\\mu\\). For an oblique shock wave to exist, its angle \\(\\beta_{SHOCK}\\) must always be greater than the Mach angle, i.e., \\(\\beta_{SHOCK} > \\mu = \\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\). If \\(\\beta_{SHOCK} = \\mu\\), it's a Mach wave, not a shock. If \\(\\beta_{SHOCK} < \\mu\\), it's physically impossible for an attached oblique shock. Therefore, this statement is incorrect."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the physical setup. The diagram shows a supersonic intake with a rotatable ramp. An oblique shock originates from the ramp's leading edge and is designed to meet the cowl lip. This geometric constraint means the shock angle \\beta_{SHOCK} (relative to the freestream flow) is fixed by the intake's physical dimensions (line from O to the cowl lip).",
        "Recall the fundamental \\theta-\\beta-M relationship for oblique shocks. This relationship connects the upstream Mach number (M), the shock wave angle (\\beta), and the flow deflection angle (\\theta). The equation is \\tan\\theta = 2 \\cot\\beta \\frac{M^2 \\sin^2\\beta - 1}{M^2 (\\gamma + \\cos 2\\beta) + 2}.",
        "Analyze Option A: The cowl lip position fixes the desired shock angle \\beta_{SHOCK}. As the upstream Mach number M changes, the \\theta-\\beta-M relation implies that the required flow deflection angle \\theta_{RAMP} must be adjusted to maintain this fixed \\beta_{SHOCK}. Since for any supersonic M, a corresponding \\theta can be found (as long as M > 1/\\sin(\\beta_{SHOCK}) and \\theta \\le \\theta_{max}(M)), it is always possible to adjust the ramp angle \\theta_{RAMP} to keep the shock on the cowl lip.",
        "Evaluate Option B: If the ramp angle \\theta_{RAMP} is fixed, and the upstream Mach number M increases, the \\theta-\\beta-M relationship dictates that the shock angle \\beta_{SHOCK} will decrease (the shock becomes more inclined to the flow). Therefore, statement B, which claims \\beta_{SHOCK} increases, is incorrect.",
        "Evaluate Option C: For any supersonic Mach number M, an attached oblique shock solution exists as long as the required flow deflection angle \\theta_{RAMP} is less than or equal to the maximum deflection angle \\theta_{max}(M). As M increases, \\theta_{max}(M) also increases, expanding the operating envelope for attached shocks. Therefore, it does not become impossible to find a \\theta_{RAMP} to keep the shock on the cowl lip; rather, it remains possible. Statement C is incorrect.",
        "Evaluate Option D: For an attached oblique shock to exist, the normal component of the upstream Mach number must be supersonic, i.e., M_n = M \\sin\\beta > 1. This implies \\sin\\beta > 1/M, or \\beta > \\sin^{-1}(1/M). Therefore, statement D, which suggests \\beta_{SHOCK} < \\sin^{-1}(1/M), is incorrect.",
