      "reasoning": "The question states that the function y = f(x) is both monotonic and continuous, and it has exactly one root in the open interval x₁ < x < x₂. \n\n1.  **Continuity:** A continuous function allows for the application of the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A monotonic function is either always increasing or always decreasing. This property is crucial because it ensures that if the function crosses the x-axis, it can do so only once.\n3.  **Exactly one root in (x₁, x₂):** This means there is a unique value c such that x₁ < c < x₂ and f(c) = 0.\n\nAccording to the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)**, if a function f(x) is continuous on a closed interval [x₁, x₂] and f(x₁) and f(x₂) have opposite signs, then there must exist at least one root c in the open interval (x₁, x₂) such that f(c) = 0. The condition for opposite signs is mathematically expressed as f(x₁)f(x₂) < 0.\n\nThe additional condition of **monotonicity** ensures that if the function changes sign (i.e., crosses the x-axis), it can only do so once. If f(x₁) and f(x₂) had the same sign, a monotonic function would never cross the x-axis within the interval, thus having no root. If f(x₁) or f(x₂) were zero, the root would be at the boundary, not strictly *within* the open interval (x₁, x₂).\n\nTherefore, for a continuous and monotonic function to have exactly one root in the open interval (x₁, x₂), it is necessary that f(x₁) and f(x₂) have opposite signs, which means their product must be negative: f(x₁)f(x₂) < 0."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",

        "Step 1: Understand the given conditions. The function y = f(x) is monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) and continuous on the interval x₁ < x < x₂. It is also stated that there is exactly one root in this open interval.",
        "Step 2: Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) and monotonicity. For a continuous function to have a root in an interval, the Intermediate Value Theorem states that the function values at the endpoints must have opposite signs (i.e., f(x₁)f(x₂) < 0). The additional condition of monotonicity ensures that if the function crosses the x-axis (changes sign), it can do so only once, thus guaranteeing exactly one root within the interval.",
        "Step 3: Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). For a continuous function f(x) on an interval [x_1, x_2], if f(x_1) and f(x_2) have opposite signs (i.e., f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0), then there exists at least one root c in (x_1, x_2). This condition is necessary for a root to exist within the interval.",
        "Step 4: Consider the monotonicity condition. The problem states that there is 'only one root' in the interval. For a continuous and monotonic function, if it changes sign over an interval, it can cross the x-axis exactly once. This property, combined with the IVT, guarantees the uniqueness of the root. Therefore, for a single root to exist, the function values at the endpoints, f(x_1) and f(x_2), must have opposite signs, which means their product f(x_1)f(x_2) must be negative.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate the given options. Based on the Intermediate Value Theorem and the property of monotonic functions, for a unique root to exist strictly within (x_1, x_2), the function values at the endpoints must have opposite signs. This means f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0. Let's check the options:\n    *   A. f(x_1)f(x_2) > 0: Implies same sign, no root for monotonic function.\n    *   B. f(x_1)f(x_2) = 0: Implies root at an endpoint, not strictly within (x_1, x_2).\n    *   C. f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0: Implies opposite signs, guaranteeing exactly one root in (x_1, x_2) for a continuous and monotonic function.\n    *   D. f(x_1) - f(x_2) = 0: Implies f(x_1) = f(x_2). If non-zero, no root. If zero, root at endpoints.",
        "Step 6: Therefore, option C, f(x_1)f(x_2) < 0, is the correct condition for a continuous and monotonic function to have only one root in the open interval (x_1, x_2)."
