The objective is to find the total thrust required $T$.",
        "Step 2: Recall the force balance equation for steady, unaccelerated climbing flight. Along the flight path, the thrust $T$ must balance the drag $D$ and the component of weight along the flight path $W\\sin\\theta$. Thus, $T = D + W\\sin\\theta$.",

        "Step 4: Calculate the total drag force $D$. The drag force is given by $D = q S C_D$. Substitute the calculated dynamic pressure, wing area, and drag coefficient: $D = 3500 \\, \\text{N/m}^2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 0.026 = 1820 \\, \\text{N}$.",

Calculate $\\sin(0.1 \\, \\text{radians}) \\approx 0.0998334$. So, $W\\sin\\theta = 8000 \\, \\text{N} \\times 0.0998334 \\approx 798.667 \\, \\text{N}$.",
