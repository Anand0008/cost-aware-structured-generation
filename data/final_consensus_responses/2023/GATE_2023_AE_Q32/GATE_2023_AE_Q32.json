        "description": "D'Alembert's principle converts a dynamic problem into an equivalent static problem by introducing an inertial force ($m a_x$) acting opposite to the acceleration. For horizontal equilibrium, the horizontal component of tension would balance this inertial force: $T \\cos(\\alpha) - m a_x = 0$. This allows solving for $a_x = (T \\cos(\\alpha))/m$, and subsequently the load factor $n_x = a_x/g$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Can be conceptually easier for some students by treating acceleration as a 'force', making it intuitive for static equilibrium thinkers. Provides an alternative perspective. Cons: Requires careful attention to the direction of the inertial force; involves an extra step of defining the inertial force. No significant computational advantage for this problem.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful when visualizing equilibrium of forces in an accelerating frame, or for problems involving moments or more complex dynamic systems where converting to a pseudo-static problem simplifies analysis."
