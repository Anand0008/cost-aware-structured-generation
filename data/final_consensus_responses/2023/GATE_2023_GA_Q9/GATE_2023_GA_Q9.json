Then, we multiply their coefficients ($a_i b_j$) and sum all such products.\n\n    The possible combinations of powers $(i, j)$ that sum to 4 are:\n    *   **$i=3, j=1$**: (Coefficient of $x^3$ in $P_1$) $\\times$ (Coefficient of $x^1$ in $P_2$)\n        $(1) \\times (12) = 12$\n    *   **$i=2, j=2$**: (Coefficient of $x^2$ in $P_1$) $\\times$ (Coefficient of $x^2$ in $P_2$)\n        $(-3) \\times (-6) = 18$\n    *   **$i=1, j=3$**: (Coefficient of $x^1$ in $P_1$) $\\times$ (Coefficient of $x^3$ in $P_2$)\n        $(3) \\times (1) = 3$\n\n4.  **Sum the products:**\n    The total coefficient of $x^4$ is the sum of these products: $12 + 18 + 3 = 33$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^4$ is 33."
