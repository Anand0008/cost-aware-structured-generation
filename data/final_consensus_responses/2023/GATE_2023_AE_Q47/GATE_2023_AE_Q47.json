      "reasoning": "The elastic flexural buckling load of a column is primarily governed by Euler's buckling formula, which in its general form is given by $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}$, where $P_{cr}$ is the critical buckling load, $E$ is the Young's Modulus of the material, $I$ is the minimum moment of inertia of the cross-section, $L$ is the actual length of the column, and $K$ is the effective length factor which depends on the boundary conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A. The buckling load increases with increase in flexural rigidity of the column.** Flexural rigidity is defined as $EI$. From the formula, $P_{cr}$ is directly proportional to $EI$. Therefore, an increase in flexural rigidity leads to an increase in the buckling load. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **B. The buckling load increases with increase in the length of the column.** From the formula, $P_{cr}$ is inversely proportional to the square of the effective length $(KL)^2$. Thus, an increase in the actual length $L$ (assuming $K$ is constant) will decrease the buckling load. This statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **C. The boundary conditions of the column affect the buckling load.** The boundary conditions determine the effective length factor $K$. Different boundary conditions (e.g., pin-pin, fixed-free, fixed-pin, fixed-fixed) result in different values of $K$, which directly influences the effective length $KL$ and, consequently, the buckling load $P_{cr}$. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **D. The buckling load is NOT directly dependent on the density of the material used for the column.** The Euler buckling formula $P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}$ includes Young's Modulus ($E$), Moment of Inertia ($I$), and length ($L$), but not the density ($\\rho$) of the material. While density might be relevant for self-weight or dynamic analysis, it does not directly appear in the elastic flexural buckling load calculation. This statement is **correct**."
