      "reasoning": "The Kutta condition is a fundamental physical principle in potential flow theory for airfoils. It states that for a body with a sharp trailing edge, the flow must leave the trailing edge smoothly, preventing infinite velocities or pressure discontinuities. This condition is crucial for obtaining a unique and physically realistic value for the circulation around the airfoil, which in turn determines the lift.\n\n1.  **Eliminate Sources (A & B):** Sources (or sinks) add or remove fluid from the flow field. They are used to model phenomena like jet engines or porous bodies, but they do not directly contribute to satisfying the Kutta condition at a sharp trailing edge by smoothing the flow. The Kutta condition is fundamentally about adjusting the circulation.\n2.  **Role of Circulation (C & D):** The Kutta condition is satisfied by adding a specific amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) to the potential flow solution. This circulation effectively shifts the stagnation points such that one stagnation point is precisely located at the trailing edge, forcing the flow to leave smoothly.\n3.  **Direction of Circulation:** The question refers to a 'streamline pattern as shown in the figure'. Since the figure is not provided, we infer the required circulation from the correct answer, D. For a typical airfoil at a positive angle of attack, without the Kutta condition, the potential flow would tend to wrap around the trailing edge unphysically. To smooth this out and bring the stagnation point to the trailing edge, a specific circulation is added. Given that the correct answer is D, it implies that the initial potential flow solution shown in the (missing) figure is one that requires the addition of a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) to satisfy the Kutta condition and achieve a smooth flow departure at the trailing edge. This aligns with the standard convention where counter-clockwise circulation is positive, and clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) generates upward lift for an airfoil in a typical left-to-right flow."

        "Understand the Kutta condition: For a lifting airfoil with a sharp trailing edge, the flow must leave smoothly, preventing infinite velocities or pressure discontinuities. This implies equal velocities on the upper and lower surfaces at the trailing edge.",
        "Recognize the role of circulation: In potential flow theory, the solution for flow around an airfoil is non-unique without the Kutta condition. The Kutta condition ensures a unique and physically realistic value for the circulation, which is essential for calculating lift and ensures the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly by forcing the rear stagnation point to coincide with it.",
        "Evaluate the role of sources/sinks: Sources and sinks represent the addition or removal of fluid and change the net mass flux. They do not create net circulation around the body and are not the mechanism used to smooth the flow at a sharp trailing edge or to determine circulation in the context of the Kutta condition. Therefore, options involving sources/sinks are incorrect.",
        "Evaluate the role of circulation: In potential flow theory, the Kutta condition is satisfied by superimposing a specific amount of circulation ($\\Gamma$) onto the non-circulatory flow. Adding a vortex (circulation) changes the tangential velocity distribution around the airfoil, adjusting the flow field such that the stagnation point is forced to the trailing edge, ensuring a smooth departure of streamlines.",
        "Determine the direction of circulation: The Kutta condition requires the rear stagnation point to coincide with the trailing edge. For a typical airfoil at a positive angle of attack, generating upward lift, the Kutta-Joukowski theorem ($L' = \\rho U_{\\infty} \\Gamma$) implies that for a standard counter-clockwise positive circulation convention, upward lift requires negative circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$), which is clockwise. This clockwise circulation adjusts the flow to ensure smooth departure at the trailing edge.",
        "Conclude that the Kutta condition is satisfied by adding circulation. For the given scenario (implied by the question's context and typical airfoil behavior), the addition of a clockwise circulation ($\\Gamma < 0$) is the required condition to achieve smooth flow departure and generate lift."

Then, determine the sign of circulation by recalling that positive lift (upward) for left-to-right flow typically requires clockwise circulation (Γ < 0).",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, first eliminate options involving sources/sinks as they don't enforce the Kutta condition. Then, choose the circulation option that best aligns with the Kutta condition and the observed flow pattern. For a typical lifting airfoil with left-to-right freestream, clockwise circulation (negative Γ if counter-clockwise is positive) is associated with positive (upward) lift.",
