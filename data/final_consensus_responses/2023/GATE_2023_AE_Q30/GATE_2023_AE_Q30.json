      "reasoning": "The number of degrees of freedom (DOF) for a system is the minimum number of independent coordinates required to completely specify its position and orientation. The idealized wing is treated as a rigid body. In the plane of the diagram, a rigid body typically has three degrees of freedom (horizontal translation, vertical translation, and rotation). However, the given model specifies support using a linear spring and a torsional spring:\n\n1.  **Linear Spring (k):** This spring allows for translational motion of the wing in the vertical direction (often referred to as heave or plunge motion). This constitutes one independent degree of freedom.\n2.  **Torsional Spring (k_\\theta):** This spring allows for rotational motion of the wing (often referred to as pitching motion). This constitutes a second independent degree of freedom.\n\nThe setup implies that horizontal translation is either neglected or constrained by the specific support conditions of the springs, which is common in idealized wing vibration models for studying bending and torsion. Since these two motions (vertical translation and rotation) are independent of each other, the total number of degrees of freedom for this idealized wing vibration model is the sum of these independent motions, which is $1 + 1 = 2$."
