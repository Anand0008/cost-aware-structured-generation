      "reasoning": "The sentence 'You are delaying the completion of the task. Send _______ contributions at the earliest.' requires a possessive adjective to modify the noun 'contributions'.\n\n- Option A, 'you are', is a subject pronoun followed by a verb. It does not fit grammatically before a noun to show possession.\n- Option B, 'your', is a possessive adjective. It correctly indicates that the 'contributions' belong to 'you'. This fits the context perfectly.\n- Option C, 'you’re', is a contraction of 'you are'. Similar to 'you are', it is not a possessive adjective and does not fit before 'contributions'.\n- Option D, 'yore', is a noun referring to a long time past (e.g., 'days of yore'). It is completely out of context and grammatically incorrect here.\n\nTherefore, 'your' is the only grammatically correct and contextually appropriate option."

        "Step 2: Determine the grammatical role required for the blank. Since 'contributions' is a noun, the blank needs a word that modifies it, specifically a possessive adjective or possessive pronoun, to indicate ownership or relation to 'you'.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate the incorrect options. Options A ('you are') and C ('you're', a contraction of 'you are') are a subject pronoun and verb, not a possessive modifier. Option D ('yore') is an archaic word meaning 'a long time past' and is semantically incorrect.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate the correct option. Option B, 'your', is a possessive adjective/pronoun that correctly modifies 'contributions' to indicate ownership or association, fitting the grammatical requirement.",
        "Step 5: Conclude that 'your' (Option B) is the only word that correctly fulfills the grammatical role of a possessive adjective and makes the sentence meaningful.",
