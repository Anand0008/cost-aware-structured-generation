These are constant for a given flow condition.\n\nSubstitute the expression for $Re_x$ into the formula for $\\theta$:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{{0.664x}}{{\\sqrt{{\\frac{{\\rho_\\infty U_e x}}{{\\mu_\\infty}}}}}}$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$\\theta = 0.664x \\left( \\frac{{\\mu_\\infty}}{{\\rho_\\infty U_e x}} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n$\\theta = 0.664x \\frac{{\\sqrt{{\\mu_\\infty}}}}{{\\sqrt{{\\rho_\\infty U_e}} \\sqrt{x}}}$\n\nCombine the terms involving $x$:\n\n$\\theta = \\left( 0.664 \\frac{{\\sqrt{{\\mu_\\infty}}}}{{\\sqrt{{\\rho_\\infty U_e}}}} \\right) x^{1 - 1/2}$\n\n$\\theta = \\left( 0.664 \\frac{{\\sqrt{{\\mu_\\infty}}}}{{\\sqrt{{\\rho_\\infty U_e}}}} \\right) x^{1/2}$\n\nSince the term in the parenthesis is a constant for a given flow, we can conclude that:\n\n$\\theta \\propto x^{1/2}$\n\nThis matches option B."

        "name": "Integral Momentum Equation (Karman-Pohlhausen Method) / Integral Boundary Layer Approach",
        "description": "This method involves applying the integral form of the momentum equation to the boundary layer, often assuming a velocity profile (e.g., polynomial or sinusoidal). By integrating the momentum equation across the boundary layer, one can derive an ordinary differential equation for the boundary layer thickness, which for a flat plate, also leads to an $x^{1/2}$ dependence, though with an approximate constant compared to the exact Blasius solution.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More general, applicable to flows with pressure gradients or complex geometries where exact solutions are unavailable. Cons: Requires assuming a velocity profile, introducing approximations. The Blasius solution is exact for a flat plate, while the integral approach is less rigorous and can be more mathematically sophisticated.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for obtaining approximate solutions in situations where the exact Blasius solution is not applicable (e.g., non-zero pressure gradients, different boundary conditions), for a quicker, less rigorous analysis, or when studying theory in depth for conceptual understanding."

      "Fluid Mechanics": "Boundary layer theory, including the Blasius solution, is a cornerstone of viscous fluid mechanics, directly derived from simplified Navier-Stokes equations. It connects to concepts like viscosity, shear stress, and flow regimes (laminar/turbulent). The $x^{1/2}$ scaling is analogous to diffusion processes where characteristic length scales grow with the square root of time.",
      "Aerodynamics": "Boundary layer theory is crucial for understanding and predicting aerodynamic drag (especially skin friction drag) on aircraft components like wings and fuselage. It influences airfoil design, high-lift systems, and overall aircraft performance, and is essential for optimizing aerodynamic designs.",
      "Heat Transfer": "The Reynolds analogy establishes a connection between momentum and heat transfer in boundary layers, allowing for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients from known skin friction coefficients, and vice-versa. This is relevant in thermal management of aircraft and engines.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "Accurate drag estimation from boundary layer theory feeds into performance calculations such as range, endurance, and climb performance.",
      "Mathematics": "Similarity solutions of PDEs and dimensional analysis are mathematical tools that lead to the Blasius equation and the observed scaling laws."
