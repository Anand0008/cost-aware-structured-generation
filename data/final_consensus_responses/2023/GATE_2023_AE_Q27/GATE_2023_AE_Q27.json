      "reasoning": "Based on the principles of aircraft structural design, statements B, C, and D accurately describe the functions of ribs in a semi-monocoque wing construction, while statement A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Statement A: For a rectangular planform wing, the dimensions of the ribs DO NOT depend on their spanwise position in the wing.** This statement is FALSE. Even for a rectangular planform, the internal loads (bending moments, shear forces, torsional loads) vary significantly along the wing span. Ribs are also designed to accommodate concentrated loads from components like engines, landing gear, and fuel tanks, which are located at specific spanwise positions. Consequently, the dimensions, material thickness, and internal structure of ribs must vary along the span to efficiently carry these varying loads and fulfill specific local requirements.\n\n*   **Statement B: Ribs increase the column buckling stress of longitudinal stiffeners connected to them.** This statement is TRUE. Ribs act as intermediate supports for longitudinal stiffeners (stringers). By providing these supports, ribs reduce the unsupported or 'effective' length of the stiffeners. According to Euler's critical buckling load formula, reducing the effective length (KL) significantly increases the critical buckling load, and thus the buckling stress, that a stiffener can withstand.\n\n*   **Statement C: Ribs increase plate buckling stress of the skin panels.** This statement is TRUE. Ribs, in conjunction with longitudinal stiffeners, subdivide the larger wing skin panels into smaller, more stable units. Smaller plate panels have a higher critical buckling stress compared to larger unsupported panels. This subdivision effectively increases the overall plate buckling resistance of the wing skin.\n\n*   **Statement D: Ribs help in maintaining aerodynamic shape of the wing.** This statement is TRUE. One of the fundamental functions of ribs is to define and maintain the precise airfoil contour of the wing. This accurate shape is crucial for achieving the desired aerodynamic performance, including efficient lift generation and minimized drag."

        "Understand the role of ribs in semi-monocoque construction. Ribs are transverse structural members in a wing, perpendicular to spars, that maintain airfoil shape, transfer loads from skin to spars, and support stiffeners/stringers. They are part of a system (skin, spars, stiffeners, ribs) that collectively carries loads.",
        "Evaluate statement A: 'For a rectangular planform wing, the dimensions of the ribs DO NOT depend on their spanwise position.' This statement is false. Even for a rectangular planform, internal loads (bending, shear, torsion) and local requirements (e.g., engine mounts, landing gear bays, fuel tanks) vary significantly along the span. Therefore, rib dimensions (e.g., height, thickness, cut-outs, reinforcements) must vary with spanwise position to accommodate these changing loads and requirements.",
        "Evaluate statement B: 'Ribs increase the column buckling stress of longitudinal stiffeners connected to them.' This statement is true. Ribs provide intermediate support to longitudinal stiffeners, effectively reducing their unsupported length. According to Euler's column buckling theory, reducing the effective length of a column significantly increases its critical buckling load and stress.",
        "Evaluate statement C: 'Ribs increase plate buckling stress of the skin panels.' This statement is true. Ribs, along with stiffeners, subdivide large skin panels into smaller ones. Smaller panels have a higher critical plate buckling stress, thereby enhancing the buckling resistance of the wing skin.",
        "Evaluate statement D: 'Ribs help in maintaining aerodynamic shape of the wing.' This statement is true. A primary function of ribs is to define and preserve the precise airfoil contour of the wing at each station, which is crucial for aerodynamic efficiency.",

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Provides detailed insights into rib performance, high accuracy for complex geometries. Cons: Computationally intensive, requires specialized software/expertise, and not feasible for hand calculations.",

Trace how these loads must flow from skin to internal members. This naturally reveals that ribs must transfer loads, support stiffeners, and maintain shape, helping you judge each option logically.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Deepens understanding and reduces rote memorization. Cons: Slightly slower than direct recall if you are already well-memorized.",
