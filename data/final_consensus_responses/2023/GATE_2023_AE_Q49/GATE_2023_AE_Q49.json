      "reasoning": "The problem involves a rigid bar pinned at one end and supported by an inclined deformable rod, subjected to a uniformly distributed load. The solution requires a sequence of steps:\n1.  **Convert the Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) to an equivalent concentrated force:** The UDL of 100 N/m acts over the entire 2m length of bar AB. The total equivalent concentrated force is $F_{UDL} = 100 \\text{ N/m} \\times 2 \\text{ m} = 200 \\text{ N}$. This force acts at the centroid of the UDL, which is at the midpoint of AB, precisely at point D (1m from A).\n2.  **Determine the geometry of rod CD:** Point A is the origin (0,0). Point D is at (1m, 0). Point C is at (0, -1m). The length of rod CD is $L_{CD} = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\text{ m}$. The angle the rod CD makes with the vertical (and horizontal) is $45^\\circ$.\n3.  **Apply static equilibrium to the rigid bar AB:** The bar is pinned at A. Taking moments about A ($\\sum M_A = 0$):\n    The equivalent UDL creates a clockwise moment: $M_{UDL} = 200 \\text{ N} \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 200 \\text{ N m}$.\n    The force in rod CD ($F_{CD}$) acts at point D. Its vertical component ($F_{CD_y}$) creates a counter-clockwise moment about A. Since the bar is rigid and pinned at A, the rod CD must be in tension to counteract the downward load.\n    $F_{CD_y} \\times 1 \\text{ m} - 200 \\text{ N m} = 0$\n    $F_{CD_y} = 200 \\text{ N}$.\n    Since the rod CD makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the vertical, $F_{CD_y} = F_{CD} \\cos(45^\\circ)$.\n    Therefore, $F_{CD} \\cos(45^\\circ) = 200 \\text{ N}$.\n    $F_{CD} = \\frac{200}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{200}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}$. This is the tensile force in rod CD.\n4.  **Calculate the elongation of rod CD:** The axial stiffness of rod CD is $k_{CD} = 40 \\text{ N/mm}$.\n    The elongation $\\delta_{CD} = \\frac{F_{CD}}{k_{CD}} = \\frac{200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}}{40 \\text{ N/mm}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm}$.\n5.  **Relate the elongation of rod CD to the vertical deflection at D (Compatibility):** Since the rigid bar is pinned at A, it rotates about A. The elongation $\\delta_{CD}$ of the rod is the component of the vertical displacement of D along the line of the rod. If $\\delta_{D_{vertical}}$ is the vertical deflection at D, and the rod makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the vertical, then:\n    $\\delta_{CD} = \\delta_{D_{vertical}} \\cos(45^\\circ)$\n    Therefore, $\\delta_{D_{vertical}} = \\frac{\\delta_{CD}}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm}}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n6.  **Round off to the nearest integer:** The vertical deflection at point D is 10 mm."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify Geometry and Loads: The rigid bar AB is 2 m long, pinned at A. Point D is at midspan (1 m from A). The uniformly distributed load (UDL) is 100 N/m acting upwards over the entire 2 m length of AB. Rod CD connects point D to point C, where C is 1 m below A on the wall. The rod CD has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ m and makes an angle of 45 degrees with the vertical. The axial stiffness of rod CD is $k = 40$ N/mm.",
        "Convert UDL to Equivalent Concentrated Load: The total upward force due to the UDL is $100 \\text{ N/m} \\times 2 \\text{ m} = 200 \\text{ N}$. This resultant force acts at the centroid of the UDL, which is at the midspan, point D (1 m from A).",
        "Draw Free Body Diagram (FBD) and Apply Equilibrium: Consider the rigid bar AB, pinned at A. Take moments about point A ($\\sum M_A = 0$). The upward UDL resultant (200 N) creates a counter-clockwise moment about A: $200 \\text{ N} \\times 1 \\text{ m}$. Let $T$ be the axial force in rod CD. Resolve $T$ into vertical ($T_v$) and horizontal ($T_h$) components at D. Since the rod is at 45 degrees, $T_v = T \\sin 45^\\circ$ and $T_h = T \\cos 45^\\circ$. The vertical component $T_v$ creates a clockwise moment about A: $T_v \\times 1 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Equilibrium equation: $200 \\text{ N} \\times 1 \\text{ m} - T_v \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 0$. Therefore, $T_v = 200 \\text{ N}$. Calculate the axial force $T$: $T = T_v / \\sin 45^\\circ = 200 \\text{ N} / (1/\\sqrt{2}) = 200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}$.",
        "Calculate Axial Deformation of Rod CD: The axial deformation (elongation) of rod CD, $\\delta_L$, is given by $\\delta_L = T/k$. $\\delta_L = (200\\sqrt{2} \\text{ N}) / (40 \\text{ N/mm}) = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm}$.",
        "Apply Geometric Compatibility: For a small rotation $\\theta$ of the rigid bar AB about A, the vertical deflection at D, $v_D$, is approximately $v_D = \\theta \\times (\\text{distance AD}) = \\theta \\times 1 \\text{ m}$. The elongation of the rod CD, $\\delta_L$, is related to the vertical deflection at D by considering the component of $v_D$ along the rod's axis: $\\delta_L = v_D \\cos 45^\\circ$.",
        "Solve for Vertical Deflection at D: Substitute $\\delta_L$ from the previous step into the compatibility equation: $5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm} = v_D \\cos 45^\\circ = v_D \\times (1/\\sqrt{2})$. $v_D = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ mm} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 5 \\times 2 \\text{ mm} = 10 \\text{ mm}$.
