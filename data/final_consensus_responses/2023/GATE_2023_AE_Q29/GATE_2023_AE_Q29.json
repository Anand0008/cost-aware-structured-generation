      "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement A: The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix equals the sum of the elements of the principal diagonal.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The sum of the eigenvalues of a square matrix is equal to its trace. The trace of a square matrix is defined as the sum of the elements on its main (principal) diagonal. This is a fundamental property of eigenvalues and matrices.\n\n**Statement B: If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then \\(1/\\lambda\\) is always an eigenvalue of its transpose (A^T).**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. A square matrix \\(A\\) and its transpose \\(A^T\\) have the exact same eigenvalues. This means if \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of A, then \\(\\lambda\\) is also an eigenvalue of \\(A^T\\). It does not mean \\(1/\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A^T\\). The property that if \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of A, then \\(1/\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A^{-1}\\) (if A is invertible) is distinct from this statement.\n\n**Statement C: If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of an orthogonal matrix A, then \\(1/\\lambda\\) is also an eigenvalue of A.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. An orthogonal matrix A is a square matrix such that \\(A A^T = A^T A = I\\), which implies \\(A^{-1} = A^T\\). If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of A, then \\(A x = \\lambda x\\) for some non-zero eigenvector \\(x\\). A known property is that if \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of A, then \\(1/\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A^{-1}\\) (provided A is invertible, which orthogonal matrices always are). Since \\(A^{-1} = A^T\\), it means \\(1/\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A^T\\). Furthermore, a matrix A and its transpose \\(A^T\\) have the exact same eigenvalues. Therefore, if \\(1/\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A^T\\), it must also be an eigenvalue of A.\n\n**Statement D: If a matrix has n distinct eigenvalues, it also has n independent eigenvectors.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. If an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) has \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues, then \\(A\\) is diagonalizable. A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has \\(n\\) linearly independent eigenvectors. Therefore, having \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues guarantees \\(n\\) linearly independent eigenvectors.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of true statements is A, C, and D."

        "Step 3: Evaluate Statement B: Recall the relationship between eigenvalues of a matrix A and its transpose A^T. A and A^T have the same eigenvalues. Therefore, if \\lambda is an eigenvalue of A, then \\lambda is also an eigenvalue of A^T, not 1/\\lambda. Thus, Statement B is false.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Statement C: For an orthogonal matrix A, we know A^{-1} = A^T. If \\lambda is an eigenvalue of A, then 1/\\lambda is an eigenvalue of A^{-1}. Since A^{-1} = A^T, 1/\\lambda is an eigenvalue of A^T. Furthermore, A and A^T have the same eigenvalues. Therefore, 1/\\lambda is also an eigenvalue of A. Additionally, for an orthogonal matrix, the eigenvalues satisfy |\\lambda|=1, which implies 1/\\lambda = \\bar{\\lambda} (conjugate of \\lambda). Since complex eigenvalues of real matrices come in conjugate pairs, 1/\\lambda (which is \\bar{\\lambda}) is also an eigenvalue of A. Thus, Statement C is true.",
        "Step 5: Evaluate Statement D: If an n \\times n matrix has n distinct eigenvalues, then the corresponding eigenvectors are linearly independent. This implies the matrix has n linearly independent eigenvectors. Thus, Statement D is true.",
