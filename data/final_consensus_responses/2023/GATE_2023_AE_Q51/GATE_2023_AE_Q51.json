      "reasoning": "The amplitude of an underdamped free vibration decays exponentially with time. For an initial displacement $X_0$ and zero initial velocity, the amplitude envelope is given by $X(t) = X_0 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t}$. The damped period is $T_d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_d}$, where $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$. After exactly $n$ complete damped cycles, the time elapsed is $t = nT_d$. The ratio of amplitudes after $n$ cycles, $X_n$, to the initial amplitude $X_0$ can be expressed as $\\frac{X_n}{X_0} = e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n n T_d}$. Substituting $T_d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_d}$ and $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$, this simplifies to $\\frac{X_n}{X_0} = e^{-\\frac{2\\pi n \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}}$. The term $\\frac{2\\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$ is the logarithmic decrement, $\\delta$. Therefore, $\\frac{X_n}{X_0} = e^{-n\\delta}$.\n\nGiven:\nInitial displacement $X_0 = 10$ cm\nDamping ratio $\\zeta = 0.1$\nNumber of cycles $n = 2$\n\nFirst, calculate the logarithmic decrement $\\delta$:\n$\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi(0.1)}{\\sqrt{1-(0.1)^2}} = \\frac{0.2\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-0.01}} = \\frac{0.2\\pi}{\\sqrt{0.99}} \\approx \\frac{0.6283}{0.994987} \\approx 0.6314$\n\nNow, calculate the amplitude after two cycles ($X_2$):\n$\\frac{X_2}{X_0} = e^{-2\\delta} = e^{-2 \\times 0.6314} = e^{-1.2628} \\approx 0.2828$\n\n$X_2 = X_0 \\times 0.2828 = 10 \\text{ cm} \\times 0.2828 = 2.828 \\text{ cm}$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the amplitude of the displacement is $2.83$ cm. This value falls within the acceptable range of 2.80 to 2.86 cm."
