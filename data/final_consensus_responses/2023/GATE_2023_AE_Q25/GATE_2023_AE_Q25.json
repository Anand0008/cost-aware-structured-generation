      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statements regarding harmonically excited forced vibration of a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) linear spring-mass-damper system. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: The total response of the mass is a combination of free vibration transient and steady-state response.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The total response of a forced vibration system is the sum of the homogeneous solution (free vibration, transient) and the particular solution (forced vibration, steady-state). Mathematically, $x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t)$, where $x_c(t)$ is the complementary function (transient) and $x_p(t)$ is the particular integral (steady-state).\n\n**Option B: The free vibration transient dies out with time for each of the three possible conditions of damping (under-damped, critically damped, and over-damped).**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The transient response is characterized by an exponential decay term, $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$, which causes it to diminish over time. This exponential decay factor is present for all positive damping ratios ($\\zeta > 0$), which covers under-damped ($\\zeta < 1$), critically damped ($\\zeta = 1$), and over-damped ($\\zeta > 1$) conditions. In all these cases, as $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} \\to 0$, meaning the transient response dies out.\n\n**Option C: The steady-state periodic response is dependent on the initial conditions at the time of application of external forcing.**\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The steady-state response (particular integral) is solely dependent on the system parameters (mass, stiffness, damping) and the characteristics of the forcing function (amplitude, frequency). It is independent of the initial conditions (initial displacement and velocity). The initial conditions only affect the constants of integration in the transient response.\n\n**Option D: The rate of decay of free vibration transient response depends on the mass, spring stiffness and damping constant.**\nThis statement is **TRUE**. The rate of decay of the transient response is governed by the exponential term $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$. The decay constant is $\\zeta\\omega_n$. We know that the damping ratio $\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{mk}}$ and the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$. Therefore, the product $\\zeta\\omega_n = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{mk}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\frac{c}{2m}$. This shows that the rate of decay depends on the damping constant ($c$) and the mass ($m$). Since $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$ both depend on $m$, $k$, and $c$, the rate of decay is indeed a function of mass, spring stiffness, and damping constant.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements A, B, and D are true."

The total response $x(t)$ is the sum of the complementary (homogeneous) solution, $x_c(t)$, and the particular solution, $x_p(t)$.",

        "Step 3: Analyze Statement B. The transient response $x_c(t)$ contains an exponential decay term, $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t}$. For any positive damping (under-damped, critically damped, or over-damped, i.e., $\\zeta > 0$), this term ensures that the transient response dies out with time. This statement is true.",

For engines, large transient vibrations occur during startup/shutdown (e.g., passing critical speeds), which must decay quickly. Steady-state analysis ensures protection from continuous operational vibrations (e.g., due to unbalance). For sensitive instruments, isolators are designed to dampen launch transients and protect against continuous operational vibrations.",
