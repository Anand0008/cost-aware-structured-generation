Using the given densities: $\\rho_A = 1.01$ kg/m³, $\\rho_B = 0.82$ kg/m³, the ratio is $\\sqrt{0.82 / 1.01} = \\sqrt{0.81188} \\approx 0.9010 \\approx 0.90$ when rounded to two decimal places.

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle for airspeed measurement using a Pitot-static tube under the assumption of incompressible flow. This is Bernoulli's equation, which states that the dynamic pressure ($\\Delta p = p_0 - p$) is related to velocity ($V$) and fluid density ($\\rho$) by $\\Delta p = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$.",
        "Step 2: Rearrange this equation to solve for velocity: $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta p}{\\rho}}$.",
        "Step 3: Note that the problem states the differential pressure reading ($\\Delta p$) is the same for both airplanes: $\\Delta p = 3$ kPa = 3000 Pa.",
        "Step 4: Express the velocities for Airplane A and Airplane B using the derived formula: $V_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta p}{\\rho_A}}$ and $V_B = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta p}{\\rho_B}}$.",
        "Step 5: Form the ratio of the cruise speeds, $V_A / V_B$. Since $2 \\Delta p$ is common for both, it cancels out: $\\frac{V_A}{V_B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta p / \\rho_A}{2 \\Delta p / \\rho_B}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_B}{\\rho_A}}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given densities: $\\rho_A = 1.01$ kg/m³ and $\\rho_B = 0.82$ kg/m³. Calculate the ratio: $\\frac{V_A}{V_B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.82}{1.01}} = \\sqrt{0.81188} \\approx 0.9010$.",

      "Fluid Mechanics": "Bernoulli's equation is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics derived from conservation of energy for inviscid flow, and its application is central to the Pitot-static tube principle and the concept of dynamic pressure.",
      "Flight Mechanics": "Airspeed measurement is critical for aircraft performance, stability, and control. Indicated airspeed (IAS) and true airspeed (TAS) are key concepts, central to performance calculations such as stall speed, climb performance, and range, all of which depend on dynamic pressure and density.",
      "Instrumentation": "Pitot-static systems are a classic example of pressure-based velocity measurement in engineering instrumentation.",
      "Gas Dynamics": "At higher Mach numbers, compressibility effects modify the Pitot-static relations, requiring isentropic and normal shock relations instead of simple incompressible Bernoulli.",
      "Instrumentation and Control": "Pitot-static measurements feed into air data computers and autopilot systems, linking aerodynamics with avionics and control laws.",
      "Thermodynamics": "The concept of isentropic processes, derived from the principles of thermodynamics, is fundamental to understanding compressible flow Pitot tube measurements and true airspeed calculations, even if not directly used in incompressible flow problems."
