      "reasoning": "The critical Mach number ($M_{cr}$) is the freestream Mach number at which the local flow velocity at some point on the airfoil surface first reaches the speed of sound (local Mach number = 1). The drag divergence Mach number ($M_{dd}$) is the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient begins to rise sharply due to increasing wave drag and shock-induced boundary layer separation.\n\n1.  **$M_{cr} < M_{dd}$:** This relation is correct. $M_{cr}$ represents the initial onset of local supersonic flow, while $M_{dd}$ signifies a more advanced stage of compressibility effects where drag significantly increases. Thus, $M_{dd}$ always occurs at a higher freestream Mach number than $M_{cr}$.\n2.  **$M_{cr} < 1.0$:** This relation is correct. The critical Mach number is always less than 1.0 because it defines the point where local sonic flow first appears on an airfoil operating in a *subsonic* freestream. If the freestream itself were supersonic, the concept of $M_{cr}$ as the onset of local sonic flow in a subsonic freestream would not apply.\n3.  **$M_{dd} < 1.0$:** This relation is correct. The drag divergence Mach number also typically occurs below 1.0. It marks the onset of severe wave drag in the *transonic* regime, which is generally considered to be below a freestream Mach number of 1.0. While advanced airfoil designs aim to push $M_{dd}$ very close to 1.0, it remains a phenomenon of high-subsonic/transonic flow before the freestream becomes fully supersonic.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are correct. Option D ($M_{cr} > 1.0$) is incorrect as $M_{cr}$ is always less than 1.0."

        "The Drag Divergence Mach number ($M_{dd}$) is the freestream Mach number at which the drag coefficient begins to increase sharply and significantly due to the formation of strong shock waves and boundary layer separation as the region of supersonic flow expands on the airfoil.",
        "As the freestream Mach number increases, $M_{cr}$ is reached first when local sonic flow appears. A further increase in freestream Mach number leads to the formation of stronger shock waves and a rapid increase in drag, which defines $M_{dd}$. Therefore, $M_{cr}$ must always be less than $M_{dd}$ ($M_{cr} < M_{dd}$).",
        "By definition, $M_{cr}$ is the freestream Mach number where local sonic flow occurs, implying the freestream flow itself is still subsonic. Thus, $M_{cr}$ is always less than 1.0 ($M_{cr} < 1.0$).",
