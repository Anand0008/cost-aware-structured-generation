      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the altitude of a satellite in a circular orbit given its time period, Earth's radius, mass, and the universal gravitational constant. The core principle to solve this is Kepler's Third Law.\n\n1.  **Convert the orbital period (T) to seconds**: The given period is 90 minutes.\n    $T = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ s/minute} = 5400 \\text{ s}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Earth's gravitational parameter ($\\mu$)**: This is defined as the product of the universal gravitational constant (G) and the mass of the Earth ($M_E$).\n    $\\mu = G \\times M_E = (6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2) \\times (5.98 \\times 10^{24} \\text{ kg}) = 3.98866 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law for a circular orbit**: The formula relating orbital period (T) to orbital radius (a) and gravitational parameter ($\\mu$) is:\n    $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n    $a^3 = \\frac{T^2 \\mu}{4\\pi^2}$\n    $a = \\left( \\frac{T^2 \\mu}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Substitute the calculated values into the formula for $a$**: Ensure all units are consistent (meters and seconds).\n    $a = \\left( \\frac{(5400 \\text{ s})^2 \\times (3.98866 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}^2)}{4 \\times (3.14159)^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    This yields an orbital radius $a \\approx 6635.2 \\text{ km}$ from Earth's center.\n\n5.  **Calculate the altitude (h)**: Altitude is the orbital radius minus the Earth's radius.\n    $h = a - R_E = 6635.2 \\text{ km} - 6370 \\text{ km} = 265.2 \\text{ km}$.\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the altitude is 265 km. This value aligns with the expected range of 260 to 300 km."

Set equal and solve for r: \\sqrt{\\mu/r} = 2\\pi r / T \\implies \\mu/r = 4\\pi^2 r^2 / T^2 \\implies r^3 = (\\mu T^2)/(4\\pi^2), which is identical to Kepler's Law.",
