      "reasoning": "The correct answer is approximately 3.46 MPa (rounded to two decimal places). The solution involves calculating the principal stresses for a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel with end caps: hoop stress ($\\sigma_1 = Pr/t$), longitudinal stress ($\\sigma_2 = Pr/(2t)$), and negligible radial stress ($\\sigma_3 = 0$). These stresses are then substituted into the Von Mises yield criterion formula: $\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}[(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2]}$. After substitution and simplification, the equivalent stress becomes $\\sigma_e = \\frac{Pr}{t} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Equating this to the given yield strength ($\\sigma_y = 300 \\text{ MPa}$) and using the given ratio $r/t = 100$, the internal pressure $P$ is calculated as $P = \\frac{2 \\sigma_y}{r/t \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2 \\times 300}{100 \\times \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.4641 \\text{ MPa}$.

It explicitly includes the third principal stress (even if zero for plane stress) and can be used as an alternative to the simplified 2D plane stress form. For example, substituting `\\sigma_1=100P`, `\\sigma_2=50P`, `\\sigma_3=0` yields the same result as the 2D formula.",

For a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel, `\\sigma_{max}=\\sigma_h=100P` and `\\sigma_{min}=\\sigma_3=0`, so `\\tau_{max}=50P`. Setting `50P = \\sigma_y/2 = 300/2 = 150` implies `P=3.0 MPa`.",
