      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify all true statements regarding turbofan engines with afterburners.\n\n**Option A: Turning afterburner ON increases specific fuel consumption.**\nSpecific fuel consumption (SFC), also known as thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), is defined as the fuel flow rate per unit of thrust. Afterburners achieve thrust augmentation by injecting and burning additional fuel in the exhaust stream. This combustion is less efficient than in the main combustor, and while thrust increases significantly, the fuel consumption increases disproportionately, leading to a much higher SFC (often 3-5 times higher than dry operation). This is a well-known characteristic and a major drawback of afterburners.\nTherefore, statement A is TRUE.\n\n**Option B: Turbofan engines with afterburners have variable area nozzles.**\nWhen the afterburner is engaged, the exhaust gas temperature and volume flow rate increase dramatically due to the additional heat release. To efficiently expand these hotter, higher volume gases, maintain optimal engine operation (e.g., prevent compressor stall or choke), and achieve maximum thrust, the nozzle exit area must be increased. A fixed-area nozzle would lead to excessive back pressure and potential engine instability. Therefore, a variable area nozzle (VAN) is a mandatory component for afterburning engines, allowing the nozzle area to adjust to different operating conditions (afterburner ON/OFF).\nTherefore, statement B is TRUE.\n\n**Option C: Turning afterburner ON decreases specific fuel consumption.**\nThis statement directly contradicts statement A. As established, afterburners significantly increase SFC due to their high fuel consumption for the thrust produced.\nTherefore, statement C is FALSE.\n\n**Option D: Turning afterburner ON increases stagnation pressure across the engine.**\nThe afterburner is a combustion chamber located after the turbine. While it significantly increases the stagnation temperature (T₀), combustion processes inherently involve pressure losses due to friction, mixing, and heat addition. Therefore, the stagnation pressure typically decreases across the afterburner section. The primary goal of an afterburner is to increase exhaust velocity by increasing T₀, not P₀.\nTherefore, statement D is FALSE.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and B are true."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the function and purpose of an afterburner in a turbofan engine. An afterburner is a secondary combustion chamber that injects and burns additional fuel in the hot, oxygen-rich exhaust gases downstream of the turbine, providing a temporary thrust boost, often used in military aircraft.",
        "Step 2: Analyze the effect of afterburner operation on specific fuel consumption (SFC). SFC is defined as fuel flow rate per unit thrust (SFC = \\dot{m}_f / F). Afterburners are highly fuel-inefficient because combustion occurs at lower pressures in the exhaust duct, which is thermodynamically less efficient than the main combustor. The significant increase in fuel flow for the thrust produced leads to a substantial increase in SFC when the afterburner is ON.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate the necessity of a variable area nozzle. When the afterburner is active, the exhaust gas stagnation temperature (T_{0,e}) and volume flow rate increase substantially. To maintain the required mass flow and prevent excessive back pressure or compressor stall, the exhaust area must increase. This necessitates a variable area nozzle to efficiently expand the hotter, higher-volume gases.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the effect of afterburner operation on specific fuel consumption (SFC) again (Option C). Turning the afterburner ON *decreases* specific fuel consumption is false. As established in Step 2, afterburners are fuel-thirsty and significantly *increase* SFC, prioritizing thrust over efficiency.",
        "Step 5: Analyze the effect of afterburner operation on stagnation pressure across the engine (Option D). Turning the afterburner ON *increases* stagnation pressure across the engine is false. While stagnation temperature increases significantly, combustion in an afterburner is an irreversible process that typically results in a *decrease* in stagnation pressure due to friction, mixing, and heat addition. The afterburner does not increase the overall engine stagnation pressure; it primarily increases stagnation temperature."

Quickly recall the key characteristics of afterburners: significantly increased Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), mandatory variable area nozzle, and no increase in stagnation pressure. Use these principles to eliminate options that contradict them and identify the correct statements.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If unsure, recall that afterburners are designed for 'power at any cost' in military applications, implying high fuel consumption and the necessity of specialized components like variable area nozzles to handle extreme conditions. Focus on options that align with these critical concepts of high SFC and variable nozzle requirement.",
      "time_management": "Allocate 1-2 minutes. This is a conceptual question testing fundamental propulsion knowledge. Read each option carefully, apply known facts about afterburners (high SFC, variable nozzle, no stagnation pressure increase), and quickly eliminate incorrect choices. Do not overthink or get stuck on equations."

This would involve detailed thermodynamic analysis of the combustion process, flow through the variable area nozzle, and optimization of design parameters.",
