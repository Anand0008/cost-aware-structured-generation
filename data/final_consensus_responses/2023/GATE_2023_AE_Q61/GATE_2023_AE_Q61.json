      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the mass flow rate of methane using the equivalence ratio. First, the stoichiometric mass-based fuel-to-air ratio for methane combustion, $(F/A)_{stoich}$, must be determined. For methane (CH4), the balanced stoichiometric combustion equation is $\\text{CH}_4 + 2(\\text{O}_2 + 3.76\\text{N}_2) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7.52\\text{N}_2$. From this, the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio by mass is $(A/F)_{stoich} = \\frac{2 \\times (32 + 3.76 \\times 28)}{16} \\approx 17.255$. Therefore, $(F/A)_{stoich} = 1/(A/F)_{stoich} \\approx 1/17.255 \\approx 0.05795$. Given the equivalence ratio $\\phi = 0.5$ and the definition $\\phi = \\frac{(F/A)}{(F/A)_{stoich}}$, the actual fuel-to-air ratio is $(F/A) = \\phi \\times (F/A)_{stoich} = 0.5 \\times 0.05795 = 0.028975$. Finally, with the air flow rate $\\dot{m}_{air} = 20 \\text{ kg/s}$, the mass flow rate of methane is $\\dot{m}_f = (F/A) \\times \\dot{m}_{air} = 0.028975 \\times 20 = 0.5795 \\text{ kg/s}$. Rounding to two decimal places, the mass flow rate of methane is $0.58 \\text{ kg/s}$."

        "Identify the given parameters and define the equivalence ratio. Given: Equivalence ratio $\\phi = 0.5$, air mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{air} = 20 \\text{ kg/s}$. The fuel is methane (CH4). The equivalence ratio is defined as $\\phi = (F/A) / (F/A)_{stoich}$, where $(F/A)$ is the actual fuel-to-air mass ratio and $(F/A)_{stoich}$ is the stoichiometric fuel-to-air mass ratio.",
        "Determine the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio for methane (CH4). First, write the stoichiometric combustion equation for methane: $\\text{CH}_4 + 2(\\text{O}_2 + 3.76\\text{N}_2) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7.52\\text{N}_2$. Calculate the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio by mass, $(A/F)_{stoich}$. Moles of air = $2 \\times (1 + 3.76) = 9.52$ moles. Moles of methane = $1$ mole. Molecular weight of air $\\approx 28.97 \\text{ kg/kmol}$. Molecular weight of methane $\\approx 16.04 \\text{ kg/kmol}$. Therefore, $(A/F)_{stoich} = \\frac{9.52 \\times 28.97}{1 \\times 16.04} \\approx 17.195$. The stoichiometric fuel-air ratio is the reciprocal: $(F/A)_{stoich} = \\frac{1}{17.195} \\approx 0.058157$.",
        "Calculate the actual fuel-to-air ratio, $(F/A)_{actual}$. Using the definition of equivalence ratio, $(F/A)_{actual} = \\phi \\times (F/A)_{stoich}$. Substitute the given equivalence ratio and the calculated stoichiometric ratio: $(F/A)_{actual} = 0.5 \\times 0.058157 = 0.0290785$.",
        "Calculate the mass flow rate of methane, $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$. The actual fuel-to-air ratio is also defined as $(F/A)_{actual} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{fuel}}{\\dot{m}_{air}}$. Rearranging this equation to solve for $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$: $\\dot{m}_{fuel} = (F/A)_{actual} \\times \\dot{m}_{air}$.",

If you are unsure about the stoichiometric A/F for methane or the equivalence ratio definition, skip and return if time permits after easier questions.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If forced to guess, note that φ=0.5 is lean, so fuel flow is a small fraction of air flow (≈1-2%). An answer like 10 kg/s (50% of air flow) is impossible. Eliminate obviously large numbers. For a quick estimate, if $(A/F)_{stoich}$ is around 17 for hydrocarbons and $\\phi=0.5$, then $(F/A)_{actual}$ will be roughly $0.5/17 \\approx 0.03$. Multiply by air flow rate (20 kg/s) to get $0.03 \\times 20 = 0.6 \\text{ kg/s}$.",
