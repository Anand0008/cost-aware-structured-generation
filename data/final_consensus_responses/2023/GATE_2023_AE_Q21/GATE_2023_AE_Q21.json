      "reasoning": "The question defines a '50% reaction ideal axial flow compressor' and asks for the correct statement. The degree of reaction (R) in an axial compressor stage is defined as the ratio of the static enthalpy rise in the rotor to the static enthalpy rise in the entire stage. Mathematically, this is given by: $R = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$, where $h_1$ is the static enthalpy at the rotor inlet, $h_2$ is the static enthalpy at the rotor outlet, and $h_3$ is the static enthalpy at the stage outlet (stator outlet). For a 50% reaction stage, $R = 0.5$. Substituting this into the definition, we get $0.5 = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_3 - h_1}$, which implies $h_2 - h_1 = 0.5 \\times (h_3 - h_1)$. This means the static enthalpy rise across the rotor ($h_2 - h_1$) is 50% of the static enthalpy rise across the entire stage ($h_3 - h_1$). This directly matches option B.\n\nLet's analyze other options:\n*   **A. The stagnation enthalpy rise across the rotor is 50% of the rise across the stage.** In an ideal axial flow compressor, work is done only in the rotor, and the stator is adiabatic with no work done. Therefore, the stagnation enthalpy rise across the rotor is equal to the stagnation enthalpy rise across the entire stage. So, this statement is incorrect.\n*   **C. Axial velocity component of the flow at the rotor exit is 50% of that at the rotor entry.** For an ideal axial flow compressor, the axial velocity component is typically assumed to remain constant throughout the stage for simplicity in analysis, or at least not necessarily change by 50% due to 50% reaction. This statement is incorrect.\n*   **D. The static pressure rise across the rotor is 50% of the rise across the stator.** For a 50% reaction stage, the static enthalpy rise across the rotor is equal to the static enthalpy rise across the stator (as the total static enthalpy rise of the stage is split equally between rotor and stator). Since static pressure rise is directly related to static enthalpy rise for an ideal gas, the static pressure rise across the rotor would be approximately equal to the static pressure rise across the stator, not 50% of it. So, this statement is incorrect."
