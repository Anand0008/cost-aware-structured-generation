      "reasoning": "The given differential equation, $x^2 \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4x \\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0$, is a second-order homogeneous Cauchy-Euler (or equidimensional) equation. The standard approach is to assume a solution of the form $y = x^m$. Substituting $y = x^m$, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = m x^{m-1}$, and $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = m(m-1) x^{m-2}$ into the ODE yields the characteristic (or indicial) equation: $m(m-1) + 4m + 2 = 0$. This simplifies to $m^2 - m + 4m + 2 = 0 \\implies m^2 + 3m + 2 = 0$, which factors as $(m+1)(m+2) = 0$. The roots are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -2$. Therefore, the general solution is $y(x) = C_1 x^{-1} + C_2 x^{-2} = \\frac{C_1}{x} + \\frac{C_2}{x^2}$.\nNext, we apply the initial conditions. First, $y(1) = 0$: $0 = \\frac{C_1}{1} + \\frac{C_2}{1^2} \\implies C_1 + C_2 = 0$ (Equation 1).\nThen, we find the first derivative: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -C_1 x^{-2} - 2C_2 x^{-3} = -\\frac{C_1}{x^2} - \\frac{2C_2}{x^3}$. Applying the second initial condition, $\\frac{dy}{dx}(1) = 1$: $1 = -\\frac{C_1}{1^2} - \\frac{2C_2}{1^3} \\implies -C_1 - 2C_2 = 1$ (Equation 2).\nSolving the system of equations (1) and (2): From (1), $C_1 = -C_2$. Substituting into (2): $-(-C_2) - 2C_2 = 1 \\implies C_2 - 2C_2 = 1 \\implies -C_2 = 1 \\implies C_2 = -1$. Then, $C_1 = -(-1) = 1$.\nThe particular solution is $y(x) = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\nFinally, we evaluate $y$ at $x = 2$: $y(2) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$. Rounding to two decimal places, the value is $0.25$. This falls within the accepted range of 0.24 to 0.26."

        "Step 1: Identify the given differential equation as a second-order homogeneous Euler-Cauchy (or equidimensional) equation: $x^2 \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4x \\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0$. This type of equation is characterized by the coefficient of each derivative being a power of x equal to the order of the derivative.",
        "Assume a trial solution of the form $y = x^m$. Compute the first and second derivatives: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = m x^{m-1}$ and $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = m(m-1) x^{m-2}$.",
        "Substitute $y$, $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ into the differential equation: $x^2 [m(m-1) x^{m-2}] + 4x [m x^{m-1}] + 2 [x^m] = 0$. Simplify to $[m(m-1) + 4m + 2] x^m = 0$.",
        "For a nontrivial solution ($x^m \\neq 0$), obtain the auxiliary (characteristic) equation: $m(m-1) + 4m + 2 = 0$. Simplify to $m^2 + 3m + 2 = 0$. Factor this quadratic equation as $(m+1)(m+2) = 0$ to find the roots $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -2$.",
        "Since the roots are distinct real numbers, the general solution is $y(x) = C_1 x^{m_1} + C_2 x^{m_2}$. Substitute the roots to get $y(x) = C_1 x^{-1} + C_2 x^{-2} = \\frac{C_1}{x} + \\frac{C_2}{x^2}$.",
        "Apply the initial conditions $y(1)=0$ and $y'(1)=1$. First, calculate the first derivative of the general solution: $y'(x) = -C_1 x^{-2} - 2C_2 x^{-3} = -\\frac{C_1}{x^2} - \\frac{2C_2}{x^3}$.",
        "Apply the first initial condition $y(1)=0$: $C_1 (1)^{-1} + C_2 (1)^{-2} = C_1 + C_2 = 0$, which implies $C_2 = -C_1$. Apply the second initial condition $y'(1)=1$: $-C_1 (1)^{-2} - 2C_2 (1)^{-3} = -C_1 - 2C_2 = 1$. Substitute $C_2 = -C_1$ into the second equation: $-C_1 - 2(-C_1) = -C_1 + 2C_1 = C_1 = 1$. Therefore, $C_2 = -1$.",
        "Substitute the values of $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = -1$ back into the general solution to obtain the particular solution: $y(x) = 1 \\cdot x^{-1} + (-1) \\cdot x^{-2} = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x^2}$.",
        "Finally, evaluate the particular solution at $x=2$: $y(2) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.",
