For a non-trivial solution to exist, the rank of the matrix must be less than the number of variables (unknowns). This implies that in the RREF, there must be at least one free variable or a row of zeros, which can be used to find conditions on parameters like \\u03b1.",

Cons: Can involve more steps, is prone to arithmetic errors, especially for larger matrices, and requires careful handling of parameters like \\u03b1. Determinant calculation is often faster for $3 \\times 3$ matrices if only the condition for existence is needed.",
        "when_to_use": "When the matrix is not square, when determinant calculation is cumbersome (e.g., for larger matrices), or when the actual non-trivial solutions (the null space) are required, not just the condition for their existence."

This is directly related to finding system modes from homogeneous state equations in state-space representation.",
