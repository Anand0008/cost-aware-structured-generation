      "reasoning": "The question asks for the angular location(s) from the front stagnation point on a circular cylinder where the static pressure ($P$) equals the free-stream static pressure ($P_{\\infty}$). \n\n1. The pressure coefficient ($C_p$) is defined as $C_p = \\frac{P - P_{\\infty}}{0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2}$.\n2. When the static pressure equals the free-stream static pressure ($P = P_{\\infty}$), the numerator becomes zero, which implies $C_p = 0$.\n3. For inviscid, incompressible flow over a circular cylinder, the pressure coefficient is given by the formula: $C_p = 1 - 4 \\sin^2(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angular location from the front stagnation point.\n4. Setting $C_p = 0$ to find the desired locations:\n   $0 = 1 - 4 \\sin^2(\\theta)$\n   $4 \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$\n   $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n   $\\sin(\\theta) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n   $\\sin(\\theta) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$\n5. The angles for which $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}$ are $30^{\\circ}$ and $150^{\\circ}$.\n6. The angles for which $\\sin(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}$ are $-30^{\\circ}$ (or $330^{\\circ}$) and $210^{\\circ}$.\n7. Considering the angular location from the front stagnation point, the primary solutions are $\\pm 30^{\\circ}$. This matches option B."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the problem condition. The static pressure ($P$) on the cylinder surface is equal to the free-stream static pressure ($P_{\\infty}$). This implies that the pressure difference ($P - P_{\\infty}$) is zero.",
        "Step 2: Relate the condition to the pressure coefficient ($C_p$). The pressure coefficient is defined as $C_p = \\frac{P - P_{\\infty}}{0.5 \\rho U_{\\infty}^2}$. Since $P - P_{\\infty} = 0$, it follows that $C_p = 0$ at the desired locations.",
        "Step 3: Recall the formula for $C_p$ on a circular cylinder. For inviscid, incompressible potential flow over a circular cylinder, the pressure coefficient is given by $C_p = 1 - 4 \\sin^2(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angular position from the front stagnation point.",
        "Step 4: Equate the two expressions for $C_p$. Set the cylinder's $C_p$ formula equal to the condition derived in Step 2: $0 = 1 - 4 \\sin^2(\\theta)$.",
        "Step 5: Solve for $\\sin^2(\\theta)$. Rearrange the equation: $4 \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1 \\implies \\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
        "Step 6: Solve for $\\sin(\\theta)$. Take the square root of both sides: $\\sin(\\theta) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.",
        "Step 7: Determine the angular locations. Find the angles $\\theta$ for which $\\sin(\\theta) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. The principal solutions are $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta = -30^{\\circ}$. These can be expressed as $\\pm 30^{\\circ}$ from the front stagnation point.",
        "Step 8: Consider symmetry. Due to the symmetry of the flow around the cylinder, these angles correspond to four points on the cylinder surface: $30^{\\circ}$, $150^{\\circ}$, $210^{\\circ}$ (or $-150^{\\circ}$), and $330^{\\circ}$ (or $-30^{\\circ}$) if measured from the front stagnation point counter-clockwise. However, typically $\\pm 30^{\\circ}$ refers to the angles relative to the horizontal axis passing through the center of the cylinder."
