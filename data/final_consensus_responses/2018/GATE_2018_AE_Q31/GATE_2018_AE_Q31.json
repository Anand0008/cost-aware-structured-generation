      "reasoning": "The question asks to identify the true statement(s) regarding a body in a plane strain condition. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement P:** \"All the points in the body undergo displacements in one plane only, for example the x-y plane, leading to $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0$.\n*   According to the definition of plane strain, a plane strain condition in the x-y plane implies that the normal strain in the z-direction ($\\epsilon_{zz}$) and the shear strains involving the z-axis ($\\gamma_{xz}$, $\\gamma_{yz}$) are zero. This means deformation is confined to the x-y plane. Therefore, Statement P is **TRUE**.\n\n**Statement Q:** \"All the components of stress perpendicular to the plane of deformation, for example the x-y plane, of the body are equal to zero, i.e. $\\sigma_{zz} = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$.\n*   In a plane strain condition, while the shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ are indeed zero (because $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$), the normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is generally *not* zero. A non-zero $\\sigma_{zz}$ is required to prevent deformation (strain) in the z-direction, as per Hooke's Law. The condition where all stress components perpendicular to the plane are zero ($\\sigma_{zz} = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$) defines a plane *stress* condition, not plane *strain*. Therefore, Statement Q is **FALSE**.\n\n**Statement R:** \"Except the normal component, all the other components of stress perpendicular to the plane of deformation of the body, for example the x-y plane, are equal to zero, i.e. $\\sigma_{zz} \\neq 0$, $\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$.\n*   As discussed for Statement Q, in plane strain, $\\sigma_{zz}$ is generally non-zero, and $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ are zero. This statement accurately describes the stress state perpendicular to the plane of deformation in a plane strain condition. Therefore, Statement R is **TRUE**.\n\nSince statements P and R are true, the correct option is D."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the definition of 'Plane Strain Condition'. A state of plane strain in the x-y plane means that the strain components perpendicular to this plane are zero: $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$, and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$. This implies that particles in the body only undergo displacement within the x-y plane.",
        "Step 2: Evaluate Statement P. Statement P directly states that displacements occur in one plane (x-y) only, leading to $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0$. This aligns perfectly with the definition of plane strain. Thus, P is true.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate Statement Q. Statement Q claims that all stress components perpendicular to the plane of deformation are zero ($\\sigma_{zz} = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$). While the shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ are indeed zero in plane strain (because the corresponding shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$ are zero), the normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is generally *not* zero. A non-zero $\\sigma_{zz}$ is required to prevent deformation in the z-direction. This condition ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$) is characteristic of plane *stress*, not plane strain. Thus, Q is false.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate Statement R. Statement R asserts that the normal stress component perpendicular to the plane is non-zero ($\\sigma_{zz} \\neq 0$), while the shear stress components are zero ($\\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$). This correctly describes the stress state in a plane strain condition, where $\\sigma_{zz}$ develops to constrain the material from deforming in the z-direction, even though $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$. Thus, R is true.",
