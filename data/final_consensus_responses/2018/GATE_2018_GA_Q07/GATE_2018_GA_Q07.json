Substituting $L_l = 3L_s$, we get $L_s + 3L_s = 176 \\implies 4L_s = 176 \\implies L_s = 44$ m.\n    *   Therefore, the longer piece length is $L_l = 3 \\times 44 = 132$ m.\n3.  **Calculate the area of the square formed by the longer piece:**\n    *   The longer piece (132 m) is bent into a square.

        "Step 1: Calculate the total length of the wire. The initial square has an area of $1936 \\text{ m}^2$. Its side length is $s = \\sqrt{1936} = 44 \\text{ m}$. The total length of the wire (perimeter) is $L = 4s = 4 \\times 44 = 176 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Step 2: Determine the lengths of the two pieces of wire. Let the shorter piece be $x$ and the longer piece be $3x$. The total length is $x + 3x = 4x = 176 \\text{ m}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 44 \\text{ m}$ (shorter piece) and $3x = 132 \\text{ m}$ (longer piece).",
        "Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the longer piece when bent into a square. The perimeter of this square is $132 \\text{ m}$. Its side length is $s_{square} = 132 / 4 = 33 \\text{ m}$. The area of this square is $A_{square} = s_{square}^2 = 33^2 = 1089 \\text{ m}^2$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the area enclosed by the shorter piece when bent into a circle. The circumference of this circle is $44 \\text{ m}$. Using the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, we find the radius $r = 44 / (2\\pi) = 22 / \\pi \\text{ m}$. The area of the circle is $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (22 / \\pi)^2 = 484 / \\pi \\text{ m}^2$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the total area enclosed by both shapes. The total area is $A_{total} = A_{square} + A_{circle} = 1089 + 484 / \\pi \\text{ m}^2$. Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $A_{total} \\approx 1089 + 154.06 \\approx 1243.06 \\text{ m}^2$.",
