      "reasoning": "The highest limit load factor for civil transport aircraft is typically in the range of 2.0 to 5.0. Civil transport aircraft are designed for a maximum maneuver load factor (n1) of around 2.5g, which is the 'limit load' case. While gust loads can sometimes exceed this at higher speeds, the overall design envelope for normal category aircraft (including civil transports) falls within this range. For example, a 14,000 lb aircraft might have an n1 of approximately 3.8. This range is distinct from aerobatic or military aircraft which have much higher load factors."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Understand the term 'limit load factor'. It is the maximum load factor (ratio of lift to weight, $n = L/W$) an aircraft is designed to withstand without permanent deformation during normal operations, including maneuvers and gusts.",
        "Recognize that airworthiness regulations (e.g., FAR Part 25) define these load factors and categorize aircraft. Civil transport aircraft fall under the 'Transport Category'.",
        "For civil transport aircraft, the positive limit maneuver load factor ($n_1$) is typically around 2.5g for heavier aircraft (above 50,000 lb).",
        "For lighter transport aircraft (less than 50,000 lb), the positive limit load factor can be higher, often calculated using a formula like $n_1 = 2.1 + \\frac{24000}{W + 10000}$, yielding values generally between 2.5g and 3.8g.",
        "This typical range of 2.5g to 3.8g (and up to 5.0g for some lighter transport aircraft or specific conditions) falls within the broader range of 2.0 - 5.0.",
        "Therefore, the highest limit load factor experienced by a civil transport aircraft is typically within the 2.0 - 5.0 range. Other options (e.g., 0.0 - 2.0, 5.0 - 8.0, 8.0 - 10.0) are generally for negative load factors, very light aircraft, or more agile/aerobatic aircraft, not typical civil transport."
