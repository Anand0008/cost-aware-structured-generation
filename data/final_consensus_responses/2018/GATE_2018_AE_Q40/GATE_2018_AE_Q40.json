Given the lift-to-drag ratio L/D = 15, drag D = W / (L/D). Thus, P = (m*g*V) / (L/D). Substituting m = 400000 kg, g = 9.81 m/s², V = 240 m/s, and L/D = 15 yields P = (400000 * 9.81 * 240) / 15 = 62784000 W = 62.784 MW. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 62.78 MW, which lies within the official answer range of 62.00 to 63.50 MW."
