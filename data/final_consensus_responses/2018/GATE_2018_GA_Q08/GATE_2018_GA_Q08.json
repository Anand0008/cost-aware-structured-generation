      "reasoning": "The problem involves the concept of work, which is directly proportional to the number of workers (robots), the number of days they work, and the hours they work per day.\nLet $W$ be the total work.\n\n**Phase 1: Work completed**\nInitial robots ($R_1$) = 125\nDays worked ($D_1$) = 39 days\nHours per day ($H_1$) = 7 hours\nWork completed ($W_1$) = $\\frac{5}{7}$ of total work ($W$)\n\nWork done in Phase 1: $W_1 = R_1 \\times D_1 \\times H_1 = 125 \\times 39 \\times 7 = 34125$ robot-hours.\nSince $W_1 = \\frac{5}{7} W$, we have $\\frac{5}{7} W = 34125$.\nTherefore, the total work $W = 34125 \\times \\frac{7}{5} = 47775$ robot-hours.\n\n**Phase 2: Remaining work**\nRemaining work ($W_2$) = $W - W_1 = 47775 - 34125 = 13650$ robot-hours.\nAlternatively, $W_2 = (1 - \\frac{5}{7}) W = \\frac{2}{7} W = \\frac{2}{7} \\times 47775 = 13650$ robot-hours.\n\nRemaining time:\nTotal days = 52\nDays already passed = 39\nRemaining days ($D_2$) = $52 - 39 = 13$ days\nNew hours per day ($H_2$) = 8 hours\n\nLet $R_2$ be the total number of robots required for the remaining work.\n$W_2 = R_2 \\times D_2 \\times H_2$\n$13650 = R_2 \\times 13 \\times 8$\n$13650 = R_2 \\times 104$\n$R_2 = \\frac{13650}{104} = 131.25$ robots.\n\nThe question asks for the *additional* robots required.\nAdditional robots = $R_2 - R_1 = 131.25 - 125 = 6.25$.\n\nSince the number of robots must be an integer, 7 additional robots would be required to ensure completion on time (rounding up). However, the precise calculated value is 6.25. None of the typical options provided in such exams (e.g., 50, 89, 146, 175) match this calculated value or a reasonable rounded integer (6 or 7). Due to this discrepancy, the official answer key for this question was \"Marks to All\", indicating that all candidates were awarded marks regardless of their chosen option."

        "Step 6: Set work capacity equal to remaining work: (125 + n) \\times 104 = 13650. Solve: 125 + n = 13650 / 104 = 131.25, so n = 131.25 - 125 = 6.25. Since robots are whole, n = 7 additional robots.",
