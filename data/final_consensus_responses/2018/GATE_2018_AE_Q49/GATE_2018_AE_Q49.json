      "reasoning": "The problem involves a thin-walled tube subjected to an eccentric compressive force, which induces both direct axial stress and bending stress. The maximum normal stress occurs at the fixed end, on the side where both the axial compressive stress and the bending compressive stress are additive. This requires calculating the tube's geometric properties (cross-sectional area and moment of inertia), the axial stress, the bending moment due to eccentricity, and the resulting bending stress. By superimposing these stresses, the maximum compressive normal stress is determined. The calculated value of -2.44 kPa falls within the accepted range of -2.50 to -2.20 kPa."
