The dynamic pressure q is obtained from the pitot-static measurement as q = p0 - p1, where p0 is total pressure and p1 is static pressure. Given p0 = 55,000 N/m^2, p1 = 45,280 N/m^2, q = 9,720 N/m^2. Lift L = q * S * CL, and since L = W, wing loading W/S = q * CL = 9,720 * 2 = 19,440 N/m^2. This falls within the answer key range of 18000 to 19440 N/m^2."
