Therefore, we assume $C_{p,0} \\approx C_{p,1} = -1.2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Prandtl-Glauert Compressibility Correction:**\n    The Prandtl-Glauert rule is a widely used linear compressibility correction for subsonic flow, given by:\n    $C_p = \\frac{C_{p,0}}{\\sqrt{1 - M_{\\infty}^2}}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    Using $C_{p,0} = -1.2$ and $M_{\\infty} = 0.6$:\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{\\sqrt{0.64}}$\n    $C_p = \\frac{-1.2}{0.8}$\n    $C_p = -1.5$\n\nThis result matches option C.
