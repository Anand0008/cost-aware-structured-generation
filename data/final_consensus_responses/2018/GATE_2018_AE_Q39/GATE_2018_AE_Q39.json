      "reasoning": "The net hydrostatic force on a vertical plane surface is calculated considering only the gauge pressure of the liquid. This is because the atmospheric pressure acts uniformly on both sides of the tank wall (inside the tank on the water surface and outside on the tank wall), thus canceling out in terms of net force on the wall.\n\nGiven:\n- Side of cubical tank (width of face, $W$): 2 m\n- Height of water ($h_{water}$): 1 m\n- Density of water ($\\rho$): 1000 kg/m$^3$\n- Acceleration due to gravity ($g$): 9.81 m/s$^2$\n\nSteps:\n1.  **Identify the submerged area ($A$)**: The water-filled portion of the side face is a rectangle with width $W = 2$ m and height $h_{water} = 1$ m. So, $A = W \\times h_{water} = 2 \\text{ m} \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 2 \\text{ m}^2$.\n2.  **Determine the depth of the centroid ($h_c$)**: For a rectangular area submerged from its top edge (which is the free surface of the water), the centroid is at half the submerged height. So, $h_c = \\frac{h_{water}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\text{ m}}{2} = 0.5 \\text{ m}$.\n3.  **Apply the hydrostatic force formula**: The hydrostatic force on a submerged plane surface is given by $F = \\rho g h_c A$.\n    $F = (1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3) \\times (9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2) \\times (0.5 \\text{ m}) \\times (2 \\text{ m}^2)$\n    $F = 9810 \\text{ N}$\n4.  **Convert to kiloNewtons**: $F = 9.81 \\text{ kN}$\n\nThis calculated value of 9.81 kN falls within the specified accurate range of 9.80 to 9.81 kN."
