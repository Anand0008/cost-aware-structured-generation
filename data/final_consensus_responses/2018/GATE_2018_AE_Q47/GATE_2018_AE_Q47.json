        "name": "Using the constant 5.2 instead of 5.0",
        "description": "Some textbooks (e.g., Anderson's Introduction to Flight) use $\\delta = 5.2 x / \\sqrt{Re_x}$. This yields a slightly different x, and can be used in the same derivation, leading to $x = \\delta^2 \\rho U_\\infty / (27.04 \\mu)$. The numerical result will be slightly different but still within the accepted range.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Directly matches certain textbook formulas; also acceptable as answer range is broad. Cons: The constant 5.0 is more standard in aerodynamics texts; slightly more cumbersome constant (27.04 instead of 25) and no real accuracy gain for exam purposes.",
        "when_to_use": "If the problem statement explicitly references a textbook that uses 5.2, or if the answer computed with 5.0 is not matching any options, or when you want internal consistency with a specific textbook's examples."

      {
        "name": "Direct iterative solution",
        "description": "Instead of solving algebraically, one could set up the equation $\\delta = 5x/\\sqrt{\\rho Vx/\\mu}$ and solve for x iteratively (e.g., using Newton-Raphson). This would involve guessing an initial value of x, calculating the corresponding Reynolds number and boundary layer thickness, and then updating the guess until the desired thickness is achieved.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: No algebraic manipulation needed; more robust and can handle more complex boundary conditions. Cons: Time-consuming for exam, prone to calculation errors, requires programming skills and takes more computational effort.",
        "when_to_use": "Only if you cannot remember the derived formula and have a calculator with solver function."
