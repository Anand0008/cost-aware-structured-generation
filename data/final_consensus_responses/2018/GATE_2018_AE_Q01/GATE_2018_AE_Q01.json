      "reasoning": "The cross product of two vectors `a` and `b`, denoted as `c = a \\times b`, results in a vector `c` that is inherently orthogonal (perpendicular) to *both* vector `a` and vector `b`. This is a fundamental property of the cross product. Mathematically, this means `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`. For any linear combination, including `a + b`, we can use the distributive property of the dot product: `c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b`. Since `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`, it follows that `c \\cdot (a + b) = 0 + 0 = 0`. Therefore, `c` is orthogonal to `a + b`. Option A is incorrect because `c` is zero only if `a` and `b` are parallel, but they are stated as 'not parallel'. Options B and D are true statements (c is orthogonal to a, and c is orthogonal to b), but option C is a more comprehensive and direct consequence of the fundamental property of the cross product."

        "The cross product `c = a \\times b` produces a vector `c` that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the plane containing both `a` and `b`.",

        "Evaluate Option A: 'zero'. The cross product `a \\times b` is zero if and only if `a` and `b` are parallel. The question states that `a` and `b` are 'not parallel', so `c = a \\times b` cannot be the zero vector. Thus, Option A is incorrect.",
        "Evaluate Options B and D: 'orthogonal to a alone' and 'orthogonal to b alone'. While `c` is indeed orthogonal to `a` and `b`, the word 'alone' implies exclusivity, which is not the case as `c` is orthogonal to *both*. Therefore, these options are incomplete or misleading.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'orthogonal to `a + b`'. To check this, we use the distributive property of the dot product: `c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b`.",
        "Substitute the orthogonality conditions from Step 2: Since `c \\cdot a = 0` and `c \\cdot b = 0`, the equation becomes `c \\cdot (a + b) = 0 + 0 = 0`.",
        "Conclude that `c \\cdot (a + b) = 0`, which means `c` is orthogonal to `a + b`.",
