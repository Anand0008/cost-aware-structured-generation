      "reasoning": "For a clamped-clamped (fixed-fixed) beam of span L with a central point load P, the standard fixed-end moments are equal at both ends and given by M_A = M_B = PL/8 (hogging). This result can be derived from slope-deflection or compatibility methods, or by using the double integration method.\n\n**Derivation using Double Integration Method:**\n1.  **Identify Reactions:** Due to the symmetry of the beam and loading, the vertical reactions at both fixed ends ($R_A$ and $R_B$) are equal: $R_A = R_B = P/2$. Similarly, the moment reactions at both ends ($M_A$ and $M_B$) are equal in magnitude.\n2.  **Bending Moment Equation:** Consider a section of the beam from the left end ($x=0$) to the midspan ($x=L/2$). The bending moment $M(x)$ in this section, considering the unknown moment reaction $M_A$ (assumed positive counter-clockwise) and vertical reaction $R_A = P/2$ (upwards), is:\n    $M(x) = M_A + (P/2)x$\n3.  **Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation:**\n    $EI \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = M(x) = M_A + \\frac{P}{2}x$\n4.  **Integrate for Slope:**\n    $EI \\frac{dy}{dx} = M_A x + \\frac{P}{4}x^2 + C_1$\n5.  **Integrate for Deflection:**\n    $EI y(x) = \\frac{M_A}{2}x^2 + \\frac{P}{12}x^3 + C_1 x + C_2$\n6.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   At the clamped end $x=0$: Deflection $y(0)=0$ and slope $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0$.\n        From $y(0)=0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n        From $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0 \\implies C_1 = 0$.\n    The slope and deflection equations simplify to:\n    $EI \\frac{dy}{dx} = M_A x + \\frac{P}{4}x^2$\n    $EI y(x) = \\frac{M_A}{2}x^2 + \\frac{P}{12}x^3$\n7.  **Apply Symmetry Condition:** Due to the symmetric loading and supports, the slope at the midspan ($x=L/2$) must be zero:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx}(L/2) = 0$\n8.  **Solve for $M_A$:** Substitute $x=L/2$ into the simplified slope equation:\n    $0 = M_A (L/2) + \\frac{P}{4} (L/2)^2$\n    $0 = M_A \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{P}{4} \\frac{L^2}{4}$\n    $0 = M_A \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{PL^2}{16}$\n    $M_A \\frac{L}{2} = -\\frac{PL^2}{16}$\n    $M_A = -\\frac{PL^2}{16} \\times \\frac{2}{L} = -\\frac{PL}{8}$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the moment reaction is a hogging moment (i.e., it acts in the opposite direction to the assumed positive moment). The magnitude of the moment reaction at each fixed end is $\\frac{PL}{8}$."

        "Step 1: Understand the Beam Configuration and Loading. Identify the beam as a clamped-clamped (fixed-fixed) beam of length L with a concentrated point load P applied exactly at its midspan (L/2). Recognize that this is a statically indeterminate problem.",
        "Step 2: Determine Support Reactions (Vertical). Due to the symmetry of the beam and the loading, the vertical reactions at both fixed ends are equal. By summing vertical forces, R_A + R_B = P, so R_A = R_B = P/2. Also, due to symmetry, the moment reactions at both ends (M_A and M_B) will be equal in magnitude.",
        "Step 3: Establish the Bending Moment Equation. Consider a section of the beam from the left end (x=0) up to the midspan (x=L/2). The bending moment M(x) at any point x in this section is given by M(x) = M_A + R_A x = M_A + (P/2)x.",
        "Step 4: Apply the Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation. The fundamental differential equation for beam deflection is EI \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = M(x). Substitute the bending moment expression: EI \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = M_A + \\frac{P}{2}x.",
        "Step 5: Integrate to Find Slope and Deflection Equations. Integrate the equation once to get the slope \\frac{dy}{dx} and a second time to get the deflection y(x), introducing integration constants C_1 and C_2.",
        "Step 6: Apply Boundary Conditions at the Clamped End. For a clamped (fixed) end at x=0, both the deflection and the slope are zero: y(0)=0 and \\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=0. Use these conditions to solve for C_1 and C_2, which will be C_1=0 and C_2=0.",
        "Step 7: Apply Symmetry Condition. For a symmetrically loaded and supported beam, the slope at the midspan (x=L/2) must be zero: \\frac{dy}{dx}(L/2)=0.",
        "Step 8: Solve for the Moment Reaction. Substitute x=L/2 and the determined integration constants into the slope equation from Step 5. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for M_A. This will yield M_A = -PL/8. The magnitude of the moment reaction at each fixed end is therefore PL/8."

Concentrated loads (e.g., from engines or aerodynamic forces) induce fixed-end moments at the root, which are crucial for ensuring the structural integrity of the wing-fuselage joint and sizing the spar.",

Under-design can lead to catastrophic failure, while over-design results in unnecessary weight and cost."
