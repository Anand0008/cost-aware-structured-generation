Applying this formula to the given matrix [[1, 1, -1], [2, 1, 0], [3, 1, 1]] yields a determinant of 0.0. This can also be observed by noting that the rows are linearly dependent (specifically, Row 1 + Row 3 = 2 * Row 2), which implies a determinant of zero. The result 0.0 matches the expected answer."

        "Step 4: Calculate the first term: $a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) = 1(1 \\times 1 - 0 \\times 1) = 1(1 - 0) = 1$.",

Since Row 1 + Row 3 is a scalar multiple of Row 2, the rows are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows has a determinant of zero, confirming the result."
