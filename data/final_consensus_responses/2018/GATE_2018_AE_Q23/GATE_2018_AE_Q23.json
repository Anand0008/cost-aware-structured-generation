Since the masses are connected by a rigid link, they move together as a single effective mass, reducing the system to a single degree of freedom (SDOF). The springs are arranged such that they both resist the motion of this combined mass, meaning they are in a parallel configuration.\n\n1.  **Calculate the equivalent mass ($M_{eq}$):** Since the masses are rigidly linked, they act as a single combined mass:\n    $M_{eq} = m_1 + m_2 = 6 \\text{ kg} + 4 \\text{ kg} = 10 \\text{ kg}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the equivalent stiffness ($K_{eq}$):** For springs in parallel, their stiffnesses add up:\n    $K_{eq} = k_1 + k_2 = 20 \\text{ N/m} + 20 \\text{ N/m} = 40 \\text{ N/m}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the natural frequency ($\\omega_n$):** The natural frequency for an SDOF mass-spring system is given by the formula:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{eq}}{M_{eq}}}$\n    Substituting the calculated values:\n    $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{40 \\text{ N/m}}{10 \\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{4} \\text{ rad/s} = 2.0 \\text{ rad/s}$\n\nThe calculated value of 2.0 rad/s matches the expected answer."
