      "reasoning": "The question asks what happens to the air when a shock wave moves into still air (a moving shock problem). For a normal shock (analyzed in a frame where the shock is stationary), static temperature ($T$) always increases. The key nuance is the behavior of total temperature ($T_0$). For a stationary normal shock in an adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas, $T_0$ remains constant. However, for a shock moving into still air, we analyze in the lab frame. The initially still air has zero velocity, so its lab-frame total temperature equals its static temperature ($T_{0,1} = T_1$). After the shock passes, the air is set into motion with a non-zero velocity $V_2$. Therefore, its lab-frame total temperature becomes $T_{0,2} = T_2 + V_2^2/(2C_p)$, which is greater than $T_1$ because $T_2 > T_1$ and $V_2^2/(2C_p) > 0$. Hence, both static and total temperature increase in the lab frame. Option B correctly states this. This distinction between shock-fixed and lab-frame total temperature is the critical concept tested."

        "Step 1: Understand the scenario. A shock wave is propagating into still air. This is a 'moving shock' problem, where the air ahead of the shock is initially stationary.",
        "Step 2: Analyze in a shock-fixed reference frame. To simplify analysis, we consider a frame of reference moving with the shock. In this frame, the upstream air approaches the stationary shock at supersonic speed.",
        "Step 3: Static property changes. Across a normal shock, the flow undergoes an irreversible process where kinetic energy is converted to internal energy. This leads to an abrupt increase in static pressure, static density, and static temperature ($T_2 > T_1$).",
        "Step 4: Total temperature in the shock-fixed frame. For an adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas across a normal shock, the total enthalpy (and thus total temperature, $T_0'$) remains constant in the shock-fixed frame ($T_{0,1}' = T_{0,2}'$).",
        "Step 5: Total temperature in the lab frame. The question refers to the air *experiencing* the shock, implying the lab frame. In the lab frame, the upstream air is initially still, so its total temperature $T_{0,1}^{lab} = T_1$. The downstream air, after passing through the shock, has a non-zero velocity ($V_2$) and an increased static temperature ($T_2$). The lab-frame total temperature is $T_{0,2}^{lab} = T_2 + V_2^2/(2C_p)$. For a moving shock into still air, it can be shown that the lab-frame total temperature *increases* ($T_{0,2}^{lab} > T_1$).",
        "Step 6: Conclusion. Therefore, when a shock wave moves into still air, the air experiences an increase in both its static temperature and its lab-frame total temperature."
