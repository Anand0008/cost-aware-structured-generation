      "reasoning": "Statement [a] is true: Aircraft wings are designed using a closed-section box beam configuration, often called a 'torque box', which is fundamental to modern aircraft design. Statement [r] is also true: Closed-section box beams are highly efficient at resisting torsional loads due to their ability to form a continuous shear flow path around the enclosed area, providing significantly higher torsional rigidity compared to open sections (as explained by Bredt-Batho theory). Furthermore, [r] is the correct reason for [a]: Aircraft wings are subjected to substantial torsional loads during flight, and the superior capability of closed-section box beams to resist these loads is the primary reason for their use, ensuring structural integrity and aeroelastic stability."

        "Step 1: Analyze Statement [a]. Statement [a] asserts that 'A closed-section box beam configuration is used in aircraft wings.' This is true. Aircraft wings are fundamentally designed around a primary closed box structure, often referred to as a 'torque box', formed by spars and skin panels. This configuration is crucial for effectively carrying various flight loads.",
        "Step 2: Analyze Statement [r]. Statement [r] claims that 'Closed-section box beam configuration is capable of resisting torsional loads.' This is also true. In thin-walled sections, closed sections are highly efficient in resisting torsional loads due to their ability to develop a continuous shear flow path around the enclosed area. This results in significantly higher torsional rigidity (GJ) compared to open sections, which are much less stiff in torsion and primarily resist twist through warping.",
        "Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between [a] and [r]. Aircraft wings are subjected to substantial torsional moments from aerodynamic forces. To prevent excessive twist, which could lead to aeroelastic instabilities, the wing structure must possess high torsional stiffness. The closed-section box beam configuration is specifically chosen because it provides this necessary high torsional resistance and efficiency. Therefore, the capability described in [r] is the direct and primary engineering reason for the design choice in [a].",
        "Step 4: Conclude the logical relationship. Both statement [a] and statement [r] are individually true, and statement [r] correctly explains why statement [a] is true. This aligns with the option indicating that both statements are true and [r] is the correct explanation for [a].",
