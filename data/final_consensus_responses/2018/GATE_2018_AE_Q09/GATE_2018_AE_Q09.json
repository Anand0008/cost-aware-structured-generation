      "reasoning": "The tangential velocity component 'V' for a spacecraft in a stable circular orbit around a central body is derived by balancing the gravitational force with the required centripetal force.\n\n1.  **Gravitational Force ($F_g$)**: According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the force between two bodies of mass $M$ (Earth) and $m$ (spacecraft) separated by a distance $R$ (orbital radius) is given by $F_g = G \\frac{M m}{R^2}$, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.\n2.  **Centripetal Force ($F_c$)**: For an object of mass $m$ moving in a circular path of radius $R$ with tangential velocity $V$, the centripetal force required to maintain this motion is $F_c = \\frac{m V^2}{R}$.\n3.  **Equilibrium for Circular Orbit**: For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force, so $F_g = F_c$.\n    $G \\frac{M m}{R^2} = \\frac{m V^2}{R}$\n4.  **Solving for V**: Cancel $m$ from both sides and multiply by $R$:\n    $G \\frac{M}{R} = V^2$\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{R}}$\n5.  **Using Gravitational Parameter ($\\mu$)**: The question defines the gravitational parameter of Earth as $\\mu = G M$. Substituting this into the velocity equation:\n    $V = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{R}}$\n\nThis expression matches option B. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not represent the correct tangential velocity for a circular orbit (e.g., A resembles escape velocity, C and D involve orbital period related terms)."
