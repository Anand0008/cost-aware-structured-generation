Applying $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=1$ gives $-3C_2 = 1$, so $C_2 = -1/3$ and $C_1 = 1/3$. The solution is $y = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - e^{-3x})$, matching option B."

        "Step 2: Formulate the characteristic (auxiliary) equation. Assume a solution of the form y = e^{mx}. Substituting this into the ODE \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 3\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 yields the characteristic equation: m^2 + 3m = 0.",
        "Step 3: Solve the characteristic equation. Factor m(m+3)=0 to find the roots m_1 = 0 and m_2 = -3.",
        "Step 4: Write the general solution. For distinct real roots m_1 and m_2, the general solution is y = C_1 e^{m_1 x} + C_2 e^{m_2 x}. Substituting m_1=0 and m_2=-3, we get y = C_1 e^{0 \\cdot x} + C_2 e^{-3x} = C_1 + C_2 e^{-3x}.",
        "Step 5: Apply the first initial condition y(0)=0. Substitute x=0 into the general solution y = C_1 + C_2 e^{-3x}: C_1 + C_2 e^{0} = C_1 + C_2 = 0. This implies C_1 = -C_2.",
        "Step 6: Compute the first derivative of the general solution: \\frac{dy}{dx} = -3 C_2 e^{-3x}. Apply the second initial condition \\frac{dy}{dx}(0)=1: -3 C_2 e^{0} = -3 C_2 = 1. From this, we find C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}.",
        "Step 7: Determine C_1 using the relation C_1 = -C_2. Since C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}, we have C_1 = -(-\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}.",
        "Step 8: Substitute the values of C_1 = \\frac{1}{3} and C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3} into the general solution y = C_1 + C_2 e^{-3x} to obtain the particular solution: y = \\frac{1}{3} + (-\\frac{1}{3}) e^{-3x} = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - e^{-3x})."
