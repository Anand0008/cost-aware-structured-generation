      "reasoning": "The image displays a velocity profile where the x-axis represents the normalized stream-wise velocity component, $u(y)/U$, and the y-axis represents the distance from the wall, $y$. The free-stream velocity is $U$. The black shaded region represents the area between the ideal inviscid flow (where $u(y)/U = 1$) and the actual viscous flow profile $u(y)/U$. \n\nMathematically, the area of this shaded region can be expressed as the integral of the horizontal distance from the line $u(y)/U = 1$ to the curve $u(y)/U$, integrated over the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$. This horizontal distance at any $y$ is $1 - u(y)/U$. \n\nTherefore, the shaded area is given by the integral: \n$$\\int_0^\\delta \\left(1 - \\frac{u(y)}{U}\\right) dy$$ \nThis integral is the precise definition of the displacement thickness ($\\delta^*$). The displacement thickness represents the distance by which the external inviscid streamlines are displaced outwards due to the velocity deficit within the boundary layer. \n\nLet's review the other options:\nA. Boundary layer thickness ($\\delta$): This is the physical thickness of the boundary layer, typically defined as the distance from the wall where $u(y)$ reaches 99% of $U$. It is a length, not an area represented by the integral of the velocity deficit.\nB. Momentum thickness ($\\theta$): This is defined as $\\theta = \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{u(y)}{U} \\left(1 - \\frac{u(y)}{U}\\right) dy$. This integral is different from the shaded area shown in the figure.\nD. Shape factor (H): This is a dimensionless ratio, $H = \\frac{\\delta^*}{\\theta}$, not an area.\n\nThus, the black shaded region correctly represents the displacement thickness."
