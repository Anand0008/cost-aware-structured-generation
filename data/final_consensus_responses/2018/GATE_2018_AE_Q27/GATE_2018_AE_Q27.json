This can be written as $p/\\rho^\\gamma = p_1/\\rho_1^\\gamma$, which allows us to express density as a function of pressure: $\\rho = \\rho_1 (p/p_1)^{1/\\gamma}$.\n\n3.  **Substitute the expression for $\\rho$ into the integral term:**\n    $\\int_{p_1}^{p_2} \\frac{dp}{\\rho} = \\int_{p_1}^{p_2} \\frac{dp}{\\rho_1 (p/p_1)^{1/\\gamma}} = \\frac{p_1^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_1} \\int_{p_1}^{p_2} p^{-1/\\gamma} dp$\n\n4.  **Perform the integration using the power rule $\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$:**\n    $\\int p^{-1/\\gamma} dp = \\frac{p^{(-1/\\gamma) + 1}}{(-1/\\gamma) + 1} = \\frac{p^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}}{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} p^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    $\\int_{p_1}^{p_2} \\frac{dp}{\\rho} = \\frac{p_1^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_1} \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\left( p_2^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} - p_1^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} \\right)$\n\n6.  **Substitute this back into Bernoulli's equation:**\n    $\\frac{V_2^2}{2} - \\frac{V_1^2}{2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{p_1^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_1} \\left( p_2^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} - p_1^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} \\right) = 0$\n\n7.  **Rearrange the terms to match the format of the options (with $V_1^2/2 - V_2^2/2$ on one side):**\n    $\\frac{V_1^2}{2} - \\frac{V_2^2}{2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{p_1^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_1} \\left( p_2^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} - p_1^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} \\right)$\n\n8.  **Define the constant $c = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{p_1^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_1}$ (which is constant for a given initial state and gas properties).** The relation becomes:\n    $c \\left( p_2^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} - p_1^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} \\right) = \\frac{V_1^2}{2} - \\frac{V_2^2}{2}$\n\nThis form precisely matches option C."
