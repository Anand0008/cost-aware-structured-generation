      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the air density at a specific altitude (3500 m) under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions. Since 3500 m is within the troposphere (0-11 km), the temperature decreases linearly with altitude, and the atmosphere is not isothermal. Therefore, the ISA tropospheric model must be applied.\n\nGiven ISA standard sea level conditions:\n*   Sea level temperature, $T_0 = 288.16 \\text{ K}$\n*   Sea level density, $\\rho_0 = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n*   Acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$\n*   Specific gas constant for air, $R = 287 \\text{ J/(kg-K)}$\n*   Altitude, $h = 3500 \\text{ m}$\n\nAdditional ISA constant for the troposphere:\n*   Temperature lapse rate, $a = -0.0065 \\text{ K/m}$ (where $a$ is the lapse rate, typically negative for temperature decrease)\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the temperature at altitude $h$ ($T_h$)**\nIn the troposphere, temperature varies linearly with altitude:\n$T_h = T_0 + a h$\n$T_h = 288.16 \\text{ K} + (-0.0065 \\text{ K/m} \\times 3500 \\text{ m})$\n$T_h = 288.16 - 22.75 = 265.41 \\text{ K}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the density at altitude $h$ ($\\rho_h$) using the ISA density ratio formula**\nFor the troposphere, the density variation is given by:\n$\\frac{\\rho_h}{\\rho_0} = \\left( \\frac{T_h}{T_0} \\right)^{\\left( -\\frac{g}{a R} - 1 \\right)}$\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\nExponent $= -\\frac{g}{a R} - 1 = -\\frac{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2}{(-0.0065 \\text{ K/m}) \\times 287 \\text{ J/(kg-K)}} - 1$\nExponent $= \\frac{9.81}{1.8655} - 1 \\approx 5.25891 - 1 = 4.25891$\nNow, substitute the values:\n$\\frac{\\rho_h}{1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3} = \\left( \\frac{265.41 \\text{ K}}{288.16 \\text{ K}} \\right)^{4.25891}$\n$\\frac{\\rho_h}{1.225} = (0.92094)^{4.25891}$\n$\\frac{\\rho_h}{1.225} \\approx 0.7040$\n$\\rho_h = 1.225 \\times 0.7040 \\approx 0.8624 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the density is $0.86 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.
