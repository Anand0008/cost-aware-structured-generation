In the context of 'The dress _________ her so well', 'complemented' means the dress enhanced her appearance or suited her well.\n\n2.  **Compliment (verb)**: To express praise, admiration, or congratulation. In the context of 'they all immediately _________ her on her appearance', 'complimented' means they praised her for how she looked.\n\nTherefore, the correct words to fill the blanks are 'complemented' and 'complimented', which corresponds to option D."
