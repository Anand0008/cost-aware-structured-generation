      "reasoning": "The question asks for the maximum tensile stress in a solid circular shaft under pure torsion.\n\n1.  **Identify the stress state:** For a solid circular shaft under pure torsion, the stress state at any point on the outer surface is one of pure shear. The maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) occurs at the outer surface.\n\n2.  **Calculate maximum shear stress:** The formula for maximum shear stress in a solid circular shaft of diameter 'd' subjected to a torque 'T' is derived from the torsion formula `$\\tau = Tr/J$`. For a solid circular shaft, the polar moment of inertia `J = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{32}` and the maximum radius `r = d/2`. Substituting these values, the maximum shear stress is `$\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T(d/2)}{(\\pi d^4)/32} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d^3}$`.\n\n3.  **Determine principal stresses from pure shear:** For a state of pure shear (where normal stresses `$\\sigma_x = 0$`, `$\\sigma_y = 0$`, and shear stress `$\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{max}$`), the principal stresses (maximum normal stresses) can be found using Mohr's Circle or the principal stress formulas. The principal stresses are `$\\sigma_1 = \\tau_{max}$` (maximum tensile stress) and `$\\sigma_2 = -\\tau_{max}$` (maximum compressive stress).\n\n4.  **Substitute `$\\tau_{max}$`:** Therefore, the maximum tensile stress experienced at any point on the shaft is equal to the maximum shear stress: `$\\sigma_{tensile, max} = \\tau_{max} = \\frac{16T}{\\pi d^3}$`.\n\nThis matches option D."
