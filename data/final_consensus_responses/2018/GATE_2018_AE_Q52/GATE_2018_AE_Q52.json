From the first equation: $2A x + 12x = 0 \\implies 2x(A+6)=0$. For this to hold for all $x$, $A+6=0$, hence $A=-6$. The second equation is automatically satisfied: $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial x} = 12y$, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} = -12y$, so $12y -12y=0$. Therefore, $A = -6.0$."
