This idealization serves as a theoretical benchmark for maximum efficiency."

All real processes are irreversible due to factors like friction and heat transfer across a finite temperature difference. An adiabatic process is a process with zero heat transfer (dQ = 0) between the system and its surroundings. Compressors and turbines are typically modeled as adiabatic because the fluid passes through them so quickly that there is negligible time for heat transfer. An isentropic process is a process that is both adiabatic and reversible."
