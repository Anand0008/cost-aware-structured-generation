      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle for steady, level flight. For an aircraft in steady, level flight, lift (L) equals weight (W). The gross weight of 2000 kg is constant.\nStep 2: Recall the lift equation: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$, where $\\rho$ is air density, $V$ is speed, $S$ is wing area, and $C_L$ is the lift coefficient.\nStep 3: For steady, level flight at constant weight, the lift (L) must be constant. Assuming the aircraft maintains the same configuration (constant wing area S) and flies at the same angle of attack (constant lift coefficient $C_L$), then the dynamic pressure term $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$ must remain constant between the two altitudes. This simplifies to $\\rho V^2 = \\text{constant}$.\nStep 4: Set up the equality for the two flight conditions (sea level, subscript 1, and altitude, subscript 2): $\\rho_1 V_1^2 = \\rho_2 V_2^2$.\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown speed at altitude, $V_2$: $V_2^2 = V_1^2 \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}$, which gives $V_2 = V_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}}$.\nStep 6: Substitute the given values:\nSea level conditions: $V_1 = 130 \\text{ m/s}$, $\\rho_1 = 1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\nAltitude conditions: $\\rho_2 = 0.47 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n$V_2 = 130 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{0.47 \\text{ kg/m}^3}}$.\nStep 7: Calculate the numerical value:\n$V_2 = 130 \\times \\sqrt{2.617021...}$\n$V_2 = 130 \\times 1.617727...$\n$V_2 \\approx 210.3045 \\text{ m/s}$.\nStep 8: Round the result to two decimal places as requested: $210.30 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 2: Write the lift equation: $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$, where $\\rho$ is air density, V is true airspeed, S is wing area, and $C_L$ is the lift coefficient. For the same aircraft in steady level flight, S and $C_L$ are assumed constant.",
        "Step 3: For steady, level flight, lift ($L$) equals weight ($W$). Since the aircraft's weight, wing area ($S$), and lift coefficient ($C_L$) are constant, the lift generated must be the same at both altitudes. From the lift equation ($L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$), this implies that the dynamic pressure ($q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$) must be constant between the two flight conditions, i.e., $\\rho V^2 = \\text{constant}$.",
        "Step 4: Equate the dynamic pressure at sea level (subscript 'sl') and at 9000 m altitude (subscript 'alt'): $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{sl} V_{sl}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{alt} V_{alt}^2$. This simplifies to $\\rho_{sl} V_{sl}^2 = \\rho_{alt} V_{alt}^2$.",
        "Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for the speed at altitude ($V_{alt}$): $V_{alt} = V_{sl} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{sl}}{\\rho_{alt}}}$.",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given values into the formula: $V_{sl} = 130 \\text{ m/s}$, $\\rho_{sl} = 1.23 \\text{ kg/m}^3$, and $\\rho_{alt} = 0.47 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. Calculate the ratio of densities: $\\frac{\\rho_{sl}}{\\rho_{alt}} = \\frac{1.23}{0.47} \\approx 2.61702$.",
        "Step 7: Perform the final calculation: $V_{alt} = 130 \\times \\sqrt{2.61702} \\approx 130 \\times 1.6177 \\approx 210.301 \\text{ m/s}$.",

The pilot primarily monitors indicated airspeed for stall and maneuvering limits, while true airspeed is used for navigation and fuel planning.",
