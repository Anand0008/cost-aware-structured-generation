This means the neutral point (NP) is 0.8 m *aft* of the center of gravity (CG) in the standard aft-positive convention. The question asks for the location of the neutral point from the center of gravity, with positive towards the nose. Therefore, if the neutral point is 0.8 m aft of the CG, its position relative to the CG, with positive towards the nose, is $-0.8 \\text{ m}$. This is consistent with a statically stable aircraft, where the center of gravity is ahead of the neutral point. The calculated value of $-0.80 \\text{ m}$ falls within the acceptable range of $-0.81$ to $-0.79 \\text{ m}$."

        "Step 2: Calculate the pitching moment derivative with respect to the angle of attack. Differentiate the given $C_{m,cg}$ expression: $\\frac{dC_{m,cg}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} (0.05 - 4\\alpha) = -4$. Recall the fundamental longitudinal static stability relationship: $\\frac{\\partial C_{m,cg}}{\\partial \\alpha} = C_{L_\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{x_{cg} - x_{np}}{\\bar{c}} \\right)$, where $x_{cg}$ and $x_{np}$ are measured from a fixed reference (e.g., leading edge) positive aft.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for the relative position. We have $-4 = 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{x_{cg} - x_{np}}{1} \\right)$. Solving for $(x_{cg} - x_{np})$ gives $x_{cg} - x_{np} = -\\frac{4}{5} = -0.8$. This implies $x_{np} - x_{cg} = 0.8 \\text{ m}$. This means the neutral point (NP) is 0.8 m *aft* of the center of gravity (CG) in the standard aft-positive convention. The question asks for the location (positive towards the nose) of the neutral point from the center of gravity. Therefore, if the neutral point is 0.8 m aft of the CG, its position relative to the CG, with positive towards the nose, is $-0.8 \\text{ m}$.",
        "Solve for the neutral point location relative to the center of gravity using the derived formula. In a standard convention where positive $x$ is aft, $x_{np} - x_{cg} = 0.8$ m, meaning the neutral point is 0.8 m aft of the CG.",
