We need to calculate the closed contour integral $\\oint_C \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$, where the contour $C$ encloses the origin. This is a classic 2D vortex field with a singularity at the origin $(0,0)$. Due to this singularity, Green's Theorem cannot be directly applied to the entire region enclosed by $C$. However, the circulation around any simple closed contour enclosing the origin is constant.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we parameterize a simple closed contour enclosing the origin, such as a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin. Let this contour be $C$.\n\n1.  **Parameterize the contour $C$**: In polar coordinates, for a circle of radius $R$:\n    $x = R\\cos\\theta$\n    $y = R\\sin\\theta$\n    where $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$ for a closed loop.\n\n2.  **Find the differential displacement vector $d\\mathbf{s}$**: \n    $d\\mathbf{s} = dx\\mathbf{i} + dy\\mathbf{j}$\n    $dx = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(R\\cos\\theta) d\\theta = -R\\sin\\theta d\\theta$\n    $dy = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(R\\sin\\theta) d\\theta = R\\cos\\theta d\\theta$\n    So, $d\\mathbf{s} = (-R\\sin\\theta d\\theta)\\mathbf{i} + (R\\cos\\theta d\\theta)\\mathbf{j}$.\n\n3.  **Express the vector field $\\mathbf{v}$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $R$**: \n    Since $r^2 = x^2+y^2 = (R\\cos\\theta)^2 + (R\\sin\\theta)^2 = R^2(\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta) = R^2$.\n    $\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{R\\sin\\theta}{R^2} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{R\\cos\\theta}{R^2} \\mathbf{j} = -\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{R} \\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{R} \\mathbf{j}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dot product $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s}$**: \n    $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = \\left(-\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{R}\\right)(-R\\sin\\theta d\\theta) + \\left(\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{R}\\right)(R\\cos\\theta d\\theta)$\n    $= (\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) d\\theta$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$, we get:\n    $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = 1 \\cdot d\\theta = d\\theta$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the contour integral**: \n    $\\oint_C \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$.\n\nNumerically, $2\\pi \\approx 2 \\times 3.14159 = 6.28318$.
