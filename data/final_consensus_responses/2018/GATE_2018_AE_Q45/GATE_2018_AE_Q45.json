      "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the maximum Mach number in the discharge from a duct where air flows at Mach 3.0. The key is to correctly identify the stagnation conditions for the flow leaking out. The local stagnation pressure (P0_local) and stagnation temperature (T0_local) are derived from the given static conditions (P1=50 kPa, T1=400 K) and Mach number (M1=3.0) in the duct using isentropic relations. Once P0_local is found, the flow is assumed to expand isentropically from this P0_local to the ambient pressure (P_ambient=30 kPa). The ratio P_ambient/P0_local is then used in the isentropic pressure-Mach number relation to find the exit Mach number. It's important to note that the pressure ratio (P_ambient/P0_local) is very low, indicating that the flow will be choked at the throat (M=1) and then accelerate further to a supersonic Mach number in the discharge. The calculation yields M ≈ 3.35."

        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters: Static pressure in duct ($P_1 = 50$ kPa), static temperature ($T_1 = 400$ K), Mach number in duct ($M_1 = 3.0$), specific heat ratio ($\\gamma = 1.4$), and ambient pressure ($P_{\\text{amb}} = 30$ kPa).",
        "Step 2: Compute the stagnation temperature ($T_{01}$) inside the duct using the isentropic relation: $T_{01} = T_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right)$. Substituting the values: $T_{01} = 400 \\times (1 + 0.2 \\times 9) = 400 \\times 2.8 = 1120 \\text{ K}$.",
        "Step 3: Compute the stagnation pressure ($P_{01}$) inside the duct using the isentropic relation: $P_{01} = P_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$. Substituting the values: $P_{01} = 50 \\times (2.8)^{3.5} \\approx 50 \\times 36.733 = 1836.65 \\text{ kPa}$.",
        "Step 4: Assume isentropic expansion from the duct's stagnation conditions to the ambient pressure. Calculate the pressure ratio for the discharge: $P_{\\text{amb}} / P_{01} = 30 / 1836.65 \\approx 0.016337$.",
        "Step 5: Use the isentropic pressure-Mach number relation to find the exit Mach number ($M_e$) at which the flow expands to the ambient pressure. The relation is: $\\frac{P_{\\text{amb}}}{P_{01}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2\\right)^{-\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}$. Rearranging: $\\left(1 + 0.2 M_e^2\\right)^{3.5} = \\frac{1}{0.016337} \\approx 61.207$.",
        "Step 6: Solve for $M_e$: $1+0.2 M_e^2 = 61.207^{1/3.5} = 61.207^{2/7} \\approx 3.240$. Then $0.2 M_e^2 = 2.240$, so $M_e^2 = 11.20$, giving $M_e = \\sqrt{11.20} \\approx 3.3466$.",
        "Step 7: Round the result to two decimal places: $M_e \\approx 3.35$. This is the maximum Mach number achieved in the discharge."
