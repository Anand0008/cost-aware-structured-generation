      "reasoning": "The sentence uses the conjunction 'though' to introduce a contrast: despite being 'shaken by false allegations of wrongdoing,' the judge's standing 'remained _________.' This implies that the standing was not negatively affected or was restored to its original state. 'Undiminished' (Option A) means not reduced or lessened, which perfectly fits this context, conveying that the false allegations did not succeed in lowering the judge's reputation.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\nB. 'damaged': This would contradict the idea that the standing 'remained' in a positive or neutral state despite *false* allegations.\nC. 'illegal': This word is irrelevant to the concept of a judge's 'standing' or reputation in the community.\nD. 'uncertain': While false allegations might initially create uncertainty, 'remained uncertain' does not convey the sense of resilience or maintenance of status implied by the sentence, especially given the 'false' nature of the allegations."

        "Systematically evaluate each given option to see which one logically completes the sentence, upholding the contrast and the meaning of persistence.",
        "Identify \"undiminished\" as the correct choice because it signifies that the judge's standing was not lessened or reduced, perfectly conveying resilience against the \"false allegations\" and aligning with the word \"remained.\"",
        "Confirm that other options (damaged, illegal, uncertain) are incorrect as they either contradict the sentence's logic or are semantically inappropriate for \"standing.\""
