      "reasoning": "For a straight radial impeller in slip-free operation, the exit blade angle is 90°, meaning the relative velocity is purely radial. Therefore, the radial component of absolute velocity, $V_{f2}$, is equal to the relative velocity, $V_{r2}$. Given $V_{r2} = 100$ m/s, we have $V_{f2} = 100$ m/s. For slip-free operation, the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the exit, $V_{w2}$, is equal to the impeller tip speed, $U_2$. Given $U_2 = 200$ m/s, we have $V_{w2} = 200$ m/s. The absolute velocity at the impeller exit, $V_2$, is the vector sum of its radial and tangential components. Using the Pythagorean theorem (from the velocity triangle), $V_2 = \\sqrt{V_{f2}^2 + V_{w2}^2} = \\sqrt{(100)^2 + (200)^2} = \\sqrt{10000 + 40000} = \\sqrt{50000} = 100\\sqrt{5} \\approx 223.60679$ m/s. Rounded to one decimal place, $V_2 = 223.6$ m/s. This value falls within the typical acceptable range for such problems."

        "Interpret the condition \"straight radial impeller\". For radial blades, the exit blade angle $\\beta_2 = 90^\\circ$. This means the relative velocity ($W_2$) is purely in the radial direction.

        "Interpret the \"slip-free\" condition. For slip-free operation, the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the exit ($V_{w2}$) is equal to the impeller tip speed ($U_2$). Thus, $V_{w2} = U_2 = 200$ m/s.",
        "Apply the velocity triangle relation at the impeller exit. The absolute velocity ($V_2$) is the vector sum of its radial ($V_{r2}$) and tangential ($V_{w2}$) components.
