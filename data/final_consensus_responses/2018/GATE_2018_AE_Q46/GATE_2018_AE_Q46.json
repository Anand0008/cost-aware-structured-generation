      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the Mach number of the tangential component of the flow post-shock. There can be ambiguity between 'tangential to the shock wave' and 'tangential to the wedge surface'. The GATE answer range (1.90-2.20) suggests an interpretation that accounts for the change in speed of sound across the shock, or the component parallel to the wedge surface. \nGiven: Upstream Mach number M1 = 3.0, half-angle wedge θ = 20°, shock-wave angle β = 36°.\n\n1.  Calculate the normal component of the upstream Mach number: M1n = M1 sin(β) = 3.0 * sin(36°) ≈ 1.763.\n2.  Using normal shock relations (for γ = 1.4), find the normal Mach number downstream (M2n) and the temperature ratio (T2/T1).\n    M2n^2 = (M1n^2 + 2/(γ-1)) / (2γ/(γ-1) * M1n^2 - 1)\n    For M1n ≈ 1.763, M2n ≈ 0.639.\n    T2/T1 = (1 + (γ-1)/2 * M1n^2) * (2γ/(γ-1) * M1n^2 - 1) / ((((γ+1)/2)^2) * M1n^2)\n    For M1n ≈ 1.763, T2/T1 ≈ 1.48.\n3.  The tangential velocity component (V_t) is conserved across the shock (V_t1 = V_t2). However, the tangential Mach number (M_t = V_t / a) changes because the speed of sound (a) changes due to temperature variation (a ∝ √T).\n    M_t1 = M1 cos(β) = 3.0 * cos(36°) ≈ 2.427.\n    M_t2 = V_t2 / a2 = V_t1 / a2 = (M1 cos(β) * a1) / a2 = M1 cos(β) / √(T2/T1).\n    M_t2 ≈ 2.427 / √(1.48) ≈ 2.427 / 1.216 ≈ 1.996.\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 1.98-2.00 is consistent with the official answer range (1.90-2.20).",

        "Step 3: Apply normal shock relations to find the temperature ratio T2/T1. Using the formula for γ=1.4: T2/T1 = (2γ M1n² - (γ-1)) * ((γ-1)M1n² + 2) / ((γ+1)² M1n²). Substitute M1n² ≈ 3.1096 to get T2/T1 ≈ 1.5046.",
