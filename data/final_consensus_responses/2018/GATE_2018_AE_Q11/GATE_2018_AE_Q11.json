      "reasoning": "In an elliptical orbit, a spacecraft's motion is governed by Kepler's Second Law, which states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun (or a spacecraft and its central body) sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This law is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum (H) of a spacecraft in orbit is given by $H = r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the central body and $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the angular velocity (often denoted as $\\omega$). Since angular momentum is conserved, $r^2 \\omega = \\text{constant}$. This implies that $\\omega$ is inversely proportional to $r^2$. Therefore, to have the maximum angular velocity, the spacecraft must be at the point where its radial distance $r$ is minimum. This point is the periapsis (or perigee for Earth orbits), which is the closest point to the central body. Conversely, the angular velocity is minimum at the apoapsis (or apogee), where $r$ is maximum. This is also consistent with the physical intuition that satellites in elliptical orbits speed up at periapsis and slow down at apoapsis, implying higher linear and angular velocity at periapsis."

        "From the conservation of angular momentum ($r^2 \\omega = \\text{constant}$ or $h = r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$), it follows that the angular velocity ($\\omega$ or $\\dot{\\theta}$) is inversely proportional to the square of the radial distance ($r^2$).",
        "Identify the points in an elliptical orbit: Periapsis is the point where the spacecraft is closest to the central body (minimum $r$), and apoapsis is where it is furthest (maximum $r$).",
        "Based on the inverse square relationship, when the radial distance ($r$) is minimum (at periapsis), the angular velocity ($\\omega$) will be maximum. Conversely, when $r$ is maximum (at apoapsis), $\\omega$ will be minimum.",
