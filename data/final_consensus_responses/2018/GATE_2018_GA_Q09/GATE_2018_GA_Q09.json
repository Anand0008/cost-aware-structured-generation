We systematically evaluate each statement for each option, understanding that a logical implication P \\implies Q is true unless P is true and Q is false.\n\n**Statement i:** If the house number is a multiple of 3, then it is a number from 50 to 59.\n**Statement ii:** If the house number is NOT a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 to 69.\n**Statement iii:** If the house number is NOT a multiple of 6, then it is a number from 70 to 79.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n*   **A. 54**\n    *   **Statement i:** 54 is a multiple of 3 ($54 = 3 \\times 18$). It is also from 50 to 59. So, Statement i is satisfied (True \\implies True).\n    *   **Statement ii:** 54 is NOT a multiple of 4 ($54 \\div 4 = 13.5$). According to the statement, if it's NOT a multiple of 4, it must be from 60 to 69. But 54 is not in this range. So, Statement ii is NOT satisfied (True \\implies False).\n    *   Therefore, 54 is not the house number.\n\n*   **B. 65**\n    *   **Statement i:** 65 is NOT a multiple of 3 ($65 \\div 3 \\approx 21.67$). Since the premise (house number is a multiple of 3) is false, Statement i is satisfied (False \\implies Anything is True, also known as vacuously true).\n    *   **Statement ii:** 65 is NOT a multiple of 4 ($65 \\div 4 = 16.25$). It is from 60 to 69. So, Statement ii is satisfied (True \\implies True).\n    *   **Statement iii:** 65 is NOT a multiple of 6 ($65 \\div 6 \\approx 10.83$). According to the statement, if it's NOT a multiple of 6, it must be from 70 to 79. But 65 is not in this range. So, Statement iii is NOT satisfied (True \\implies False).\n    *   Therefore, 65 is not the house number.\n\n*   **C. 66**\n    *   **Statement i:** 66 is a multiple of 3 ($66 = 3 \\times 22$). According to the statement, if it's a multiple of 3, it must be from 50 to 59. But 66 is not in this range. So, Statement i is NOT satisfied (True \\implies False).\n    *   Therefore, 66 is not the house number.\n\n*   **D. 76**\n    *   **Statement i:** 76 is NOT a multiple of 3 ($76 \\div 3 \\approx 25.33$). Since the premise is false, Statement i is satisfied (False \\implies Anything is True).\n    *   **Statement ii:** 76 IS a multiple of 4 ($76 = 4 \\times 19$). Since the premise (house number is NOT a multiple of 4) is false, Statement ii is satisfied (False \\implies Anything is True).\n    *   **Statement iii:** 76 is NOT a multiple of 6 ($76 \\div 6 \\approx 12.67$). It is from 70 to 79. So, Statement iii is satisfied (True \\implies True).\n    *   All three statements are satisfied for 76. Thus, 76 is the house number."
