Let 'S' be the set of students and 'NI' be the set of people not involved in the strike. The statement can be represented as S ∩ NI ≠ Ø. Option 4 states: \"Some who were not involved in the strike were students.\" This can be represented as NI ∩ S ≠ Ø. These two statements are logically equivalent; they convey the exact same information. If the original statement is true, then option 4 must also be true as a direct restatement.\n\nOptions 1 and 3 (\"Some who were involved in the strike were students\" / \"At least one student was involved in the strike\") are not necessarily true. The original statement only guarantees that *some* students were *not* involved; it provides no information about whether *any* students *were* involved. It's possible that all students were not involved.\n\nOption 2 (\"No student was involved in the strike\") is also not necessarily true, as the original statement allows for the possibility that some students *were* involved while others were not. Therefore, option C (conclusion 4) is the only logically necessary conclusion from the given statement."
