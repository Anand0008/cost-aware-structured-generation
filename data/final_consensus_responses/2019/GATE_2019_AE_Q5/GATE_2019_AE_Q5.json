      "reasoning": "The existence of a velocity potential $\\phi$ for a flow field $\\mathbf{V}$ is defined by the relationship $\\mathbf{V} = \\nabla \\phi$. A fundamental vector identity states that the curl of the gradient of any scalar function is identically zero, i.e., $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla f) = 0$ for any scalar function $f$. Applying this identity to the velocity potential, we get $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi) = 0$. Since $\\mathbf{V} = \\nabla \\phi$, it necessarily implies that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V} = 0$. This condition defines an irrotational flow, which is necessarily true if a velocity potential exists.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A. $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$ (Laplace's Equation):** This equation is valid only if the flow is *both* irrotational and incompressible (i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0$). The question only states that $\\phi$ is a velocity potential, which guarantees irrotationality, but not necessarily incompressibility. Therefore, this is not *necessarily* true.\n*   **C. $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0$ (Incompressible Flow):** This condition implies that the flow is incompressible. The existence of a velocity potential does not inherently mean the flow is incompressible. A compressible irrotational flow can still have a velocity potential, but it would not satisfy $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = 0$ (and thus not Laplace's equation).\n*   **D. $u = -\\partial \\phi / \\partial y, \\ v = \\partial \\phi / \\partial x$:** This set of equations relates velocity components to a *stream function* ($\\psi$) for a two-dimensional incompressible flow, not a velocity potential. For a velocity potential $\\phi$, the velocity components are defined as $u = \\partial \\phi / \\partial x$ and $v = \\partial \\phi / \\partial y$."

        "**Step 2: Apply the curl operator.** If a velocity potential \\(\\phi\\) exists, then the velocity vector is given by \\(\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi\\). Taking the curl of both sides, we get \\(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi)\\).",
        "**Step 3: Recall the fundamental vector identity.** A fundamental identity in vector calculus states that the curl of the gradient of any continuously differentiable scalar function is always identically zero. That is, for any scalar function \\(f\\), \\(\\nabla \\times (\\nabla f) = 0\\).",
        "**Step 4: Conclude the necessary condition.** Based on this vector identity, if a velocity potential \\(\\phi\\) exists, then \\(\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi)\\) must be zero. Therefore, \\(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0\\). This condition signifies that the flow is irrotational, which is a necessary condition for the existence of a velocity potential.",
        "**Step 5: Evaluate other options.**\n*   Option A, \\(\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\) (Laplace's equation), is true only if the flow is both irrotational and incompressible (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0\\)). The problem statement does not specify incompressibility.\n*   Option C, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0\\), is the continuity equation for incompressible flow, which is not a necessary condition for a potential to exist.\n*   Option D gives incorrect component relations; the correct relations from \\(\\vec{V} = \\nabla \\phi\\) are \\(u = \\partial \\phi / \\partial x\\) and \\(v = \\partial \\phi / \\partial y\\) in Cartesian coordinates.\n*   Thus, \\(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0\\) is the only necessarily true condition.",

Then, calculate the z-component of the curl of $\\vec{V}$ (which is the only non-zero component for a 2D flow in the xy-plane): $(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V})_z = (\\partial v / \\partial x - \\partial u / \\partial y)$. Substitute the expressions for $u$ and $v$: $(\\nabla \\times \\vec{V})_z = (\\partial (\\partial \\phi / \\partial y) / \\partial x - \\partial (\\partial \\phi / \\partial x) / \\partial y)$. Since the order of partial differentiation does not matter for continuously differentiable functions (i.e., $\\partial^2 \\phi / (\\partial x \\partial y) = \\partial^2 \\phi / (\\partial y \\partial x)$), the expression simplifies to zero. Thus, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{V} = 0$.",
