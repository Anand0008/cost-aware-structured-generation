This is due to the fundamental differences in the flow path and pressure generation mechanisms, allowing for a larger change in kinetic energy and subsequent diffusion in a radial flow path. Therefore, the CPR of an axial compressor is less than the CPR of a centrifugal compressor for a single stage, making option B correct."

        "Understand the question: It asks to compare the 'highest possible compressor pressure ratio (CPR)' for a single-stage subsonic compressor between axial and centrifugal types, focusing on the inherent design limit of pressure rise per stage.",
        "Recall the characteristics of a single-stage axial compressor: Axial compressors achieve a relatively modest pressure rise per stage, typically around 1.15 to 1.25 (or 1.2:1), due to aerodynamic limitations such as flow diffusion, avoiding flow separation, and blade speed.",
        "Recall the characteristics of a single-stage centrifugal compressor: Centrifugal compressors can achieve a much higher pressure ratio per stage, often ranging from 4:1 to 10:1. This is due to the significant centrifugal effects and large diffusion achieved in the radial flow path, which provides a very effective means of pressure rise.",
        "Compare the single-stage pressure ratios: By comparing the typical values (Axial: $\\approx 1.15-1.25$ vs. Centrifugal: $\\approx 4-10$), it is evident that a single-stage centrifugal compressor provides a substantially higher pressure ratio than a single-stage axial compressor.",
        "Synthesize the conclusion: A single-stage centrifugal compressor can achieve a significantly higher pressure ratio than a single-stage axial compressor. Therefore, the pressure ratio of an axial compressor per stage is less than that of a centrifugal compressor per stage.",
        "Select the correct option: Based on the comparison, the option stating that the CPR of an axial compressor is less than the CPR of a centrifugal compressor is correct. Other options are incorrect as they contradict this fundamental difference or physical constraints."
