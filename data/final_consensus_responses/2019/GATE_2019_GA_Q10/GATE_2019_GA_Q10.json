      "reasoning": "The paragraph establishes a direct analogy: 'the prestige of a kingdom depended upon the number of taxes that it was able to levy on its people. It was very much like the prestige of a head-hunter in his own community.' This means that the factor determining the prestige of a kingdom (number of taxes) is analogous to the factor determining the prestige of a head-hunter. For a head-hunter, the equivalent of 'levying taxes' is 'gathering heads'. Therefore, the prestige of a head-hunter depended upon the number of heads he could gather. Option D directly reflects this analogy."

        "Identify the attribute of the kingdom (prestige depended on number of taxes levied) and recognize the phrase 'very much like' establishes a direct comparison to the head-hunter's prestige.",
        "Formulate the analogy structure: Kingdom's prestige : Number of Taxes :: Head-hunter's prestige : X. Then, determine the equivalent action for a head-hunter that parallels 'levying taxes' for a kingdom, which is 'gathering heads'.",
        "Complete the analogy by concluding that just as a kingdom's prestige was based on the number of taxes, a head-hunter's prestige would be based on the number of heads he could gather.",
        "Compare the derived conclusion with the given options, eliminating distractors that do not maintain the analogy's structure or focus on the wrong metric, and select the matching option."
