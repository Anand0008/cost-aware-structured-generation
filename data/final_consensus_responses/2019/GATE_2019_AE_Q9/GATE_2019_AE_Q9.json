      "reasoning": "Dynamic stability refers to an aircraft's ability to damp out oscillations and return to its equilibrium flight condition over time, following a disturbance. Conversely, dynamic instability means that after a disturbance, the aircraft's response will either grow unboundedly (diverge) or oscillate with increasing amplitude. Graph A shows a response that grows exponentially over time. This represents an unbounded increase in the perturbation, which is a direct characteristic of dynamic instability. Mathematically, this corresponds to a system with at least one characteristic root having a positive real part ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) > 0$), leading to a response term like $A \\cdot e^{\\lambda t}$ that grows with time. Graph B shows a response that decays exponentially to zero, representing an aperiodically stable system. Graph C shows a response that asymptotically approaches a constant value, indicating a stable system. Graph D shows an oscillatory response where the amplitude of oscillations decreases over time, characteristic of a dynamically stable, underdamped system. Therefore, Graph A, depicting exponential growth, is the correct representation of a dynamically unstable airplane's response."

        "Understand Dynamic Stability and Instability Concepts: Dynamic stability describes an aircraft's behavior over time after a disturbance. A dynamically stable aircraft will eventually return to its equilibrium state, with any oscillations decaying. A dynamically unstable aircraft, however, will see its response (e.g., angle of attack, speed) either grow unboundedly or oscillate with increasing amplitude.",
        "Recall Mathematical Forms of Dynamic Responses: Linear dynamic responses can be represented as $x(t)=A e^{\\lambda t}$ or $x(t)=A e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\omega t)$. The sign of $\\alpha$ (or the real part of $\\lambda$) determines whether the response grows or decays. If $\\alpha > 0$, the amplitude grows (unstable). If $\\alpha < 0$, the amplitude decays (stable). If $\\alpha = 0$, the amplitude remains constant (neutrally stable).",
        "Analyze Graph A: This graph shows a response that continuously increases and diverges from the equilibrium, exhibiting exponential growth. This behavior directly corresponds to the definition of dynamic instability, where the perturbation grows without bound ($\\alpha > 0$).",

Graph C shows a response that approaches a constant, non-zero value asymptotically, signifying a stable system that settles to a new equilibrium state. Graph D shows an oscillatory response where the amplitude of the oscillations decreases over time, which is characteristic behavior of a dynamically stable, underdamped system ($\\alpha < 0$ for the exponential envelope).
