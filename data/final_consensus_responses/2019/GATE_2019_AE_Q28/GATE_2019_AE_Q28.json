      "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement P (Incorrect):** Adverse yaw is not caused by flow separation due to large rudder deflection. Rudder deflection is primarily used to counteract adverse yaw, not to cause it.\n\n**Statement Q (Correct):** Adverse yaw is caused by dissimilar drag forces acting on the two halves of the wing resulting from aileron deflections. When a pilot initiates a roll, the downward-deflected aileron on one wing increases lift and consequently increases induced drag on that wing. Conversely, the upward-deflected aileron on the opposite wing decreases lift and induced drag. This differential drag creates a yawing moment that opposes the direction of the turn (i.e., yaws the nose away from the direction of the roll).\n\n**Statement R (Correct):** Adverse yaw can be mitigated or reduced by using differential ailerons. This design feature ensures that the upward deflection of one aileron is greater than the downward deflection of the opposite aileron for the same control input. This differential movement helps to balance the drag forces across the wings, thereby reducing or compensating for the adverse yawing moment.\n\nSince statements Q and R are correct, option D is the correct answer."

        "Step 3: Evaluate statement Q. Statement Q correctly describes the mechanism of adverse yaw. When ailerons are deflected for a roll, the down-going aileron on one wing increases lift and, consequently, induced drag. The up-going aileron on the other wing decreases lift and induced drag. This differential drag creates a yawing moment that opposes the intended turn.",
        "Step 4: Evaluate statement R. Statement R correctly identifies differential ailerons as a mitigation technique. Differential ailerons are designed such that the upward deflection is greater than the downward deflection, which helps to balance the drag forces and reduce the adverse yawing moment.",
