      "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the critical buckling load for a truss. First, the geometry of the truss is analyzed: given BC = 10 cm and base angles of 45 degrees, the triangle ABC is an isosceles right-angled triangle. The length of members AB and AC is calculated as $L = 5\\sqrt{2}$ cm. Next, a force analysis at joint A (where load P is applied) reveals that members AB and AC are in compression, each carrying a force of $F_{AB} = F_{AC} = P/\\sqrt{2}$. Member BC is in tension and thus will not buckle. Using Euler's buckling formula for pinned-pinned columns ($K=1$), the critical compressive force for members AB and AC is calculated as $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$. Substituting the given values ($E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$, $I = 0.1 \\text{ cm}^4 = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$, and $L = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm} = 0.07071 \\text{ m}$), $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(0.07071 \\text{ m})^2} \\approx 394784 \\text{ N} = 394.78 \\text{ kN}$. For the truss to fail, the force in a member must reach its critical buckling load. Thus, $P/\\sqrt{2} = F_{cr}$, which yields $P = F_{cr} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 394.78 \\text{ kN} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 558.38 \\text{ kN}$. Rounding to the nearest integer gives $558 \\text{ kN}$."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "1. **Analyze Truss Geometry and Member Lengths**: The truss is an isosceles triangle with base BC = 10 cm and base angles of 45 degrees. This implies the angle at A is 90 degrees. The length of members AB and AC can be calculated using trigonometry: $L_{AB} = L_{AC} = \\frac{BC/2}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{5 \\text{ cm}}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm}$. Convert this to meters: $L = 5\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m} \\approx 0.07071 \\text{ m}$.\n2. **Perform Force Analysis at Joint A**: A vertical load P is applied at joint A. Due to symmetry, the compressive forces in members AB and AC are equal. Member BC is in tension and will not buckle. Resolve forces vertically at joint A: $2 F_{AB} \\sin 45^\\circ = P$. Therefore, the compressive force in each inclined member is $F_{AB} = F_{AC} = \\frac{P}{2 \\sin 45^\\circ} = \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n3. **Calculate the Euler Critical Buckling Load for a Single Member**: Use Euler's buckling formula for a pin-ended column ($K=1$): $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$.\n   *   Convert given values to consistent SI units:\n       *   Young's modulus $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$.\n       *   Moment of inertia $I = 0.1 \\text{ cm}^4 = 0.1 \\times (10^{-2} \\text{ m})^4 = 0.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}^4 = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$.\n   *   Substitute the values: $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4)}{(0.07071 \\text{ m})^2} \\approx \\frac{1973.92}{0.005} \\approx 394784 \\text{ N} \\approx 394.78 \\text{ kN}$.\n4. **Determine the Load P at which the Truss Fails**: The truss fails when the compressive force in an inclined member reaches its critical buckling load. Set $F_{AB} = F_{cr}$:\n   *   $\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{2}} = 394.78 \\text{ kN}$\n   *   $P = 394.78 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 558.38 \\text{ kN}$.\n5. **Round to the Nearest Integer**: The lowest value of load P at which the truss fails due to buckling, rounded to the nearest integer, is 558 kN.",
        "Identify which members are in compression and thus susceptible to buckling. For the given truss, members AB and AC are in compression. Determine their length based on the truss geometry.",
        "Perform force analysis at joint A using equilibrium equations. Due to symmetry, the axial forces in members AB and AC are equal. Summing forces in the vertical direction: $2 F_{AB} \\sin(45^\\circ) = P$. This simplifies to $F_{AB} = P/\\sqrt{2}$.",
        "Apply Euler's Critical Buckling Load Formula. For a pin-ended column, the effective length factor $K=1$. The critical buckling force ($F_{cr}$) for a member is given by $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$.",
        "Calculate the critical buckling force for a single member. Convert given values to consistent SI units: $E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2$ and $I = 0.1 \\text{ cm}^4 = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^4$. Assuming the member length $L = 0.07071 \\text{ m}$, substitute these into Euler's formula: $F_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (200 \\times 10^9) (1 \\times 10^{-9})}{(0.07071)^2} \\approx 394.78 \\text{ kN}$.",
        "Determine the external load P at which the truss buckles. Buckling occurs when the compressive force in a member reaches its critical value, so $F_{AB} = F_{cr}$. Therefore, $P/\\sqrt{2} = 394.78 \\text{ kN}$, which implies $P = 394.78 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 558.38 \\text{ kN}$.",
