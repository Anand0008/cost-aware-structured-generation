      "confidence": 0.96,
      "confidence_type": "single_model",
      "reasoning": "The passage states that 'banking institutions have been making a demand to reduce interest rates on small saving schemes' and 'Finally, the government announced yesterday a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes'. This sequence of events directly supports the inference that the government's decision was influenced by, or at least followed, the demands of banking institutions. Therefore, option C, 'The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions before reducing the interest rates on small saving schemes,' is a cautious and accurate inference because the passage describes one such instance, making 'sometimes' appropriate.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they use absolute terms like 'whenever,' 'always,' and 'only,' which are not supported by the single instance described in the passage. The passage does not imply an automatic or exclusive causal relationship, nor does it state that rates were always on par with fixed deposits."
    },
    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Read the passage carefully and extract the sequence of events and stated facts: RBI reduced the repo rate, banking institutions demanded a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes, and the government reduced those rates to bring them on par with fixed deposit rates.",
        "Understand the question: It asks which statement can be *inferred* from the passage. An inference must be directly supported by the information given, not an assumption or an absolute generalization.",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'Whenever the Reserve Bank of India reduces the repo rate, the interest rates on small saving schemes are also reduced.' The passage describes only one instance and shows a delay and an intervening demand, so 'whenever' is an overgeneralization and not directly supported.",
        "Evaluate Option B: 'Interest rates on small saving schemes are always maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates.' The phrase 'to bring them on par' explicitly indicates they were *not* on par previously, making 'always maintained on par' false.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions before reducing the interest rates on small saving schemes.' The passage states that banking institutions made demands, and *finally* the government acted. This directly supports the idea that the government *did* consider these demands in this instance, and 'sometimes' is a valid, cautious inference.",
        "Evaluate Option D: 'A reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follow only after a reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India.' The word 'only' makes this too restrictive. While a repo rate reduction occurred, the banking demands were also a factor, and the passage doesn't exclude other potential triggers. This cannot be inferred as the *sole* condition.",
        "Conclude that Option C is the only statement that can be logically and accurately inferred from the given passage without making unsupported assumptions or generalizations."
