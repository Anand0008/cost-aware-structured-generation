Integrate both sides: $\\int \\frac{1}{y^2} dy = \\int dx$\n3.  Perform integration: $-\\frac{1}{y} = x + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n4.  Use the initial condition: The curve passes through $(1, -1)$. Substitute $x=1$ and $y=-1$ into the equation:\n    $-\\frac{1}{(-1)} = 1 + C$\n    $1 = 1 + C$\n    $C = 0$\n5.  Write the particular solution: Substitute $C=0$ back into the integrated equation:\n    $-\\frac{1}{y} = x$\n    $y = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n6.  Evaluate $y$ at $x = -2$: Substitute $x=-2$ into the particular solution:\n    $y(-2) = -\\frac{1}{(-2)} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n7.
