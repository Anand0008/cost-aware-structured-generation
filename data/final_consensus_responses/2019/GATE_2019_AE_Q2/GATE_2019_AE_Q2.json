The rotation is 90 degrees about the $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ (z-axis). A counter-clockwise rotation is assumed by convention (right-hand rule).

Substituting these values:\n$R_z(90^\\circ) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nTo find the rotated vector $\\mathbf{b}$, we multiply the rotation matrix by the initial vector $\\mathbf{a}$:\n$\\mathbf{b} = R_z(90^\\circ) \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(1) + (-1)(1) + (0)(0) \\\\ (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThus, the rotated vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is $-\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.
