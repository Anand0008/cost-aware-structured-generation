      "reasoning": "The problem involves finding the natural frequencies of a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system. This is achieved by formulating the mass matrix ([M]) and stiffness matrix ([K]) from the equations of motion, and then solving the eigenvalue problem det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0. For the given system, assuming rightward displacements x1 and x2 from equilibrium, the mass matrix is [M] = [[m, 0], [0, m]] and the stiffness matrix is [K] = [[3k, -2k], [-2k, 3k]]. Solving the characteristic equation (3k - m\\omega^2)^2 - (2k)^2 = 0 yields two natural frequencies: \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{k/m} and \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5k/m}. Substituting the given values k = 1250 N/m and m = 10 kg into the expression for the highest natural frequency \\omega_2 gives \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5 * 1250 / 10} = \\sqrt{625} = 25 radians/s. This matches the provided correct answer."

        "Step 1: Identify the system as a 2-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DOF) system with two identical masses m = 10 kg and three springs (left stiffness k = 1250 N/m, middle stiffness 2k, right stiffness k). Define the displacements of the two masses as x_1 and x_2 from their equilibrium positions.",
        "Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law to each mass to derive the equations of motion. For mass 1: m\\ddot{x}_1 = -k x_1 - 2k (x_1 - x_2). For mass 2: m\\ddot{x}_2 = -k x_2 - 2k (x_2 - x_1). Rearrange these into standard form: m\\ddot{x}_1 + (k+2k)x_1 - 2kx_2 = 0  => m\\ddot{x}_1 + 3kx_1 - 2kx_2 = 0 and m\\ddot{x}_2 - 2kx_1 + (k+2k)x_2 = 0 => m\\ddot{x}_2 - 2kx_1 + 3kx_2 = 0.",
        "Formulate the equations of motion (EOM) in matrix form: $[M]\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} + [K]\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $[M]$ is the mass matrix, $[K]$ is the stiffness matrix, and $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2\\}^T$ is the displacement vector.",
        "For the given system, the mass matrix is $[M] = \\begin{bmatrix} m & 0 \\\\ 0 & m \\end{bmatrix}$ and the stiffness matrix is $[K] = \\begin{bmatrix} 3k & -2k \\\\ -2k & 3k \\end{bmatrix}$. Assume harmonic motion, $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{X}e^{i\\omega t}$, to transform the EOM into an algebraic eigenvalue problem: $([K] - \\omega^2[M])\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{0}$.",
        "To find the natural frequencies, set the determinant of the dynamic stiffness matrix to zero for a non-trivial solution: $\\det([K] - \\omega^2[M]) = 0$. This yields the characteristic equation: $(3k - m\\omega^2)^2 - (-2k)^2 = 0$.",
        "Solve the characteristic equation for $\\omega^2$: $(3k - m\\omega^2)^2 - (2k)^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $(3k - m\\omega^2 - 2k)(3k - m\\omega^2 + 2k) = 0$, which gives $(k - m\\omega^2)(5k - m\\omega^2) = 0$.",
        "From the simplified characteristic equation, we get two solutions for $\\omega^2$: $m\\omega^2 = k$ and $m\\omega^2 = 5k$. Therefore, the two natural frequencies are $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{k/m}$ and $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5k/m}$.",
        "Identify the highest natural frequency, which is $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{5k/m}$.",
