      "reasoning": "The complete combustion of 1 mole of ethanol (C2H5OH) requires 3 moles of oxygen (O2). The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of ethanol is: C2H5OH + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. This is derived by ensuring atom conservation (C, H, O) through the following steps:\n1. Start with the unbalanced equation: $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n2. Balance Carbon (C): There are 2 C atoms on the left, so we need 2 CO2 on the right.\n   $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n3. Balance Hydrogen (H): There are $5+1=6$ H atoms on the left, so we need 3 H2O on the right ($3 \\times 2 = 6$).\n   $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2 + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n4. Balance Oxygen (O):\n   - Oxygen atoms on the product side: $(2 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 1) = 4 + 3 = 7$ atoms.\n   - Oxygen atoms already present in ethanol (C2H5OH) on the reactant side: 1 atom.\n   - Remaining oxygen atoms needed from O2: $7 - 1 = 6$ atoms.\n   - Since O2 is diatomic, the number of moles of O2 required is $6 / 2 = 3$ moles.\nThus, the balanced equation is: $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2 + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. The required number of moles of oxygen is 3."
