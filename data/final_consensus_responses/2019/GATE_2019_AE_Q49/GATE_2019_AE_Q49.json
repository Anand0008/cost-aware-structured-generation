      "reasoning": "The problem involves a rigid slab supported by three cables of identical length (L) and cross-sectional area (A). The central cable is steel (Young's modulus = 3E), and the two outer cables are aluminum (Young's modulus = E).\n1.  **Strain Compatibility:** Since the slab is rigid and remains horizontal, and all cables have the same initial length, their elongations ($\\Delta L$) must be equal. Therefore, the axial strain ($\\epsilon = \\Delta L / L$) in all cables must be the same.\n    $\\epsilon_s = \\epsilon_a = \\epsilon$\n2.  **Stress-Strain Relationship (Hooke's Law) and Force:**\n    The axial force in a cable is given by $P = \\sigma A = (E \\epsilon) A = EA \\epsilon$.\n    This implies that for equal strain ($\\epsilon$), the force in each cable is proportional to its axial stiffness ($EA$).\n    For the central steel cable: $P_s = E_s A \\epsilon = (3E) A \\epsilon = 3EA \\epsilon$\n    For each aluminum cable: $P_a = E_a A \\epsilon = (E) A \\epsilon = EA \\epsilon$\n3.  **Force Equilibrium:** The total weight $W$ is supported by one steel cable and two aluminum cables.\n    $W = P_s + 2 P_a$\n    $W = (3EA \\epsilon) + 2 (EA \\epsilon)$\n    $W = 5EA \\epsilon$\n4.  **Calculate the force in the central cable ($P_s$):**\n    From step 2, $P_s = 3EA \\epsilon$.\n    From step 3, we have $EA \\epsilon = W/5$.\n    Substitute this into the expression for $P_s$:\n    $P_s = 3 (W/5) = \\frac{3}{5} W$\n5.  **Calculate the percentage of total weight taken by the central cable:**\n    Percentage $= \\frac{P_s}{W} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5} W}{W} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 100\\% = 0.6 \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$.\nThus, the central cable carries 60% of the total weight."

        "Identify the given parameters: a rigid slab supported by three cables of identical length (L) and cross-sectional area (A). The central cable has Young's modulus 3E, and the two outer cables have Young's modulus E. The total weight is W. Since the slab is rigid and remains horizontal, all three cables experience the same vertical displacement and thus the same elongation ($\\delta$).",
        "Apply the axial elongation formula, $\\delta = \\frac{PL}{EA}$, to each cable. Since L and A are identical for all cables and $\\delta$ is the same for all, the compatibility condition implies $\\frac{P_s}{E_s} = \\frac{P_{al}}{E_{al}}$.",
        "Substitute the given Young's moduli ($E_s = 3E$ for the central cable and $E_{al} = E$ for the outer cables) into the compatibility equation: $\\frac{P_s}{3E} = \\frac{P_{al}}{E}$. This simplifies to $P_s = 3P_{al}$.",
        "Apply the principle of force equilibrium. The total weight W is supported by the central steel cable ($P_s$) and the two outer aluminum cables ($2P_{al}$). So, $W = P_s + 2P_{al}$.",
        "Substitute the relationship $P_s = 3P_{al}$ (from Step 2) into the equilibrium equation (from Step 3): $W = (3P_{al}) + 2P_{al} = 5P_{al}$. Solve for $P_{al}$: $P_{al} = W/5$.",
        "Now, find the force in the central steel cable, $P_s$, using $P_s = 3P_{al}$: $P_s = 3(W/5) = 3W/5$.",
