      "reasoning": "The question asks about the characteristics of a NACA2415 airfoil. According to the NACA Four-Digit Series nomenclature:\n1.  **First Digit (2):** Represents the maximum camber as a percentage of the chord. So, for NACA2415, the maximum camber is 2% of the chord, which is `0.02c`.\n2.  **Second Digit (4):** Represents the location of the maximum camber from the leading edge, in tenths of the chord. So, for NACA2415, the maximum camber is located at `0.4c` from the leading edge.\n3.  **Third and Fourth Digits (15):** Represent the maximum thickness as a percentage of the chord. So, for NACA2415, the maximum thickness is 15% of the chord, which is `0.15c`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A. Maximum camber is located at 0.2c from the leading edge.** This is incorrect. The location of maximum camber is `0.4c`.\n*   **B. Maximum thickness is located at 0.15c from the leading edge.** This is incorrect. `0.15c` is the *value* of the maximum thickness, not its location. The NACA 4-digit series does not directly specify the location of maximum thickness, though it's typically around `0.3c` to `0.4c` for these airfoils.\n*   **C. Maximum camber is 0.02c.** This is correct, as derived from the first digit '2' (2% of chord).\n*   **D. Maximum thickness is 0.05c.** This is incorrect. The maximum thickness is `0.15c`.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct statement."
