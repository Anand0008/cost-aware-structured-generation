While a general anisotropic material can have up to 21 independent elastic constants, the high degree of symmetry in an isotropic material significantly reduces this number. Due to the material's properties being identical in all directions, only two independent elastic constants are required to fully describe its elastic behavior. Common pairs of these constants include Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio (\\nu), or Shear Modulus (G) and Bulk Modulus (K)."

        "Step 6: Recognize that for isotropic materials, only 2 independent elastic constants remain. Examples include Young's Modulus (E) and Poisson's Ratio (\\nu). All other constants (like G, K) can be expressed in terms of these two."
