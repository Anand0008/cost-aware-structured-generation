      "reasoning": "The sentence requires a past participle to complete the passive voice construction 'had never been ______'. The structure 'had been + past participle' is used to form the past perfect passive tense. 'Defeated' is the past participle of the verb 'to defeat', making option A grammatically correct and semantically appropriate in the context of a competition like kabaddi, implying India had not experienced a loss until Iran's arrival. Options B ('defeating') is a present participle, C ('defeat') is the base form, and D ('defeatist') is an adjective, all of which are grammatically or contextually incorrect."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Analyze the sentence structure: The phrase \"India had never been ______________ in kabaddi\" contains \"had never been\", indicating a past perfect passive voice construction. This structure requires a past participle (V3) to complete the verb phrase.",
        "Understand the context: The sentence implies that India was previously undefeated in kabaddi until Iran's arrival changed that status. The blank needs a word that conveys the action of losing or being beaten.",
        "Evaluate the grammatical and semantic fit of each option:",
        "Option A: \"defeated\" is the past participle (V3) of \"to defeat\". It correctly forms the passive voice \"had never been defeated,\" meaning India had not experienced defeat. This fits both grammatically and contextually.",
        "Option B: \"defeating\" is the present participle (V-ing form). This would imply India was actively performing the action of defeating, which contradicts the context of India's record and the passive structure.",
        "Option C: \"defeat\" is the base form of the verb or a noun. It is grammatically incorrect after \"been\" in this passive construction.",
        "Option D: \"defeatist\" is an adjective meaning characterized by acceptance of defeat. It describes a mindset, not the outcome of a match, and does not fit the grammatical requirement for a verb form in the passive voice.",
        "Conclusion: Based on grammatical rules for the past perfect passive voice and the contextual meaning, \"defeated\" is the only correct option.",
