      "reasoning": "For a propeller-driven aircraft, endurance at constant altitude and constant CL and CD is given by the Breguet endurance equation. The key challenge is the correct interpretation and conversion of the specific fuel consumption (SFC) units. While given as kg/kW-hr (mass-specific), for GATE and consistency with standard aeronautical formulas (like Anderson's), it's often treated numerically as weight-specific fuel consumption (N/kW-hr) and then converted to consistent units (e.g., 1/m). Using this weight-based SFC, the Breguet equation is applied to solve for the final weight (W1) after 18 hours. The fuel weight is then calculated as the difference between the initial gross take-off weight (W0) and the final weight (W1). The calculated value of approximately 1477 N falls within the typical acceptable range for such problems (1440-1490 N)."

        "Identify the governing equation, the Breguet endurance formula for propeller-driven aircraft, and list all given parameters: initial gross weight ($W_0 = 4905 \\text{ N}$), wing area ($S = 6.84 \\text{ m}^2$), maximum aerodynamic efficiency ratio ($(C_L^{3/2}/C_D)_{\\text{max}} = 13$), propeller efficiency ($\\eta = 0.9$), mass-specific fuel consumption ($c_m = 0.76 \\text{ kg/kW-hr}$), air density ($\\rho = 1.225 \\text{ kg/m}^3$), acceleration due to gravity ($g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$), and desired endurance ($E = 18 \\text{ hours}$). The formula is $E = \\frac{\\eta}{c} \\frac{C_L^{3/2}}{C_D} \\sqrt{2 \\rho S} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W_1}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W_0}} \\right)$.",

First, convert to weight basis: $c_{\\text{weight}} = c_m \\times g = 0.76 \\times 9.81 = 7.4556 \\text{ N/kW-hr}$. Then, convert kW-hr to N-m (Joules) using $1 \\text{ kW-hr} = 3.6 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N-m}$. So, $c = \\frac{7.4556 \\text{ N/kW-hr}}{3.6 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N-m/kW-hr}} = 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ 1/m}$.",
