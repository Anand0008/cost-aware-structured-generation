This relationship can be expressed as: $$ C_{N\\beta, \\text{tail}} \\propto S_v \\cdot l_v $$ Given the modifications:\n1.  The vertical tail area ($S_v$) is increased by 20%. Therefore, the modified area is $S_{v, \\text{modified}} = S_{v, \\text{original}} \\times (1 + 0.20) = 1.20 \\cdot S_{v, \\text{original}}$.\n2.  The moment arm ($l_v$) is decreased by 20%. Therefore, the modified moment arm is $l_{v, \\text{modified}} = l_{v, \\text{original}} \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 \\cdot l_{v, \\text{original}}$.\n\nTo find the ratio of the modified to the original directional static stability, we set up the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{C_{N\\beta, \\text{modified}}}{C_{N\\beta, \\text{original}}} = \\frac{S_{v, \\text{modified}} \\cdot l_{v, \\text{modified}}}{S_{v, \\text{original}} \\cdot l_{v, \\text{original}}} $$\nSubstitute the expressions for the modified area and moment arm:\n$$ \\frac{C_{N\\beta, \\text{modified}}}{C_{N\\beta, \\text{original}}} = \\frac{(1.20 \\cdot S_{v, \\text{original}}) \\cdot (0.80 \\cdot l_{v, \\text{original}})}{S_{v, \\text{original}} \\cdot l_{v, \\text{original}}} $$\nCancel out the original terms ($S_{v, \\text{original}}$ and $l_{v, \\text{original}}$):\n$$ \\frac{C_{N\\beta, \\text{modified}}}{C_{N\\beta, \\text{original}}} = 1.20 \\times 0.80 $$\n$$ \\frac{C_{N\\beta, \\text{modified}}}{C_{N\\beta, \\text{original}}} = 0.96 $$\nThe ratio of the modified to the original directional static stability is 0.96."

        "Using the proportionality $C_{N\\beta, \\text{tail}} \\propto S_v \\cdot l_v$, compute the ratio of the modified directional static stability to the original stability: $\\frac{C_{N_{\\beta, tail}}^{\\prime}}{C_{N_{\\beta, tail}}} = \\frac{S_v' \\cdot l_v'}{S_v \\cdot l_v}$.",
        "Substitute the modified values into the ratio: $\\frac{C_{N_{\\beta, tail}}^{\\prime}}{C_{N_{\\beta, tail}}} = \\frac{(1.2 S_v) \\cdot (0.8 l_v)}{S_v \\cdot l_v} = 1.2 \\times 0.8 = 0.96$.",

For instance, if the center of gravity location ($h$) is constrained by payload requirements, the tail volume ratio ($V_H$) can be adjusted to achieve the desired level of static stability.
