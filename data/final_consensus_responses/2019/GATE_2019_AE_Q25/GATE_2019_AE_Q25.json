      "reasoning": "The system shown in the figure consists of a mass `m` connected to three springs, each with stiffness `k`. The two springs on the left are connected in series between the left fixed wall and the mass. The third spring on the right is connected between the mass and the right fixed wall.\n\n1.  **Equivalent stiffness of springs in series:** The two springs on the left, each with stiffness `k`, are in series. Their equivalent stiffness, `k_series`, is given by:\n    `$\\frac{1}{k_{series}} = \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{2}{k}$`\n    `$k_{series} = \\frac{k}{2}$`\n\n2.  **Total equivalent stiffness:** Now, the mass `m` is effectively connected to `k_series` on its left and `k` (the third spring) on its right. When springs are connected on opposite sides of a mass and both resist its motion, they act in parallel. Therefore, the total equivalent stiffness, `k_eq`, is:\n    `$k_{eq} = k_{series} + k = \\frac{k}{2} + k = \\frac{3k}{2}$`\n\n3.  **Substitute given values:**\n    `$m = 3 \\text{ kg}$`\n    `$k = 20 \\text{ kN/m} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}$`\n    `$k_{eq} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times (20 \\times 10^3) = 30 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}$`\n\n4.  **Calculate natural angular frequency ($\\omega_n$):**\n    `$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eq}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/m}}{3 \\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ rad}^2/\\text{s}^2} = \\sqrt{10000} \\text{ rad/s} = 100 \\text{ rad/s}$`\n\n5.  **Calculate natural frequency (f_n) in Hz:**\n    `$f_n = \\frac{\\omega_n}{2\\pi} = \\frac{100 \\text{ rad/s}}{2\\pi \\text{ rad}} \\approx \\frac{100}{6.28318} \\text{ Hz} \\approx 15.915 \\text{ Hz}$`\n\n6.  **Round off to the nearest integer:**\n    `$f_n \\approx 16 \\text{ Hz}$`"

        "description": "This method, also known as Rayleigh's Method, equates the maximum kinetic energy (T_max) of the system to its maximum potential energy (U_max) during free vibration. By assuming simple harmonic motion, expressions for maximum kinetic and potential energy are formulated as $T_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} m (A \\omega_n)^2$ and $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2$, respectively. Equating these, $T_{max} = U_{max}$, directly yields the system's natural frequency, $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Can be simpler for complex systems where deriving equations of motion is difficult; does not require solving differential equations; provides good physical intuition through energy conservation. Cons: Requires the assumption of Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM); for very simple systems, it can be slower than direct formula application; requires correctly identifying maximum displacement and velocity.",
        "when_to_use": "Useful for deriving natural frequency for conservative systems, especially when equations of motion are cumbersome or hard to derive directly, such as systems with varying mass or stiffness distribution. For simple problems, it's an alternative but not necessarily more efficient."
