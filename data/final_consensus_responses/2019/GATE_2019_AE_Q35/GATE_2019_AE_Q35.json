      "reasoning": "The problem involves a fluid in a cylindrical container rotating at a constant angular speed, causing the free surface to take a parabolic shape. A key principle for such systems, derived from the conservation of fluid volume, is that the initial undisturbed free surface height (h0) is exactly halfway between the minimum height (at the center, r=0) and the maximum height (at the wall, r=R) of the paraboloid. Let the maximum height of the free surface be z_max = h0 + h1 (at r=R), and the minimum height be z_min = h0 - h2 (at r=0). According to the volume conservation principle for a paraboloid of revolution, the original free surface level h0 is the average of z_max and z_min. Thus, h0 = (z_max + z_min) / 2. Substituting the expressions for z_max and z_min: h0 = ((h0 + h1) + (h0 - h2)) / 2. This simplifies to 2h0 = 2h0 + h1 - h2, which means 0 = h1 - h2, or h1 = h2. Given h1 = 10 cm, the downward displacement h2 must also be 10 cm."

From the parabolic equation, the height difference between the wall and the center is $\\frac{\\omega^2 R^2}{2g} = h_1 + h_2$.",
        "Apply the principle of conservation of fluid volume. For a paraboloid of revolution formed by a rotating fluid, the initial undisturbed free surface height $h_0$ is exactly halfway between the minimum height ($z_{min}$) at the center and the maximum height ($z_{max}$) at the container wall. Thus, $h_0 = \\frac{z_{max} + z_{min}}{2}$.",

Cons: More time-consuming, requires more mathematical sophistication (calculus and integration), and involves more complex calculations compared to directly applying geometric properties.",
