      "reasoning": "The correct bending moment diagram is option A. For a simply supported beam, the bending moment at the supports (P and R) must be zero, which is shown in diagram A. A concentrated vertical load causes a linear variation in the bending moment, and a concentrated moment causes a sudden jump in the bending moment diagram. Diagram A shows a linear increase in bending moment from 0 at the left support to 100 Nm just before the center (Q). This implies a constant positive shear force in the left half of the beam. At the center (Q), a concentrated clockwise bending moment of 100 Nm is applied. This causes a sudden drop of 100 Nm in the bending moment diagram, bringing the moment from 100 Nm to 0 Nm at Q. For the right half of the beam (from Q to R), the bending moment is shown as zero, implying zero shear force in this segment. This overall shape is consistent with the qualitative effects of the applied point load and concentrated moment, leading to the specific values shown in diagram A.",

The diagram shows $M_c$ as a clockwise moment.\n\n*   **Sum of vertical forces:**\n    $\\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B - P = 0 \\implies R_A + R_B = 200 \\text{ N"

        "Identify given data: Beam length L = 1 m. Concentrated vertical load P = 200 N downwards at center (x=0.5 m). Concentrated bending moment M_app = 100 Nm at center. Supports: simply supported (pin at left, roller at right).",
        "Calculate support reactions. Let R_A be the left reaction (up positive) and R_B be the right reaction (up positive). Assume the applied moment M_app = 100 Nm is counter-clockwise (positive). Use equilibrium equations: Sum of vertical forces = 0 => R_A + R_B - 200 = 0. Sum of moments about left support = 0 => R_B * 1 - 200*0.5 + 100 = 0. Solving these yields R_B = 0 N and R_A = 200 N.",
        "Derive bending moment equation piecewise. For 0 \\u2264 x < 0.5 m (left of center), M(x) = R_A * x = 200x. At x=0.5- (just left of center), M = 200*0.5 = 100 Nm.

        "Observe the discontinuity: A concentrated moment causes an instantaneous jump in the bending moment diagram equal to its magnitude. At x=0.5m, the moment drops from 100 Nm (just left) to 0 Nm (just right), which is a jump of 100 Nm, matching the applied moment.",
        "Interpret the bending moment diagram: The BMD starts at 0 at the left support (x=0), increases linearly to 100 Nm at the center (x=0.5m), then drops vertically to 0 Nm at the center due to the applied couple, and remains zero up to the right support (x=1m). The supports are simple, so M_P = M_R = 0, which is satisfied by this diagram.",
        "Thus, the BMD must start at 0 at the left support, increase linearly to a peak of 100 Nm at the center, then drop vertically to 0 at the center due to the applied couple, and remain zero up to the right support. This shape corresponds to option A."
