      "reasoning": "The sentence requires a relative pronoun that refers to 'the fishermen' and acts as the object of the preposition 'to'. The phrase implies 'the flood victims owed their lives to the fishermen'. In English grammar, 'whom' is the objective case for people and is used after prepositions. 'To whom' correctly forms the prepositional phrase that modifies 'owed'.\n\n- Option A ('whom'): While 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun for people, it is missing the necessary preposition 'to'. The verb 'owed' in this context implies 'owed to someone'.\n- Option B ('to which'): 'Which' is used for things or animals, not people. 'The fishermen' are people.\n- Option C ('to whom'): This is correct. 'To' is the necessary preposition, and 'whom' is the objective relative pronoun for people, correctly referring to 'the fishermen' as the indirect object of the verb 'owed'.\n- Option D ('that'): 'That' can be used as a relative pronoun for people or things, but it generally does not follow a preposition in this specific construction (e.g., you wouldn't say 'to that'). While 'that' can sometimes replace 'whom' in informal speech, it's not grammatically correct after a preposition in formal writing or for an indirect object in this manner."

      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify the core structure of the sentence and its key elements: 'The fishermen, _______ the flood victims owed their lives, were rewarded by the government.' The embedded clause '_______ the flood victims owed their lives' describes 'The fishermen'.",
        "Determine the grammatical function of the blank. In the clause 'the flood victims owed their lives', 'their lives' is the direct object. The fishermen are the recipients of the action, meaning the victims owed their lives *to* the fishermen. This implies the blank represents the indirect object, requiring a preposition 'to'.",
        "Select the appropriate relative pronoun. The antecedent 'The fishermen' is human and functions as the object of the implied preposition 'to'. Therefore, the objective relative pronoun for people, 'whom', is required.",
        "Apply the 'he/him' test: If you can replace the pronoun with 'he', use 'who'; if with 'him', use 'whom'. In the implied clause 'the flood victims owed their lives to him', 'him' fits, confirming 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun. Furthermore, in formal English, the preposition 'to' typically precedes the relative pronoun, forming 'to whom'.",
        "Combine the necessary preposition and the correct relative pronoun. Since 'to' is required for the indirect object relationship and 'whom' is the correct objective pronoun for people, the grammatically correct choice is 'to whom'.",
        "Evaluate the given options. Option C, 'to whom', aligns with the grammatical rules identified. Options A ('whom'), B ('to which'), and D ('that') are incorrect because A lacks the preposition, B is for non-human antecedents, and D cannot directly follow a preposition in this formal context."
