      "reasoning": "The question asks for the change in vehicle velocity (Delta u) given specific impulse (I_sp), burnout mass, and propellant mass. The governing equation is the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation (ideal rocket equation): $\\Delta u = V_e \\ln(m_0/m_b)$, where $V_e$ is the effective exhaust velocity. The specific impulse is given in non-standard units of Ns/kg. This unit is dimensionally equivalent to m/s and represents the effective exhaust velocity $V_e$. Therefore, $V_e = I_{sp} = 3000 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The initial mass $m_0$ is burnout mass plus propellant mass: $1000 \\, \\text{kg} + 720 \\, \\text{kg} = 1720 \\, \\text{kg}$. The final mass $m_b$ is $1000 \\, \\text{kg}$. The mass ratio is $1720/1000 = 1.72$. Thus, $\\Delta u = 3000 \\times \\ln(1.72)$. $\\ln(1.72) \\approx 0.542324$. So, $\\Delta u \\approx 3000 \\times 0.542324 = 1626.972 \\, \\text{m/s} = 1.626972 \\, \\text{km/s} \\approx 1.63 \\, \\text{km/s}$ when rounded to two decimal places. This matches the provided answer key range of 1.60 to 1.65 km/s."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle and given parameters. The problem asks for the change in vehicle velocity ($\\Delta u$) for a rocket, neglecting velocity losses. This is governed by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: $\\Delta u = V_e \\ln(m_0 / m_b)$. Given parameters are specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) = 3000 Ns/kg, mass of rocket at burnout ($m_b$) = 1000 kg, and propellant consumed ($m_p$) = 720 kg.",
        "Step 2: Interpret the specific impulse and calculate initial mass. The specific impulse given as 3000 Ns/kg is dimensionally equivalent to m/s, representing the effective exhaust velocity ($V_e$). So, $V_e = 3000$ m/s. Calculate the initial mass ($m_0$) of the rocket: $m_0 = m_b + m_p = 1000 \\text{ kg} + 720 \\text{ kg} = 1720 \\text{ kg}$.",
        "Step 3: Apply the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation and compute the result. Substitute the values into the rocket equation: $\\Delta u = 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1720 \\text{ kg}}{1000 \\text{ kg}}\\right) = 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\ln(1.72)$. Calculate $\\ln(1.72) \\approx 0.542324$. Thus, $\\Delta u \\approx 3000 \\text{ m/s} \\times 0.542324 \\approx 1626.972 \\text{ m/s}$. Convert to km/s and round off: $\\Delta u = 1.626972 \\text{ km/s} \\approx 1.63 \\text{ km/s}$.",
        "Step 4: Identify the final mass $m_b$. This is the burnout mass, given as $1000 \\, \\text{kg}$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the mass ratio. $m_0 / m_b = 1720 / 1000 = 1.72$.",
        "Step 6: Compute the natural logarithm. $\\ln(1.72) \\approx 0.542324$ (use calculator or approximation: $\\ln(1.72) = \\ln(172/100) = \\ln(172) - \\ln(100) \\approx 5.1475 - 4.6052 = 0.5423$).",
        "Step 7: Calculate the velocity change in m/s. $\\Delta u = V_e \\cdot \\ln(m_0/m_b) = 3000 \\times 0.542324 = 1626.972 \\, \\text{m/s}$.",
        "Step 8: Convert to km/s and round. $1626.972 \\, \\text{m/s} = 1.626972 \\, \\text{km/s} \\approx 1.63 \\, \\text{km/s}$ (rounded to two decimal places)."
