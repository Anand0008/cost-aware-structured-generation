      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the azimuthal location ($\\theta$) on the cylinder surface where the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) is zero. For inviscid, incompressible flow, the pressure coefficient is given by Bernoulli's equation as $C_p = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2$, where $V_s$ is the magnitude of the velocity on the surface of the cylinder and $U$ is the free stream speed.\n\n1.  **Identify velocity on the cylinder surface**: The given velocity components are $u_r = U\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right)\\cos\\theta$ and $u_\\theta = -U\\left(1 + \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right)\\sin\\theta$. On the surface of the cylinder, the radial coordinate is $r = R$.\n    *   Substitute $r=R$ into $u_r$: $u_r(r=R) = U\\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right)\\cos\\theta = U(1-1)\\cos\\theta = 0$. This confirms that the radial velocity is zero at the surface, as expected for a solid body in inviscid flow.\n    *   Substitute $r=R$ into $u_\\theta$: $u_\\theta(r=R) = -U\\left(1 + \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right)\\sin\\theta = -U(1+1)\\sin\\theta = -2U\\sin\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the magnitude of surface velocity**: The total velocity on the surface, $V_s$, is the magnitude of the tangential velocity component since $u_r=0$ on the surface. So, $V_s = |u_\\theta(r=R)| = |-2U\\sin\\theta| = 2U|\\sin\\theta|$.\n\n3.  **Apply the pressure coefficient condition**: We are given that $C_p = 0$. Using the formula for $C_p$:\n    $0 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2$\n    $\\left(\\frac{V_s}{U}\\right)^2 = 1$\n    $\\frac{V_s}{U} = 1$ (since $V_s$ is a speed, it must be positive)\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\theta$**: Substitute the expression for $V_s$ from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{2U|\\sin\\theta|}{U} = 1$\n    $2|\\sin\\theta| = 1$\n    $|\\sin\\theta| = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n5.  **Find $\\theta$ in the first quadrant**: The question asks for the azimuthal location in the first quadrant, which means $0^\\circ \\le \\theta \\le 90^\\circ$. In this quadrant, $\\sin\\theta$ is positive, so we take $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    $\\theta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$\n    $\\theta = 30^\\circ$\n\nTherefore, the azimuthal location is $30$ degrees."

        "Step 1: Identify the given velocity components for radial ($u_r$) and azimuthal ($u_\\theta$) directions in polar coordinates and the free stream speed ($U$). Recognize that for a point on the cylinder surface, the radial coordinate $r$ is equal to the cylinder radius $R$.",
        "Step 2: Substitute $r=R$ into the given velocity component equations. This yields $u_r(R,\\theta) = U(1 - R^2/R^2)\\cos\\theta = 0$ and $u_\\theta(R,\\theta) = -U(1 + R^2/R^2)\\sin\\theta = -2U\\sin\\theta$.",
        "Step 3: Determine the magnitude of the total velocity ($V_s$) on the cylinder surface. Since $u_r=0$ on the surface, $V_s$ is simply the magnitude of the azimuthal velocity component: $V_s = |u_\\theta(R,\\theta)| = |-2U\\sin\\theta| = 2U|\\sin\\theta|$.",
        "Step 4: Recall the formula for the pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for incompressible, inviscid flow: $C_p = 1 - (V_s/U)^2$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the expression for $V_s$ from Step 3 into the $C_p$ formula: $C_p = 1 - (2U|\\sin\\theta|/U)^2 = 1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta$.",
        "Step 6: Set the pressure coefficient $C_p$ to zero, as required by the problem: $1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta = 0$. Solve for $\\sin\\theta$: $4\\sin^2\\theta = 1 \\Rightarrow \\sin^2\\theta = 1/4 \\Rightarrow \\sin\\theta = \\pm 1/2$.",
        "Step 7: Since the question specifies the location is in the first quadrant ($0^\\circ < \\theta < 90^\\circ$), we take the positive root: $\\sin\\theta = 1/2$. Therefore, $\\theta = \\arcsin(1/2) = 30^\\circ$."
