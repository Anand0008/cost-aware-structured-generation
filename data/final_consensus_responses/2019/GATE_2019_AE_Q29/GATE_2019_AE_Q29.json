      "reasoning": "A decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) means that for a given pressure ratio, the actual work required by the compressor ($W_c$) increases. This leads to a higher actual compressor outlet temperature ($T_{02a}$). Since the turbine inlet temperature ($T_{03}$) is constant, the heat added in the combustor ($Q_{in} = c_p (T_{03} - T_{02a})$) decreases, which means the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) decreases. However, the increased compressor work must be supplied by the turbine ($W_t = W_c$). With a fixed $T_{03}$, this means the turbine extracts more energy, resulting in a lower turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$). A lower $T_{04a}$ implies less energy available for expansion in the nozzle, leading to a reduction in exhaust velocity and thus a decrease in thrust ($F$). The engine is performing less efficiently overall. Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) is defined as $\\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$. Although $\\dot{m}_f$ decreases, the thrust $F$ decreases even more significantly due to the increased internal work consumption by the inefficient compressor, leading to a net *increase* in TSFC. Therefore, option C is correct, as the compressor needing more work input from the turbine is the root cause of the reduced net thrust output relative to fuel input."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the effect of decreasing compressor efficiency. A decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency ($\\eta_c$) means that for a given pressure ratio and inlet temperature ($T_{01}$), the actual work input required by the compressor ($W_c$) increases, and consequently, the actual compressor outlet temperature ($T_{02a}$) increases. This is because $\\eta_c = \\frac{T_{02s} - T_{01}}{T_{02a} - T_{01}}$, so if $\\eta_c$ decreases while $T_{02s}$ (isentropic temperature rise for a given pressure ratio) and $T_{01}$ are constant, $T_{02a}$ must increase.",
        "Step 2: Analyze heat input and fuel flow. The heat added in the combustor ($Q_{in}$) is proportional to $(T_{03} - T_{02a})$. Given that the turbine inlet temperature ($T_{03}$) remains constant and $T_{02a}$ increases (from Step 1), the temperature difference $(T_{03} - T_{02a})$ decreases. Therefore, the heat input $Q_{in}$ and the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) decrease.",
        "Step 3: Analyze turbine work and exit temperature. In a turbojet engine, the turbine work ($W_t$) is equal to the compressor work ($W_c$). Since $W_c$ increases (due to lower compressor efficiency, as established in Step 1), $W_t$ also increases. With a constant $T_{03}$, an increase in $W_t = c_p (T_{03} - T_{04a})$ implies that the turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$) must decrease.",
        "Step 4: Analyze thrust generation. A lower turbine exit temperature ($T_{04a}$) means less energy is available for expansion in the nozzle. This leads to a lower exhaust velocity ($V_e$) and consequently a lower thrust ($F$). The increased compressor work (from Step 1) consumes more energy internally, leaving less for jet propulsion.",
        "Step 5: Determine the trend of TSFC. Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) is defined as $\\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$. Although the fuel flow rate ($\\dot{m}_f$) decreases (from Step 2), the thrust ($F$) decreases even more significantly (from Step 4) due to the increased internal work consumption by the compressor. Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F}$ (TSFC) increases, indicating a reduction in overall engine efficiency.",
        "Step 6: In conclusion, with decreasing compressor efficiency and a fixed turbine inlet temperature, the Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) increases because the compressor requires more work from the turbine, leading to a disproportionately larger decrease in thrust compared to the decrease in fuel flow."

        "name": "Overall Efficiency Approach",
        "description": "Instead of tracking $\\dot{m}_f$ and $F$ separately, one can directly reason about the overall thermal efficiency ($\\eta_o$) of the engine. The overall efficiency is defined as $\\eta_o = \\frac{F \\times V_a}{\\dot{m}_f \\times h_{PR}}$ (where $V_a$ is flight speed and $h_{PR}$ is heating value of fuel). Rearranging for TSFC, we get $TSFC = \\frac{\\dot{m}_f}{F} = \\frac{V_a}{\\eta_o \\times h_{PR}}$. If compressor efficiency decreases, the overall engine efficiency ($\\eta_o$) must decrease. This directly implies that TSFC must increase (assuming $V_a$ and $h_{PR}$ are constant).",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More direct and less prone to misinterpreting the relative changes in $\\dot{m}_f$ and $F$. It provides a holistic view of engine performance. Cons: Requires a strong conceptual understanding of overall efficiency and its relation to component efficiencies.",
        "when_to_use": "When the question asks about the overall performance metric like TSFC or overall efficiency, and component inefficiencies are involved. It's often a quicker way to reach the conclusion."

        "pros_cons": "Pros: Links directly to equations and can be extended to numerical problems. Cons: Algebra can be more involved than needed for a 2-mark conceptual question.",
