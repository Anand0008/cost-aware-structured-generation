  "question_text": "The nomenclature of Hindustani music has changed over the centuries. Since the medieval period dhrupad styles were identified as baanis. Terms like gayaki and baaj were used to refer to vocal and instrumental styles, respectively. With the institutionalization of music education the term gharana became acceptable. Gharana originally referred to hereditary musicians from a particular lineage, including disciples and grand disciples.\n\nWhich one of the following pairings is NOT correct?",

      "reasoning": "The passage states that 'gayaki and baaj were used to refer to vocal and instrumental styles, respectively.' This means 'gayaki' refers to vocal styles and 'baaj' refers to instrumental styles. Therefore, the pairing 'baaj, institution' is incorrect, as 'baaj' refers to instrumental styles, not institutions. The other pairings are consistent with the provided text: 'dhrupad styles were identified as baanis', 'gayaki' refers to vocal styles, and 'gharana originally referred to hereditary musicians from a particular lineage'. Since the question asks for the pairing that is NOT correct, option C is the answer."
