      "reasoning": "The question asks about the behavior of Mach number and static temperature for a quasi-one-dimensional isentropic supersonic flow through a diverging duct.\n\n1.  **Mach Number Change:**\n    The area-velocity relation for quasi-one-dimensional isentropic flow is given by: \n    `$$\\frac{dA}{A} = (M^2 - 1) \\frac{dV}{V}$$`\n    For a diverging duct, the area `A` increases in the direction of flow, so `$\\frac{dA}{A} > 0$`. For supersonic flow, the Mach number `M > 1`, which means `$(M^2 - 1) > 0$`. Therefore, `$\\frac{dV}{V} > 0$`, implying that the velocity `V` increases in the direction of flow. Since Mach number `M = V/a`, an increase in velocity `V` leads to an increase in Mach number `M`.\n\n2.  **Static Temperature Change:**\n    For isentropic flow, the stagnation temperature `T_0` remains constant. The relation between stagnation temperature and static temperature is given by the energy equation: \n    `$$T_0 = T + \\frac{V^2}{2c_p}$$`\n    Since `T_0` is constant and we established that `V` (and thus `V^2`) increases in the direction of flow, for the sum to remain constant, the static temperature `T` must decrease. Alternatively, the differential relation for isentropic flow `$$\\frac{dT}{T} = -(\\gamma - 1) M^2 \\frac{dV}{V}$$` also shows that if `$\\frac{dV}{V} > 0$`, then `$\\frac{dT}{T} < 0$`, meaning static temperature `T` decreases.\n\nCombining these two findings, the Mach number increases and the static temperature decreases. This corresponds to option B."

For a diverging duct, A increases, so moving along the duct means increasing A/A* ratio. On the curve, for the supersonic branch (M>1), increasing A/A* corresponds to increasing M. This visually determines the Mach number behavior. Also, from the same plot, T/T0 decreases as M increases.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Visual and intuitive, provides a more intuitive understanding of the relationship, and avoids complex derivatives. Cons: Less precise than the analytical formula, limited to specific gas properties, and requires remembering the shape of the curve.",

      "Thermodynamics": "The concept of isentropic flow, stagnation properties, and the energy equation are directly derived from the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. The decrease in static temperature for an accelerating isentropic flow is an example of an adiabatic expansion where internal energy is converted to kinetic energy, adhering to the First Law.",
      "Fluid Mechanics": "The area-velocity relation is a fundamental principle in compressible fluid mechanics, derived from the conservation of mass (continuity equation) and momentum equation.",
