      "reasoning": "To find the number of intersection points between y = x and y = cos x, we need to find the number of real solutions to the equation x = cos x. This can be reformulated as finding the roots of the function f(x) = x - cos x. We analyze the function's properties:\n1.  **Continuity**: f(x) = x - cos x is continuous for all real x, as both x and cos x are continuous functions.\n2.  **Existence of a root (Intermediate Value Theorem)**:\n    *   For |x| > 1, we know that |cos x| ≤ 1. Therefore, |x| > |cos x|, which means x ≠ cos x. Thus, any intersection must occur in the interval [-1, 1].\n    *   Consider the interval [0, π/2].\n    *   f(0) = 0 - cos(0) = 0 - 1 = -1\n    *   f(π/2) = π/2 - cos(π/2) = π/2 - 0 ≈ 1.57\n    Since f(0) < 0 and f(π/2) > 0, and f(x) is continuous on [0, π/2], the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees at least one real root in the interval (0, π/2).\n3.  **Uniqueness of the root (Monotonicity)**:\n    *   Find the first derivative of f(x): f'(x) = d/dx(x - cos x) = 1 - (-sin x) = 1 + sin x.\n    *   For all real x, the range of sin x is [-1, 1]. Therefore, 1 + sin x is always in the range [0, 2]. This means f'(x) = 1 + sin x ≥ 0 for all real x.\n    *   A function whose derivative is always non-negative is monotonically non-decreasing. Since f'(x) = 0 only at isolated points (where sin x = -1), the function is strictly increasing over any interval where f'(x) > 0. This ensures that the function never decreases and can cross the x-axis at most once.\nCombining the existence and uniqueness arguments, there is exactly one real point of intersection."
