      "reasoning": "To simulate aerodynamic forces, dynamic similarity must be maintained between the prototype and the model. For low-speed, incompressible flow over a bluff body like a cylinder, dynamic similarity is achieved by matching the Reynolds number (Re) for both the prototype and the model. The Reynolds number is defined as Re = (ρVD)/μ, where ρ is fluid density, V is flow velocity, D is characteristic length (cylinder diameter), and μ is dynamic viscosity. Since both experiments are conducted with air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), the fluid properties (ρ and μ) are the same for both the prototype and the model. Therefore, equating the Reynolds numbers simplifies to V_model * D_model = V_prototype * D_prototype. Given D_prototype = 1 m, V_prototype = 1 m/s, and D_model = 0.1 m, the required free stream velocity for the wind tunnel experiment (V_model) can be calculated as V_model = (V_prototype * D_prototype) / D_model = (1 m/s * 1 m) / 0.1 m = 10 m/s."

        "Equate Reynolds numbers for prototype and model: $Re_{\\text{model}} = Re_{\\text{full}}$. Note that the experiment is conducted with air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) for both, so fluid properties ($\\rho$, $\\mu$, $\\nu$) are identical.",
