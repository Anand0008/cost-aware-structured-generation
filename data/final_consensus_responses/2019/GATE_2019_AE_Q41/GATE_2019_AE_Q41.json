      "reasoning": "The induced drag coefficient for a finite wing is given by $C_{D,i} = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}$.\n\nThe lift force is given by $L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C_L$. The problem states that the flight speed ($V$) and ambient density ($\\rho$) are the same for both conditions. The wing area ($S$) is also constant. Therefore, the dynamic pressure ($q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$) is constant. This implies that the lift coefficient is directly proportional to the lift force ($C_L \\propto L$).\n\nFrom the induced drag coefficient formula, since $\\pi e AR$ is constant, we have $C_{D,i} \\propto C_L^2$. Combining this with $C_L \\propto L$, we get $C_{D,i} \\propto L^2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the lift force in the two flight conditions:\n1.  **Steady Level Flight (SLF):** In steady level flight, the lift force ($L_{level}$) balances the aircraft's weight ($W$). So, $L_{level} = W$.\n2.  **Steady Climb:** In a steady climb at a constant flight path angle $\\gamma$, the lift force ($L_{climb}$) balances the component of weight perpendicular to the flight path. Thus, $L_{climb} = W \\cos(\\gamma)$.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the induced drag coefficient during steady level flight to that during a 30-degree climb: $\\frac{C_{D,i,level}}{C_{D,i,climb}}$.\n\nUsing the proportionality $C_{D,i} \\propto L^2$:\n$\\frac{C_{D,i,level}}{C_{D,i,climb}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{level}}{L_{climb}}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $L_{level}$ and $L_{climb}$:\n$\\frac{C_{D,i,level}}{C_{D,i,climb}} = \\left(\\frac{W}{W \\cos(\\gamma)}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\gamma)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\gamma)} = \\sec^2(\\gamma)$\n\nGiven the climb angle $\\gamma = 30^\\circ$:\n$\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660$\n$\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{C_{D,i,level}}{C_{D,i,climb}} = \\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.3333$\n\nRounding off to two decimal places, the ratio is **1.33**."

        "Step 1: Identify given data: weight W = 8000 N, wing area S = 16 m², C_D0 = 0.02, e = 0.8, AR = 6, C_L_level = 0.375 for steady level flight. Climb angle \\theta = 30^\\circ. Note that flight speed and ambient density are constant for both conditions, implying constant dynamic pressure.",
        "Step 2: Recall the formula for induced drag coefficient: $C_{D,i} = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e AR}$. This formula applies to both flight conditions as Oswald's efficiency factor (e) and aspect ratio (AR) are constant.",
        "Step 3: For steady level flight, the lift force balances the weight: $L_{level} = W$. The given $C_{L,level} = 0.375$ corresponds to this condition.",
        "Step 4: For steady climb at an angle \\theta, the force balance perpendicular to the flight path requires the lift force to be $L_{climb} = W \\cos \\theta$. Since speed and density are constant, the dynamic pressure $q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2$ is constant. As $C_L = L / (qS)$, this implies $C_L \\propto L$. Therefore, $C_{L,climb} = C_{L,level} \\cos \\theta$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the lift coefficient during climb: $C_{L,climb} = C_{L,level} \\cos 30^\\circ = 0.375 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.375 \\times 0.8660 \\approx 0.32475$.",
        "Step 6: Form the ratio of induced drag coefficients during the climb to that in level flight: $\\frac{C_{D,i,climb}}{C_{D,i,level}} = \\frac{C_{L,climb}^2 / (\\pi e AR)}{C_{L,level}^2 / (\\pi e AR)} = \\left(\\frac{C_{L,climb}}{C_{L,level}}\\right)^2$. Substitute the relationship from Step 4: $\\left(\\frac{C_{L,level} \\cos \\theta}{C_{L,level}}\\right)^2 = \\cos^2 \\theta$.",
        "Step 7: Evaluate the ratio: $\\cos^2 30^\\circ = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$. Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.75."

The ratio simplifies to $\\sec^2 \\gamma$. Avoid overcomplicating with full numeric substitution.",

This means $C_L$ in climb is lower than in level flight for the same speed, so induced drag coefficient in level flight should be higher. Therefore, the ratio of induced drag coefficient in level flight to climb must be greater than 1. For a 30° climb, $\\cos 30^\\circ < 1$, so the ratio will be greater than 1, likely around 1.33.",
