      "reasoning": "The specific work input for an axial compressor stage is determined by Euler's turbomachine equation, which relates the work done to the change in angular momentum of the fluid. The formula is given by W = U(c_t2 - c_t1), where U is the blade speed, c_t1 is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet, and c_t2 is the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet.\n\nFrom the provided velocity triangle diagram:\n1.  The blade speed, U = 100 m/s.\n2.  The axial velocity, c_z = 60 m/s. (Assuming constant axial velocity, which is standard for axial compressors and implied by the common height of the triangles).\n3.  The inlet absolute flow angle, α_1 = 30°.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor inlet (c_t1):\nFrom the inlet velocity triangle (left triangle), c_t1 is the side opposite to α_1 in a right-angled triangle where c_z is the adjacent side.\nc_t1 = c_z tan(α_1) = 60 m/s × tan(30°)\nc_t1 = 60 m/s × (1/√3) ≈ 60 × 0.57735 = 34.641 m/s.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the tangential component of the absolute velocity at the rotor outlet (c_t2):\nThe diagram shows the total blade speed U = 100 m/s as the base of the combined velocity triangles. The horizontal distance from the right end of the U line to the vertical line representing c_z at the outlet is labeled as 40 m/s. This represents the tangential component of the relative velocity at the outlet, w_t2.\nFor a compressor rotor, the outlet absolute tangential velocity c_t2 is typically greater than c_t1. From the vector relationship U = c_t2 + w_t2 (where w_t2 is measured from the tip of c_t2 to the tip of U) or more directly from the diagram's geometry where w_t2 is measured from the right end of U towards the left, we have:\nc_t2 = U - w_t2 = 100 m/s - 40 m/s = 60 m/s.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the specific work input (W):\nUsing Euler's turbomachine equation:\nW = U(c_t2 - c_t1)\nW = 100 m/s × (60 m/s - 34.641 m/s)\nW = 100 m/s × 25.359 m/s\nW = 2535.9 J/kg.\n\nStep 4: Convert to kJ/kg and round off:\nW = 2.5359 kJ/kg.\nRounding off to 2 decimal places, W = 2.54 kJ/kg. This value falls within the specified range of 2.50 to 2.60."
