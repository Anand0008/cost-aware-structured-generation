      "reasoning": "The function `f(x)` is defined as `f(x) = (1/2)(x + |x|)`. To evaluate the integral `Integral[-1, 1] f(x) dx`, we first need to define `f(x)` as a piecewise function based on the definition of the absolute value `|x|`.\n\n1.  **Define `f(x)` piecewise:**\n    *   If `x >= 0`, then `|x| = x`. Substituting this into `f(x)`:\n        `f(x) = (1/2)(x + x) = (1/2)(2x) = x`\n    *   If `x < 0`, then `|x| = -x`. Substituting this into `f(x)`:\n        `f(x) = (1/2)(x + (-x)) = (1/2)(x - x) = (1/2)(0) = 0`\n    So, the function `f(x)` can be written as:\n    `f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\ 0 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}`\n\n2.  **Split the integral:**\n    The integral is from -1 to 1. Since the definition of `f(x)` changes at `x = 0`, we must split the integral at this point:\n    `Integral[-1, 1] f(x) dx = Integral[-1, 0] f(x) dx + Integral[0, 1] f(x) dx`\n\n3.  **Evaluate each sub-integral:**\n    *   For the interval `[-1, 0]`, `x < 0`, so `f(x) = 0`:\n        `Integral[-1, 0] 0 dx = 0`\n    *   For the interval `[0, 1]`, `x >= 0`, so `f(x) = x`:\n        `Integral[0, 1] x dx = \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^1 = \\left(\\frac{1^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}`\n\n4.  **Sum the results:**\n    `Integral[-1, 1] f(x) dx = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5`\n\n5.  **Round off to 1 decimal place:**\n    The calculated value is 0.5, which is already rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is 0.5."

For x in [0, 1], f(x)=x, which is a line segment with slope 1. The integral represents the signed area under the curve. The area from x=-1 to x=0 is 0 (a rectangle of height 0). The area from x=0 to x=1 is a right triangle with base 1 and height 1. The area of this triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 0.5. The total area, and thus the integral, is 0 + 0.5 = 0.5.",
