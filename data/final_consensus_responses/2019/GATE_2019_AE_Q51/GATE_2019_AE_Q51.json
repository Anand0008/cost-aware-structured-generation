      "reasoning": "The problem requires calculating the new factor of safety for a hollow shaft, given the factor of safety for a solid shaft, both transmitting the same torque $T$ and made of the same material (implying constant allowable shear stress $\\tau_{allow}$). The factor of safety (FoS) is defined as the ratio of allowable shear stress to the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) developed in the shaft, i.e., $FoS = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max}}$. The maximum shear stress is given by the torsion formula $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T R}{J}$, where $R$ is the outer radius and $J$ is the polar moment of inertia.\nFor the solid shaft, $J_{solid} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$. Given $FoS_{solid} = 2$, we have $2 = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max,solid}} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{T R / J_{solid}}$.\nFor the hollow shaft, with outer radius $R$ and inner radius $R_i = R/2$, $J_{hollow} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R^4 - (R/2)^4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}R^4(1 - 1/16) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}R^4(\\frac{15}{16}) = \\frac{15}{16} J_{solid}$.\nThe maximum shear stress in the hollow shaft is $\\tau_{max,hollow} = \\frac{T R}{J_{hollow}}$.\nSince $\\tau_{allow}$ is constant, the new factor of safety $FoS_{hollow} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max,hollow}} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{T R / J_{hollow}} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow} J_{hollow}}{T R}$.\nWe can find the ratio: $\\frac{FoS_{hollow}}{FoS_{solid}} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow} J_{hollow} / (T R)}{\\tau_{allow} J_{solid} / (T R)} = \\frac{J_{hollow}}{J_{solid}}$.\nSo, $FoS_{hollow} = FoS_{solid} \\times \\frac{J_{hollow}}{J_{solid}} = 2 \\times \\frac{15}{16} = \\frac{30}{16} = 1.875$.\nRounding to one decimal place, the factor of safety for the hollow shaft is 1.9."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters for both shafts: For the solid shaft, applied torque $T$, outer radius $R$, and factor of safety $FoS_{solid} = 2$. For the hollow shaft, same material (implying constant allowable shear stress $\\tau_{allow}$), identical outer radius $R$, and inner radius $R_i = R/2$. Recall the fundamental torsion formula for maximum shear stress $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T R}{J}$ and the definition of factor of safety $FoS = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max}}$.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the polar moment of inertia for the solid shaft: $J_{solid} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$. For the hollow shaft, $J_{hollow} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R_{outer}^4 - R_{inner}^4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R^4 - (R/2)^4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}R^4(1 - 1/16) = \\frac{15}{16} \\left(\\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}\\right) = \\frac{15}{16} J_{solid}$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the polar moment of inertia for the solid shaft ($J_{solid}$): $J_{solid} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the maximum shear stress in the solid shaft ($\\tau_{max,solid}$) under torque $T$: $\\tau_{max,solid} = \\frac{T R}{J_{solid}} = \\frac{T R}{(\\pi R^4/2)} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3}$.",
        "Step 5: Use the given factor of safety for the solid shaft ($FoS_{solid} = 2$) to determine the allowable shear stress ($\\tau_{allow}$): $FoS_{solid} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max,solid}} \\implies \\tau_{allow} = 2 \\cdot \\tau_{max,solid} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3} = \\frac{4T}{\\pi R^3}$. This $\\tau_{allow}$ is a material property and remains constant for the hollow shaft.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the polar moment of inertia for the hollow shaft ($J_{hollow}$) with outer radius $R_o = R$ and inner radius $R_i = R/2$: $J_{hollow} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R_o^4 - R_i^4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R^4 - (R/2)^4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(R^4 - \\frac{R^4}{16}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(\\frac{15R^4}{16}) = \\frac{15 \\pi R^4}{32}$.",
        "Step 7: Determine the maximum shear stress in the hollow shaft ($\\tau_{max,hollow}$) under the same torque $T$. This occurs at the outer radius $R_o = R$: $\\tau_{max,hollow} = \\frac{T \\cdot R_o}{J_{hollow}} = \\frac{T \\cdot R}{\\frac{15 \\pi R^4}{32}} = \\frac{32T}{15 \\pi R^3}$.",
        "Step 8: Calculate the factor of safety for the hollow shaft ($FoS_{hollow}$) using the allowable shear stress ($\\tau_{allow}$) and the maximum shear stress in the hollow shaft ($\\tau_{max,hollow}$): $FoS_{hollow} = \\frac{\\tau_{allow}}{\\tau_{max,hollow}} = \\frac{\\frac{4T}{\\pi R^3}}{\\frac{32T}{15 \\pi R^3}} = \\frac{4T}{\\pi R^3} \\cdot \\frac{15 \\pi R^3}{32T} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 15}{32} = \\frac{60}{32} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$.",

They are also found in control surfaces and landing gear mechanisms. This design minimizes weight, improving fuel efficiency and performance, while still providing a superior strength-to-weight ratio. Engineers must carefully recalculate the factor of safety to ensure structural integrity.",

Hollow shafts provide a superior strength-to-weight ratio, allowing engineers to achieve required torsional strength and stiffness with less material. Additionally, accurately determining the factor of safety is crucial; underestimation can lead to catastrophic torsional failure, while overestimation results in unnecessary weight and reduced performance."
