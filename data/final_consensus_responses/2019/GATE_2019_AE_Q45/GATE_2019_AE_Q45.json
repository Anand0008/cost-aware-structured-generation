      "reasoning": "For an optimally expanded rocket nozzle, the exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$). This condition causes the pressure thrust term in the general thrust equation to become zero. The general thrust equation for a rocket engine is: $F = \\dot{m} V_e + (P_e - P_a) A_e$. Since $P_e = P_a$, the term $(P_e - P_a) A_e$ becomes $0$. Thus, the thrust equation simplifies to $F = \\dot{m} V_e$. The question asks for the ratio $F / (\\dot{m} V_e)$. Substituting the simplified thrust equation, we get $F / (\\dot{m} V_e) = (\\dot{m} V_e) / (\\dot{m} V_e) = 1$. The given velocity ratio $r = V_a / V_e = 2$ is extraneous information and not required for this calculation."
