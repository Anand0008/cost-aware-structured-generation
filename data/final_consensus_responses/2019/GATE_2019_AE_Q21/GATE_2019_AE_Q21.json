We are given the mass ($m = 1$ kg), initial temperature ($T_1 = 100$ K), final temperature ($T_2 = 600$ K), and energy added at constant pressure ($Q_p = 500$ kJ). The gas is diatomic, and the process is at constant pressure. For a constant pressure process, the energy added equals the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).",
        "Step 2: Calculate the temperature change ($\\Delta T$). $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 600\\text{ K} - 100\\text{ K} = 500\\text{ K}$. The energy added at constant pressure ($Q_p$) is equal to the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$), which can be expressed as $\\Delta H = m c_p \\Delta T$.",
        "Step 3: Substitute the given values into the enthalpy change formula: $Q_p = \\Delta H = 500 \\, \\text{kJ}$, $m = 1 \\, \\text{kg}$, and $\\Delta T = 500 \\, \\text{K}$. Solve for the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$): $c_p = \\frac{Q_p}{m \\Delta T} = \\frac{500\\text{ kJ}}{1\\text{ kg} \\times 500\\text{ K}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{kJ/kgK}$.",
        "Step 4: For a diatomic gas, the ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) is typically 1.4, assuming a calorically perfect gas model at moderate temperatures (100 K to 600 K). This ratio is defined as $\\gamma = c_p / c_v$.",
        "Step 5: Use the relation $\\gamma = c_p / c_v$ to calculate the specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$): $c_v = \\frac{c_p}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1.0\\text{ kJ/kgK}}{1.4} = 0.7142857 \\, \\text{kJ/kgK}$.",
