This occurs because when the load passes through the shear center, the net moment (torque) about the beam's longitudinal axis due to the internal shear stress distribution is zero. Therefore, the twist per unit length of the beam will be zero. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: shear stress is generally not uniform across the section; bending stresses are present due to the bending moment caused by the shear force; and shear strain is generally not zero at the shear center, as it is related to the applied shear stress, but the twisting deformation is zero."

        "When a transverse shear force is applied through the shear center, the beam undergoes pure bending without any torsional deformation (twisting). This occurs because the internal shear flows generate a net torque about the shear center equal to zero, thus preventing any tendency for the beam to twist.",
        "The absence of twisting implies that the angle of twist along the beam's longitudinal axis does not change, meaning the rate of change of twist with respect to length, or the twist per unit length, must be zero.",
        "Based on this understanding, the correct option is that the twist per unit length of the beam will be zero.",
        "Dismiss other options: Option B (uniform shear stress) is incorrect as shear stress distribution is generally non-uniform across a beam's cross-section. Option C (zero bending stresses) is incorrect because a transverse shear load inherently produces a bending moment, leading to bending stresses. Option D (zero shear strain at shear center) is incorrect as shear strain is present where shear stress exists due to the applied shear load."
