        "name": "General Formula for Indeterminacy of Frames",
        "description": "For more complex 2D frames, the degree of static indeterminacy can be calculated using a more general formula: $DSI = (3m + r) - (3j + c)$, where $m$ is the number of members, $r$ is the number of external reactions, $j$ is the number of joints, and $c$ is the number of condition equations (e.g., for internal hinges). For a simple beam, this simplifies to $DSI = r - 3$ (external indeterminacy).",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: Applicable to a wider range of structures (trusses, frames). Cons: More complex for simple beams, requires identifying members and joints.",
        "when_to_use": "When analyzing complex frame structures or trusses, not just simple beams."
