To determine the most consistent player, we calculate the variance (or standard deviation) of scores for each player. The player with the lowest variance (or standard deviation) is the most consistent, as their scores are less spread out.\n\n**1. Calculate Average Score (Accuracy) for each player:**\n*   **Player P Scores:** {1, 5, 1, 10, 1, 10, 5}\n    Sum = $1+5+1+10+1+10+5 = 33$\n    Average ($\\mu_P$) = $33/7 \\approx 4.71$\n*   **Player Q Scores:** {5, 10, 1, 10, 5, 10, 10}\n    Sum = $5+10+1+10+5+10+10 = 51$\n    Average ($\\mu_Q$) = $51/7 \\approx 7.29$\n*   **Player R Scores:** {1, 10, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1}\n    Sum = $1+10+1+1+5+1+1 = 20$\n    Average ($\\mu_R$) = $20/7 \\approx 2.86$\n*   **Player S Scores:** {10, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 1}\n    Sum = $10+1+1+1+10+1+1 = 25$\n    Average ($\\mu_S$) = $25/7 \\approx 3.57$\n\n**Conclusion for Accuracy:** Player Q has the highest average score ($\\approx 7.29$), making Q the most accurate player.\n\n**2. Calculate Variance (Consistency) for each player:**\nVariance ($\\sigma^2$) is calculated as $\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}$, where $x_i$ are individual scores, $\\mu$ is the mean score, and $N=7$ is the number of rounds.\n*   **Player P Variance ($\\sigma_P^2$):**\n    Scores: {1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 10}. Mean $\\approx 4.71$\n    $\\sigma_P^2 = \\frac{3(1-4.71)^2 + 2(5-4.71)^2 + 2(10-4.71)^2}{7} \\approx \\frac{3(13.76) + 2(0.08) + 2(28.00)}{7} = \\frac{41.28 + 0.16 + 56}{7} = \\frac{97.44}{7} \\approx 13.92$\n*   **Player Q Variance ($\\sigma_Q^2$):**\n    Scores: {1, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10}. Mean $\\approx 7.29$\n    $\\sigma_Q^2 = \\frac{1(1-7.29)^2 + 2(5-7.29)^2 + 4(10-7.29)^2}{7} \\approx \\frac{1(39.56) + 2(5.24) + 4(7.34)}{7} = \\frac{39.56 + 10.48 + 29.36}{7} = \\frac{79.4}{7} \\approx 11.34$\n*   **Player R Variance ($\\sigma_R^2$):**\n    Scores: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 10}. Mean $\\approx 2.86$\n    $\\sigma_R^2 = \\frac{5(1-2.86)^2 + 1(5-2.86)^2 + 1(10-2.86)^2}{7} \\approx \\frac{5(3.46) + 1(4.58) + 1(51.00)}{7} = \\frac{17.3 + 4.58 + 51.00}{7} = \\frac{72.88}{7} \\approx 10.41$\n*   **Player S Variance ($\\sigma_S^2$):**\n    Scores: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 10}. Mean $\\approx 3.57$\n    $\\sigma_S^2 = \\frac{5(1-3.57)^2 + 2(10-3.57)^2}{7} \\approx \\frac{5(6.60) + 2(41.34)}{7} = \\frac{33.0 + 82.68}{7} = \\frac{115.68}{7} \\approx 16.53$\n\n**Conclusion for Consistency:** Player R has the lowest variance ($\\approx 10.41$), making R the most consistent player.\n\nCombining these, the most accurate player is Q and the most consistent player is R. This corresponds to option B."
