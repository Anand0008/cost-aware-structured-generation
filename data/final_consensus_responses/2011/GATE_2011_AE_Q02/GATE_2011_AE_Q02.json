      "reasoning": "A function $f(x)$ is defined as periodic if there exists a positive constant $T$ (called the period) such that $f(x+T) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\\n\\nLet's analyze each option:\\nA. $f(x) = x^2$: If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $(x+T)^2 = x^2$, which expands to $x^2 + 2xT + T^2 = x^2$. This simplifies to $2xT + T^2 = 0$. For this equation to hold for all $x$, we must have $2T=0$ and $T^2=0$, which implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = x^2$ is not periodic.\\nB. $f(x) = \\log x$: If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $\\log(x+T) = \\log x$. For this equality to hold, $x+T = x$, which implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = \\log x$ is not periodic.\\nC. $f(x) = e^x$: If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. This means $e^{x+T} = e^x$, which can be written as $e^x e^T = e^x$. Dividing by $e^x$ (which is never zero), we get $e^T = 1$. This implies $T=0$. Since a period must be a positive constant, $f(x) = e^x$ is not periodic.\\nD. $f(x) = \\text{const.}$: Let $f(x) = C$, where $C$ is any real constant. If $f(x)$ were periodic with period $T>0$, then $f(x+T) = f(x)$. For a constant function, $f(x+T) = C$ and $f(x) = C$. Thus, $C = C$, which is true for any positive constant $T$. Therefore, a constant function is periodic (with any positive real number as its period)."

        "Recall the definition of a periodic function: A function $f(x)$ is periodic if there exists a positive constant $T$ (the period) such that $f(x+T) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. The period $T$ must be strictly greater than zero.",
        "Analyze each given option by applying the definition of a periodic function, checking if a positive period $T$ exists such that $f(x+T) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the function's domain.",
        "For Option A, $f(x) = x^2$: Assume $f(x+T) = f(x)$, so $(x+T)^2 = x^2$. Expanding gives $x^2 + 2xT + T^2 = x^2$, which simplifies to $2xT + T^2 = 0$. For this to hold for all $x$, we must have $2T=0$ and $T^2=0$, implying $T=0$. Since a periodic function requires $T>0$, $f(x) = x^2$ is not periodic.",
        "For Option B, $f(x) = \\log x$: If $f(x+T) = f(x)$, then $\\log(x+T) = \\log x$. Due to the one-to-one property of the logarithm function, this implies $x+T = x$, leading to $T=0$. Alternatively, since $f(x) = \\log x$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$, $f(x+T) > f(x)$ for any $T>0$. Thus, $f(x) = \\log x$ is not periodic.",
        "For Option C, $f(x) = e^x$: If $f(x+T) = f(x)$, then $e^{x+T} = e^x$. This implies $e^x e^T = e^x$. Dividing by $e^x$ (which is never zero) gives $e^T = 1$, so $T=0$. Alternatively, since $f(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, $f(x+T) > f(x)$ for any $T>0$. Thus, $f(x) = e^x$ is not periodic.",
        "For Option D, $f(x) = \\text{const.}$: Let $f(x) = C$. Then $f(x+T) = C$ and $f(x) = C$. So, $f(x+T) = f(x)$ holds true for any positive value of $T$. Therefore, a constant function is periodic, as it repeats its value at all intervals, and any $T>0$ can be considered a period."
