        "Read the passage carefully to identify the four cloud types mentioned (Nimbus, Stratus, Cirrus, Cumulus) and their descriptions. Understand that the question asks for an inference based *only* on the provided text.",
        "Evaluate Option A: \"A cumulus cloud on the ground is called fog\". The passage does not mention fog or clouds on the ground, so this cannot be inferred.",
        "Evaluate Option B: \"It is easy to predict the weather by studying clouds\". The passage describes cloud characteristics but provides no information about weather prediction, so this cannot be inferred.",
        "Evaluate Option C: \"Clouds are generally of very different shapes, sizes and mass\". The passage describes distinct visual characteristics for each cloud type (e.g., \"dark and ragged\", \"dull in colour\", \"thin and delicate\", \"look like cotton balls\"), which directly implies differences in shape and size. While 'mass' is not explicitly stated, differences in shape and size would generally correlate with differences in mass. This is a plausible inference.",
        "Evaluate Option D: \"There are four basic cloud types: stratus, nimbus, cumulus and cirrus\". The passage explicitly names and describes these four distinct types of clouds. This is a direct enumeration and characterization from the text, making it a very strong inference.",
        "Compare the strength of inferences for Options C and D. Both appear plausible. However, Option D is a more direct and explicit summary of the information presented in the passage (the passage *is* a list of these four types). Option C requires a slight interpretive step regarding 'mass' and a generalization from specific descriptions.",
        "In inference questions, the most direct and least ambiguous conclusion based solely on the text is preferred.",
        "Conclude that Option D is the strongest and most accurate inference from the passage."
