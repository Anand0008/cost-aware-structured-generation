      "reasoning": "The problem asks to choose a material such that the weight of the shaft is minimum, given that it must transmit a specific torque. For a thin-walled hollow shaft, the maximum shear stress ($\\tau_{max}$) is related to the applied torque (T), mean radius (R), and wall thickness (t) by the approximation: $\\tau_{max} \\approx \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 t}$. To prevent yielding, $\\tau_{max}$ must be less than or equal to the shear yield stress ($\\tau_y$) of the material. Thus, the minimum required thickness ($t_{min}$) is $t_{min} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y}$. The weight (W) of the shaft is given by $W = A_{CS} L \\rho$, where $A_{CS}$ is the cross-sectional area, L is the length, and $\\rho$ is the density. For a thin-walled hollow shaft, $A_{CS} \\approx 2 \\pi R t$. Substituting $t_{min}$ into the weight formula: $W = (2 \\pi R \\left( \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y} \\right)) L \\rho = \\frac{T L \\rho}{R \\tau_y}$. Since T, L, and R are constant for all materials, to minimize the weight W, we need to minimize the ratio $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$.\n\nCalculating $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ for each material:\n1.  **Material X:** $\\frac{\\rho_X}{\\tau_{yX}} = \\frac{7700 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{550 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 14 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n2.  **Material Y:** $\\frac{\\rho_Y}{\\tau_{yY}} = \\frac{2700 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{225 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 12 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n3.  **Material Z:** $\\frac{\\rho_Z}{\\tau_{yZ}} = \\frac{4875 \\text{ kg/m}^3}{375 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ kg/(m}^2 \\text{Pa)}$\n\nComparing these values, Material Y has the minimum $\\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}$ ratio ($12 \\times 10^{-6}$). Therefore, Material Y should be chosen for minimum weight."

        "Since the torque (T), length (L), and mean radius (R) are constant, the weight W is directly proportional to the ratio \\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y}. To minimize W, choose the material with the minimum \\frac{\\rho}{\\tau_y} ratio.",

        "description": "Instead of deriving the general optimization parameter ($\\rho / \\tau_y$), one could calculate the minimum required thickness ($t_{min}$) for each material using $t_{min} = \\frac{T}{2 \\pi R^2 \\tau_y}$. Then, calculate the actual weight $W = (2 \\pi R t_{min}) L \\rho$ for each material and compare the resulting weights directly.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More intuitive for some students as it involves direct calculation. Cons: More prone to calculation errors due to multiple steps and numerical values, less efficient, and doesn't reveal the underlying material efficiency parameter as clearly.",
        "when_to_use": "This method can be used if the derivation of the optimization parameter is unclear, or if the problem involves multiple, complex constraints that make a single optimization parameter difficult to isolate. However, for this specific problem, it is less efficient."
