      "reasoning": "The aerodynamic center (AC) is defined as the point on an airfoil where the pitching moment coefficient remains constant with changes in angle of attack. For subsonic flow, it is typically located at 25% of the chord (0.25c) from the leading edge. However, for a supersonic airfoil, the aerodynamic center shifts aft due to the formation of shock waves and changes in pressure distribution. According to fundamental aerodynamics principles and linearized supersonic flow theory, the aerodynamic center for a thin airfoil in purely supersonic flow is located at approximately 50% of the chord (0.5c) from the leading edge. This is a well-established rule in high-speed aerodynamics, as indicated by the retrieved knowledge. Therefore, option C (0.5c) is the correct answer."
