        "Translate the given conditions into mathematical relationships. The number of children 'X' between two individuals at positions $pos(A)$ and $pos(B)$ implies $|pos(A) - pos(B)| = X + 1$.\n*   5 children between L and M $\\implies |pos(L) - pos(M)| = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   8 children between M and N $\\implies |pos(M) - pos(N)| = 8 + 1 = 9$.\n*   3 children ahead of N $\\implies pos(N) = 3 + 1 = 4$ (N is the 4th person in the queue).\n*   21 children behind L $\\implies$ Total children = $pos(L) + 21$.",

This gives two possibilities: $pos(M) - 4 = 9 \\implies pos(M) = 13$ or $pos(M) - 4 = -9 \\implies pos(M) = -5$. Since position cannot be negative, $pos(M) = 13$.",
