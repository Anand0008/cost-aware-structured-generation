      "reasoning": "The sentence requires an infinitive phrase ('To survive') to act as the subject. The structure 'To + verb' (infinitive) is used to express purpose or to function as a noun (subject or object). In this sentence, 'To survive' functions as the subject, meaning 'The act of surviving in the frozen wastes of Arctic requires special equipment.' While 'Surviving' (a gerund) can also function as a subject, 'To survive' is often more idiomatic and grammatically preferred in this context, emphasizing the necessity or challenge of the action. Using 'Survival' (a noun) is grammatically correct but changes the nuance from the active 'to survive' to the state of 'survival'. 'To survive' is generally preferred when describing the action required. 'That survival' is grammatically incorrect and creates an awkward sentence. Therefore, 'A. To survive' best completes the sentence."

        "Determine the grammatical forms that can function as the subject. The blank requires a noun phrase or a verb form acting as a noun (gerund or infinitive).",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'To survive'. This is an infinitive phrase (to + verb). Infinitives can function as nouns, acting as the subject. \"To survive in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment\" is grammatically correct and idiomatic, implying the purpose or necessity.",
        "Evaluate Option B: 'Surviving'. This is a gerund (verb-ing). Gerunds also function as nouns and can be subjects. While grammatically plausible, the infinitive 'To survive' often implies purpose or a general truth/necessity more strongly, making it a better fit for the context of 'takes special equipment'.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'Survival'. This is a noun. While 'Survival in the frozen wastes of Arctic takes special equipment' is grammatically correct, 'To survive' emphasizes the action or effort required, which aligns well with the verb 'takes' (requires). It sounds less natural than the infinitive in this specific construction.",
        "Evaluate Option D: 'That survival'. This phrase is grammatically incorrect and awkward in this context. 'That' would typically introduce a clause or specify a particular instance, neither of which works here.",
        "Conclude the best option. Comparing the options, 'To survive' is the most appropriate and idiomatic choice for this sentence, as it clearly expresses the general act or challenge that requires special equipment.",
