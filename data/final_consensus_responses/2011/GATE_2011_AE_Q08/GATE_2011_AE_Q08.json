      "reasoning": "A statically indeterminate frame structure is defined as one where the number of unknown forces (external reactions and internal member forces) exceeds the number of independent equations of static equilibrium available. In the context of the given options, 'joint degrees of freedom' ($D_k$) represent the number of independent displacements (translations and rotations) that can occur at the joints. For a 2D plane frame, there are 3 independent global equilibrium equations ($\\sum F_x = 0$, $\\sum F_y = 0$, and $\\sum M_z = 0$). For a statically indeterminate frame, the number of unknown displacements (joint degrees of freedom) and/or forces is greater than the number of available equilibrium equations. This necessitates additional equations derived from deformation and compatibility conditions to solve the structure. Therefore, option B, \"number of joint degrees of freedom greater than the number of equilibrium equations,\" correctly describes a characteristic of a statically indeterminate frame structure. Options A and C are not universally true for all statically indeterminate frames, and option D is incorrect as indeterminate structures can be solved using mechanics with additional compatibility equations."

        "Understand 'joint degrees of freedom' (D_k): These are the independent displacements (translations and rotations) that can occur at the joints of the frame.",
        "For a statically indeterminate frame, the number of unknown forces (or displacements) exceeds the available equilibrium equations. This implies that additional equations, derived from deformation (compatibility equations), are required for analysis.",
        "In a typical statically indeterminate frame, the number of joint degrees of freedom (D_k) is generally much larger than the number of global equilibrium equations (3 for a 2D frame).",
        "Therefore, a key characteristic of a statically indeterminate frame is that its number of joint degrees of freedom is greater than the number of equilibrium equations."
