      "reasoning": "The problem is solved by applying Vieta's formulas, which relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. For a quadratic equation of the form $x^2 + Px + Q = 0$, if the roots are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, then the sum of the roots is $\\alpha + \\beta = -P$ and the product of the roots is $\\alpha \\beta = Q$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first attempt:** The student incorrectly wrote the constant term. This implies that the coefficient of $x$ was correctly written. The roots obtained were (4, 3). The sum of these roots is $4 + 3 = 7$. Therefore, the correct sum of roots for the actual equation is 7. From Vieta's formulas, $-P = 7$, so the correct coefficient of $x$ is $P = -7$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second attempt:** The student incorrectly wrote the coefficient of $x$. This implies that the constant term was correctly written. The roots obtained were (3, 2). The product of these roots is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. Therefore, the correct product of roots for the actual equation is 6. From Vieta's formulas, $Q = 6$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the correct quadratic equation:** Using the correct coefficient of $x$ ($P = -7$) and the correct constant term ($Q = 6$), the correct quadratic equation (assuming a leading coefficient of 1) is $x^2 + (-7)x + 6 = 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Find the roots of the correct equation:** To find the roots of $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$, we can factorize it: $(x-1)(x-6) = 0$. The roots are $x=1$ and $x=6$. This matches option C."

        "In the first attempt, the constant term (c) is written incorrectly as $c'$, but the coefficient of x (b) is correct. The roots obtained are 4 and 3. For a quadratic $x^2 + bx + c' = 0$, sum of roots = -b = 4+3 = 7, so b = -7. Product of roots = c' = 4*3 = 12. So, first attempt gives b = -7 and c' = 12.",
        "In the second attempt, the coefficient of x (b) is written incorrectly as $b''$, but the constant term (c) is correct. The roots obtained are 3 and 2. For a quadratic $x^2 + b''x + c = 0$, sum of roots = -b'' = 3+2 = 5, so b'' = -5. Product of roots = c = 3*2 = 6. So, second attempt gives b'' = -5 and c = 6.",
        "From Step 2, the correct coefficient b = -7. From Step 3, the correct constant c = 6. Therefore, the correct quadratic equation is $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$.",
