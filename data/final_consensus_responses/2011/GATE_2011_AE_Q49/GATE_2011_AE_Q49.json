      "reasoning": "A cantilever beam is characterized by being fixed at one end (say, $x=0$) and free at the other end (say, $x=L$). The boundary conditions for each end are: \n\n**At the fixed end ($x=0$):**\n1.  Displacement is zero: $w(0,t) = 0$. (Option A is a valid BC)\n2.  Slope is zero: $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0$.\n    At a fixed end, there is a reaction bending moment and a reaction shear force. Therefore, the bending moment and shear force are generally non-zero.\n    Bending moment is proportional to the second derivative of displacement: $M = EI \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(0,t) \\neq 0$.\n    Shear force is proportional to the third derivative of displacement: $V = EI \\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}(0,t) \\neq 0$.\n\n**At the free end ($x=L$):**\n1.  Bending moment is zero: $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(L,t) = 0$. (Option B is a valid BC)\n2.  Shear force is zero: $\\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}(L,t) = 0$. (Option D is a valid BC)\n\nComparing these with the given options, Option C, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(0,t) = 0$, implies that the bending moment at the fixed end is zero. This is incorrect for a fixed support, as a fixed support resists rotation by exerting a bending moment. Therefore, option C CANNOT be a possible boundary condition for a cantilever beam."

        "Step 1: Identify the type of beam shown in the figure. The figure clearly depicts a cantilever beam, which is fixed at $x=0$ and free at $x=L$.",
        "For a cantilever beam fixed at x=0, the displacement w(0,t) must be zero, and the slope \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}(0,t) must be zero. A fixed support can transmit bending moment and shear force, so these are generally non-zero.",
        "For the free end at x=L, there are no external bending moment or shear force. Thus, the bending moment M(L,t) must be zero, and the shear force V(L,t) must be zero.",
        "According to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the bending moment M is proportional to the second derivative of displacement (M = -EI \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}), and the shear force V is proportional to the third derivative (V = -EI \\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}). Therefore, the free end conditions are \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(L,t) = 0 and \\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}(L,t) = 0.",
        "Now, evaluate each given option against these established boundary conditions for a cantilever beam.",
        "Option A: w(0,t) = 0. This is a valid boundary condition for the fixed end, representing zero displacement.",
        "Option B: \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(L,t) = 0. This is a valid boundary condition for the free end, representing zero bending moment.",
        "Option C: \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}(0,t) = 0. This implies zero bending moment at the fixed end. This is incorrect, as a fixed end must resist rotation and therefore typically experiences a non-zero reaction bending moment.",
        "Option D: \\frac{\\partial^3 w}{\\partial x^3}(L,t) = 0. This is a valid boundary condition for the free end, representing zero shear force.",
