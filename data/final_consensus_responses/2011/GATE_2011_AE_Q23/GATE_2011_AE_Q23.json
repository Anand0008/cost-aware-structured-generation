      "reasoning": "The correct answer is C, 'pressure gradient induced separation in that stage'. The pressure ratio achievable in any single stage of a jet engine compressor is fundamentally limited by aerodynamic phenomena, primarily flow separation. As air flows through the diffusing passages between compressor blades, its velocity decreases, and its static pressure increases. This creates an 'adverse pressure gradient' in the direction of flow. If this pressure gradient becomes too steep, the boundary layer on the blade surface can separate. This flow separation leads to significant losses, reduced efficiency, and can cause compressor stall, where the pressure rise collapses. Therefore, the maximum pressure ratio per stage is limited by the ability to maintain attached flow and avoid pressure gradient induced separation.\n\nRegarding other options:\n*   Option A (entry stagnation temperature) affects the density and mass flow, but it's not the direct aerodynamic limit on pressure ratio per stage.\n*   Option B (entry Mach number) is a significant factor. High relative Mach numbers can lead to shock waves and stronger adverse pressure gradients, which can cause shock-induced boundary layer separation. While a high Mach number is a cause, the direct phenomenon limiting the pressure rise is the separation itself.\n*   Option D (mass flow rate) is an operating parameter and a consequence of the design and operating point, not a fundamental limit on the achievable pressure ratio per stage."

        "If this adverse pressure gradient becomes too strong, the boundary layer (slow-moving air near the blade surface) loses kinetic energy and can detach or 'separate' from the blade surface.",
        "Flow separation leads to highly turbulent flow, significant energy losses, and a drastic reduction in efficiency, directly limiting the stable pressure rise (pressure ratio) that can be achieved in a single stage. This can lead to compressor stall or surge.",
