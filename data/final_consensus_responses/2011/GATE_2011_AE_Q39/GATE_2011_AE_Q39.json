      "reasoning": "1.  **Initial State**: The aircraft is in steady level flight, meaning the lift force (L) equals the weight (W). The load factor (n) is L/W = 1.\n2.  **Inverted Flight**: The aircraft suddenly rolls 180 degrees and becomes inverted. The problem states \"no other changes are made to the configuration or controls.\" This implies that the *magnitude* of the lift generated by the wing remains the same as in steady level flight, so L = W. However, because the aircraft is inverted, the *direction* of the lift force now acts downwards, in the same direction as the aircraft's weight.\n3.  **Flight Path**: With both the lift force (L) and the weight (W) acting downwards, these forces combine to provide the necessary centripetal force for a downward circular path, characteristic of a 'pull-down' maneuver.\n4.  **Force Balance**: The total downward force providing the centripetal acceleration is the sum of lift and weight: F_c = L + W.\n    Since L = W, then F_c = W + W = 2W.\n    The centripetal force is also given by F_c = m * V^2 / R, where m is the mass, V is the speed, and R is the radius of curvature. We know m = W/g.\n    Therefore, 2W = (W/g) * V^2 / R.\n5.  **Radius Calculation**: We can cancel W from both sides:\n    2 = (1/g) * V^2 / R\n    Rearranging for R:\n    R = V^2 / (2g)\n    Given V = 50 m/s and g = 9.81 m/s^2:\n    R = (50^2) / (2 * 9.81)\n    R = 2500 / 19.62\n    R ≈ 127.42 m\n6.  **Conclusion**: The aircraft will follow a downward circular path with a speed of 50 m/s and a radius of approximately 127.4 m. This matches option C."

With no other changes to configuration or controls, the magnitude of the lift force generated by the wings remains the same as in steady level flight (L=W). However, in the inverted position, the lift force acts downwards relative to the Earth.",
        "Determine the direction of forces and identify the maneuver. In the inverted position, both the lift force (L) and the weight (W) act downwards relative to the Earth.

From Step 1 and 2, we know n=1.",
