      "reasoning": "Prandtl's lifting line theory is a fundamental linear aerodynamic theory, valid for small angles of attack. In linear aerodynamic theories, all aerodynamic forces, moments, and circulation are considered to be linearly proportional to the angle of attack. The lifting line equation itself is a linear integral equation that relates the local angle of attack to the local circulation and its spanwise derivative. Since the entire framework is linear, the circulation \\(\\Gamma(y_0)\\) at any spanwise station \\(y_0\\) will be a linear function of the overall wing angle of attack \\(\\alpha\\). If \\(\\Gamma(y_0)\\) can be expressed as \\(\\Gamma(y_0) = K(y_0) \\cdot \\alpha + C(y_0)\\), where \\(K(y_0)\\) and \\(C(y_0)\\) are coefficients that depend on the wing geometry, free-stream conditions, and zero-lift angle but are independent of \\(\\alpha\\), then the derivative \\(\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\alpha}\\) will simply be \\(K(y_0)\\). As \\(K(y_0)\\) does not contain \\(\\alpha\\), the rate of change of circulation with angle of attack is independent of \\(\\alpha\\). This is a direct consequence of the linearization inherent in the lifting line theory."
