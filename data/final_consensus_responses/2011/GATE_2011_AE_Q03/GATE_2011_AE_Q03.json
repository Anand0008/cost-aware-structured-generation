      "reasoning": "To find the minimum value of a multivariable function, we first find the critical points by setting all its first-order partial derivatives to zero. The given function is $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6x_3 + 14$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the partial derivatives with respect to each variable:**\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1 - 2$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = 2x_2 - 4$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3} = 2x_3 - 6$\n\n2.  **Set each partial derivative to zero to find the critical points:**\n    *   $2x_1 - 2 = 0 \\implies x_1 = 1$\n    *   $2x_2 - 4 = 0 \\implies x_2 = 2$\n    *   $2x_3 - 6 = 0 \\implies x_3 = 3$\n    Thus, the only critical point is $(1, 2, 3)$.\n\n3.  **Confirm this critical point is a minimum (by completing the square):**\n    Rewrite the function by completing the square for each variable:\n    $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1) + (x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 4) + (x_3^2 - 6x_3 + 9) + 14 - 1 - 4 - 9$\n    $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - 1)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 + (x_3 - 3)^2 + 0$\n    Since $(x_1 - 1)^2$, $(x_2 - 2)^2$, and $(x_3 - 3)^2$ are always non-negative, the minimum value of $f$ is 0, which occurs when each squared term is zero. This happens when $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 2$, and $x_3 = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the function has its minimum value at $(1, 2, 3)$."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Identify the nature of the function as a quadratic function in three variables with no cross-terms, implying variables can be considered independently for finding critical points.",
        "Compute the first-order partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1 - 2$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = 2x_2 - 4$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3} = 2x_3 - 6$.",
        "Set each partial derivative to zero and solve the system of equations to find the critical point: $2x_1 - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_1 = 1$; $2x_2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 2$; $2x_3 - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_3 = 3$. The critical point is $(1,2,3)$.",
        "Verify that the critical point is a minimum. Compute the Hessian matrix: $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. Since it is diagonal with positive entries, it is positive definite, confirming the critical point is a local minimum. As the function is a convex quadratic, this is also a global minimum.",
        "Alternatively, verify the minimum by completing the square: Rewrite $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_1^2 - 2x_1) + (x_2^2 - 4x_2) + (x_3^2 - 6x_3) + 14$. Completing the square for each term yields $(x_1-1)^2 - 1$, $(x_2-2)^2 - 4$, and $(x_3-3)^2 - 9$. So, $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_1-1)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 + (x_3-3)^2 + (14 -1 -4 -9) = (x_1-1)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 + (x_3-3)^2$. This expression is a sum of squares, which is minimized when each square term is zero, i.e., at $x_1=1, x_2=2, x_3=3$."

For a function like $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1-a)^2 + (x_2-b)^2 + (x_3-c)^2 + K$, the minimum value is $K$ and occurs at $(a,b,c)$. This method directly shows the nature of the extremum (minimum in this case) without needing the second derivative test.",

Cons: Requires algebraic manipulation that can be error-prone for some; not applicable for all functions (e.g., non-quadratic or more complex forms).",
