      "reasoning": "A 'positive yawing manoeuvre' implies the aircraft is actively changing its yaw orientation, which is a dynamic flight condition. The side-slip angle ($\\beta$) is defined as the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal body axis and the oncoming relative wind velocity vector. While $\\beta = 0$ is the equilibrium condition for straight and level flight, during a maneuver, $\\beta$ can take various values depending on the coordination:\n\n1.  **Coordinated Turn:** In a perfectly coordinated turn, the side-slip angle is ideally kept at or very close to zero.\n2.  **Skid:** If there is too much rudder input for the amount of bank, the aircraft will 'skid', resulting in a non-zero side-slip angle.\n3.  **Slip:** If there is too little rudder input for the amount of bank, the aircraft will 'slip', also resulting in a non-zero side-slip angle.\n\nSince a 'yawing manoeuvre' encompasses all these possibilities (from perfectly coordinated to uncoordinated), the side-slip angle is not restricted to always being zero, always positive, or always negative. It 'could be any value' depending on the specific execution and coordination of the manoeuvre. Therefore, option D is correct."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Conceptual",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Define 'positive yawing manoeuvre' and 'sideslip angle ($\\beta$)'. A positive yawing manoeuvre means the aircraft is actively changing its yaw attitude, typically involving rudder input and a change in heading, generating a positive yawing moment (nose turning left). The sideslip angle ($\\beta$) is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal body axis and the relative wind velocity vector; a positive $\\beta$ means the wind comes from the right side of the aircraft.",
        "Step 2: Explain that during a dynamic maneuver, the sideslip angle is not fixed. While $\\beta = 0$ is the ideal for coordinated flight, uncoordinated maneuvers (skids or slips) will result in non-zero sideslip. Therefore, the side-slip angle 'could be any value' depending on the specific execution and coordination of the manoeuvre.",
        "In equilibrium flight (e.g., straight and level), the sideslip angle ($\\beta$) is typically zero. However, during a dynamic 'yawing manoeuvre', the aircraft is not necessarily in equilibrium, and the sideslip angle is not inherently fixed.",
        "A yawing manoeuvre can be either coordinated or uncoordinated. In a perfectly coordinated turn, pilots use aileron and rudder to maintain $\\beta \\approx 0$. In contrast, uncoordinated maneuvers (skids or slips) result in a non-zero sideslip angle.",
        "Depending on the execution of the maneuver and the aircraft's directional stability characteristics, the sideslip angle can be positive, negative, or zero.",
        "Therefore, since the sideslip angle is controllable and situation-dependent during a yawing manoeuvre, it is not fixed to a single value or sign. It could be zero (coordinated), positive (slip/skid), or negative (slip/skid), meaning it 'could be any value' within physical limits."
