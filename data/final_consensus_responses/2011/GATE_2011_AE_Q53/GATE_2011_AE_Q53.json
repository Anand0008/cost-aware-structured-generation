      "reasoning": "The problem requires determining the thickness of a thin-walled hollow shaft to transmit a given torque with a specified factor of safety. The governing equation for maximum shear stress in a thin-walled hollow circular shaft under torsion (Bredt's formula) is given by: \\(\\tau_{max} = \\frac{T}{2 A_m t}\\)\nwhere:\n*   \\(T\\) is the applied torque.\n*   \\(A_m\\) is the area enclosed by the mean circumference of the shaft. For a circular shaft with mean radius \\(R\\), \\(A_m = \\pi R^2\\).\n*   \\(t\\) is the wall thickness.\n\nThe allowable shear stress (\\(\\tau_{allow}\\)) is determined by dividing the material's yield stress in shear (\\(\\tau_y\\)) by the factor of safety (\\(FS\\)):\n\\(\\tau_{allow} = \\frac{\\tau_y}{FS}\\)\n\nGiven data:\n*   Applied Torque, \\(T = 7 \\text{ kN-m} = 7000 \\text{ N-m}\\)\n*   Mean radius, \\(R = 5 \\text{ cm} = 0.05 \\text{ m}\\)\n*   Factor of Safety, \\(FS = 2\\)\n\nFirst, calculate the enclosed area \\(A_m\\):\n\\(A_m = \\pi R^2 = \\pi (0.05 \\text{ m})^2 = 0.0025 \\pi \\text{ m}^2\\)\n\nThis is a linked question, and without the preceding question (Q52), the specific material choice is not explicitly given. However, by calculating the required thickness for each material and comparing with the options, Material Y provides a thickness that matches one of the options.\n\nFor Material Y:\n*   Yield stress in shear, \\(\\tau_y = 225 \\text{ MPa} = 225 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2\\)\n*   Allowable shear stress, \\(\\tau_{allow} = \\frac{225 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2}{2} = 112.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2\\)\n\nNow, rearrange the thin-walled torsion formula to solve for the required thickness \\(t\\):\n\\(t = \\frac{T}{2 A_m \\tau_{allow}}\\)\nSubstitute the values:\n\\(t = \\frac{7000 \\text{ N-m}}{2 \\cdot (0.0025 \\pi \\text{ m}^2) \\cdot (112.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2)}\\)\n\\(t = \\frac{7000}{1767145.8676} \\approx 0.003961 \\text{ m}\\)\n\\(t \\approx 3.961 \\text{ mm}\\)\n\nRounding to the nearest option, \\(t \\approx 4 \\text{ mm}\\).
