The efficiency of the air intake (0.8) is likely the total pressure recovery factor, which does not affect total temperature in an adiabatic diffuser. The compressor efficiency (0.87) is used correctly to find actual temperature rise."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify given data: Flight Mach number M0 = 0.8, ambient static temperature T0 = 223.3 K, gas constant ratio γ = 1.4, compressor pressure ratio p_rc = 8, compressor isentropic efficiency η_c = 0.87. For an adiabatic air intake (diffuser), the total temperature of the air remains constant from the ambient condition to the intake exit, so Tt2 = Tt0.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the stagnation temperature at the flight condition (Tt0), which is equal to the total temperature at the intake exit (Tt2). Use the formula: Tt2 = T0 * (1 + ((γ - 1)/2) * M0^2). Plug in values: Tt2 = 223.3 * (1 + (0.4/2) * 0.8^2) = 223.3 * (1 + 0.2 * 0.64) = 223.3 * 1.128 = 251.88 K ≈ 251.9 K.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the ideal (isentropic) total temperature at the compressor exit (Tt3s). Use the isentropic relation: Tt3s = Tt2 * (p_rc)^((γ-1)/γ). Plug in values: (γ-1)/γ = 0.4/1.4 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857. Tt3s = 251.9 * (8)^(2/7) ≈ 251.9 * 1.8116 ≈ 456.4 K.",
        "Step 4: Use the compressor isentropic efficiency (η_c) to find the actual total temperature at the compressor exit (Tt3). The definition is η_c = (Tt3s - Tt2) / (Tt3 - Tt2). Rearrange to solve for Tt3: Tt3 = Tt2 + (Tt3s - Tt2) / η_c. Plug in values: Tt3 = 251.9 + (456.4 - 251.9) / 0.87 = 251.9 + 204.5 / 0.87 ≈ 251.9 + 235.06 ≈ 486.96 K ≈ 486.8 K.",
        "Step 5: The calculated total temperature at the intake exit (Tt2) is approximately 251.9 K and the actual total temperature at the compressor exit (Tt3) is approximately 486.8 K.",

It's a quick 2-3 step calculation: compute $T_{t0}$ using the Mach number formula, then use the compressor efficiency formula. Remember total temperature is constant in an adiabatic intake.",
      "guessing_heuristic": "If stuck, remember that intake efficiency does not affect total temperature, so $T_{t2}$ must be greater than $T_0$ (ambient static temperature). For the compressor, since efficiency $\\eta_c < 1$, the actual exit total temperature $T_{t3}$ must be higher than the ideal (isentropic) exit total temperature $T_{t3s}$. Use these principles to eliminate options. For example, if $T_{t3s} \\approx 456 K$, then $T_{t3}$ must be greater than $456 K$.",
      "time_management": "Allocate 2-3 minutes. The calculations are straightforward but require precision. Double-check calculator inputs. Do not overthink diffuser efficiency on temperature; focus on Mach-to-total temperature conversion and compressor efficiency. If calculation is taking longer, use the guessing heuristic."
