      "reasoning": "For an aircraft to be statically stable, its center of gravity (CG) must be located ahead of the neutral point (NP). This ensures that any disturbance in its angle of attack generates a restoring pitching moment that tends to bring the aircraft back to its original trimmed condition. Specifically, if the CG is ahead of the NP, a nose-up disturbance (increase in angle of attack) will create a nose-down restoring moment, thus ensuring static stability. Conversely, if the CG is aft of the neutral point, a nose-up disturbance would generate a further nose-up moment, leading to static instability. The neutral point (NP) is defined as the longitudinal location where the pitching moment coefficient of the entire aircraft does not change with angle of attack (i.e., \\frac{\\partial C_M}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0). The fundamental criterion for longitudinal static stability is that the slope of the pitching moment coefficient versus angle of attack must be negative: \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0. It is important to note that the wing aerodynamic centre (AC) is not the correct reference for a complete aircraft; the neutral point, which accounts for the entire aircraft including tail contributions, is the correct stability reference. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'ahead of neutral point'."

        "Understand that static longitudinal stability is determined by the relative positions of the Center of Gravity (CG) and the Neutral Point (NP). The CG is the point where the entire weight of the aircraft acts.",
        "Define the Neutral Point (NP) as the longitudinal location where the pitching moment coefficient (C_M,cg) does not change with angle of attack (i.e., \\frac{\\partial C_{M, CG}}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0). If the CG were placed at the NP, the aircraft would exhibit neutral static stability.",
        "For an aircraft to be statically stable, its Center of Gravity (CG) must be located ahead of the Neutral Point (NP). This condition ensures that a disturbance in angle of attack creates a restoring pitching moment (i.e., \\frac{\\partial C_{M, CG}}{\\partial \\alpha} < 0).",
        "Conversely, if the CG is located behind the Neutral Point (NP), the aircraft will be statically unstable. Therefore, for static longitudinal stability, the Center of Gravity must be located ahead of the Neutral Point.",
        "This corresponds to a positive static margin, which is a quantitative measure of stability."
