      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the specific impulse and thrust developed by a rocket engine under the ideal condition of a fully expanded jet. This implies that the nozzle exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$), which simplifies the thrust equation by eliminating the pressure thrust term.\n\nGiven values:\n*   Exhaust velocity ($v_e$) = 2 km/s = 2000 m/s\n*   Mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}$) = 200 kg/s\n*   Standard gravitational acceleration ($g$) = 9.81 m/s$^2$\n\n1.  **Calculate Thrust (F):**\n    For a fully expanded jet, the general thrust formula $F = \\dot{m} v_e + (P_e - P_a) A_e$ simplifies to:\n    $F = \\dot{m} v_e$\n    $F = (200 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (2000 \\text{ m/s}) = 400,000 \\text{ N} = 400 \\text{ kN}$\n\n2.  **Calculate Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$):**\n    Specific impulse is defined as the ratio of thrust to the weight flow rate of the propellant, or directly related to the exhaust velocity:\n    $I_{sp} = \\frac{v_e}{g}$\n    $I_{sp} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ m/s}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 203.87 \\text{ s}$\n\nTherefore, the specific impulse is approximately 203.87 s and the thrust developed is 400 kN, which matches option B."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and interpret the condition. The given parameters are mass flow rate ($\\dot{m} = 200 \\text{ kg/s}$), exhaust velocity ($v_e = 2 \\text{ km/s}$), and standard gravitational acceleration ($g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$). The condition 'fully expanded jet' implies that the nozzle exit pressure ($P_e$) is equal to the ambient pressure ($P_a$), which makes the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a)A_e$ zero.",
        "Step 2: Convert units for consistency. The exhaust velocity is given in km/s, so convert it to m/s: $v_e = 2 \\text{ km/s} = 2000 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 3: Apply the general rocket thrust equation and simplify it for a fully expanded jet. The general thrust equation is $F = \\dot{m} v_e + (P_e - P_a)A_e$. Since $P_e = P_a$ for a fully expanded jet, the pressure thrust term $(P_e - P_a)A_e$ becomes zero. Thus, the thrust simplifies to $F = \\dot{m} v_e$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the thrust using the simplified formula. Substitute the values: $F = (200 \\text{ kg/s}) \\times (2000 \\text{ m/s}) = 400,000 \\text{ N}$. Convert this to kilonewtons: $F = 400 \\text{ kN}$.",
        "Step 5: Apply the specific impulse formula. Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) is defined as the effective exhaust velocity divided by the standard gravitational acceleration: $I_{sp} = \\frac{v_e}{g}$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the specific impulse. Substitute the values: $I_{sp} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ m/s}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 203.873598 \\text{ s}$. Round to two decimal places: $I_{sp} \\approx 203.87 \\text{ s}$.",
        "Step 7: Verify units and compare the calculated values with the given options to select the correct answer. The calculated thrust is 400 kN and specific impulse is 203.87 s."
