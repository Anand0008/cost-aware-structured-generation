      "reasoning": "For an inviscid, adiabatic flow of a calorically perfect gas, the total enthalpy ($h_0$) and, consequently, the total temperature ($T_0$) are conserved across a shock wave. This is a fundamental principle in gas dynamics. Since the problem specifies air as a calorically perfect gas (i.e., its specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$ are constant), the total enthalpy is directly proportional to the total temperature ($h_0 = c_p T_0$). As $c_p$ is constant, the conservation of total enthalpy implies the conservation of total temperature across the shock. Therefore, the total temperature at point P (after the shock) is equal to the free stream total temperature ($T_{0P} = T_{0\\infty}$). \n\nFirst, calculate the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$) using the given ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) and the specific gas constant ($R$): \n$c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$\nGiven $\\gamma = 1.4$ and $R = 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$: \n$c_p = \\frac{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{1.4 - 1} = \\frac{401.8 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{0.4} = 1004.5 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe free stream total enthalpy is given as $h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\text{ kJ kg}^{-1}$. Convert this to Joules per kilogram:\n$h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J kg}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, calculate the total temperature using the relation $T_0 = \\frac{h_0}{c_p}$:\n$T_{0P} = T_{0\\infty} = \\frac{810 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J kg}^{-1}}{1004.5 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}} \\approx 806.3713 \\text{ K}$.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total temperature at point P is $806.37 \\text{ K}$."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the governing principle. For an inviscid, adiabatic flow across a compression corner (forming an oblique shock wave), the total enthalpy ($h_0$) is conserved. Since the flow is adiabatic, $h_0$ remains constant across the shock. For a calorically perfect gas, $h_0 = c_p T_0$, where $T_0$ is the total temperature.",
        "Step 2: Deduce total temperature conservation. Since total enthalpy ($h_0$) is conserved across the adiabatic shock, and $c_p$ is constant for a calorically perfect gas, it follows that the total temperature ($T_0$) is also conserved across the shock. Therefore, the total temperature at point P ($T_{0P}$) is equal to the free stream total temperature ($T_{0\\infty}$). This means $T_{0P} = T_{0\\infty}$.",
        "Step 3: Extract the given data. Free stream total enthalpy $h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\text{ kJ kg}^{-1}$. Ratio of specific heats $\\gamma = 1.4$. Specific gas constant $R = 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$). For a calorically perfect gas, $c_p$ can be calculated using the given ratio of specific heats ($\\gamma$) and the specific gas constant ($R$): $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma - 1}$.",
        "Step 5: Substitute the values and compute $c_p$: $c_p = \\frac{1.4 \\times 287 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{1.4 - 1} = \\frac{401.8 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}}{0.4} = 1004.5 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.",
        "Step 6: Convert the free stream total enthalpy to consistent units and set up the total temperature calculation. Given $h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\text{ kJ kg}^{-1}$, convert to Joules: $h_{0\\infty} = 810 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J kg}^{-1}$. Since $h_{0\\infty} = c_p T_{0\\infty}$, we can find $T_{0\\infty}$ using $T_{0\\infty} = \\frac{h_{0\\infty}}{c_p}$.",
        "Step 7: Perform the final calculation for the total temperature at point P. Since $T_{0P} = T_{0\\infty}$, we have $T_{0P} = \\frac{810 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J kg}^{-1}}{1004.5 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}} \\approx 806.37 \\text{ K}$."
