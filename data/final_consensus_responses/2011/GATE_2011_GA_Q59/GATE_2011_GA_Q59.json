      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the number of ways to award 3 scholarships to 4 applicants, where each applicant can receive any number of scholarships. The key is to recognize that the scholarships are distinct (e.g., Scholarship 1, Scholarship 2, Scholarship 3 are individual awards) and the choices for each scholarship are independent.\n\nConsider each scholarship individually:\n1.  For the first scholarship, there are 4 possible applicants it can be awarded to.\n2.  For the second scholarship, there are also 4 possible applicants it can be awarded to (since an applicant can receive multiple scholarships).\n3.  For the third scholarship, there are again 4 possible applicants it can be awarded to.\n\nBy the fundamental principle of counting, the total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for each scholarship:\nTotal number of ways = $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^3 = 64$.\n\nIt is important not to confuse this with a 'stars and bars' problem, which applies when identical items are distributed among distinct bins. If the scholarships were identical, the problem would be solved using combinations with repetition, yielding $\\binom{3+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways. However, the context implies distinct scholarships, leading to $4^3$ ways."
