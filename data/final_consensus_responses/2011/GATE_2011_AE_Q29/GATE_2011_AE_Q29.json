      "reasoning": "The calculation uses the standard thrust equation for turbojet engines, which accounts for both momentum and pressure forces. First, the flight velocity is calculated: V_\\infty = M \\cdot a_\\infty = 0.8 \\times 299.5 = 239.6 m/s. Next, the mass flow rate of air through the inlet is determined: \\dot{m} = \\rho_\\infty \\cdot V_\\infty \\cdot A_i = 0.413 \\times 239.6 \\times 0.7 \\approx 69.27 kg/s. Neglecting fuel mass, the total thrust T is calculated using the formula T = \\dot{m} \\cdot (V_e - V_\\infty) + (p_e - p_\\infty) \\cdot A_e. Plugging in the values: T = 69.27 \\times (500 - 239.6) + (60000 - 26500) \\times 0.4. This gives T \\approx 69.27 \\times 260.4 + 33500 \\times 0.4 \\approx 18038.5 + 13400 = 31438.5 N \\approx 31.44 kN. This calculated thrust falls within the acceptable range of 29-32 kN."
