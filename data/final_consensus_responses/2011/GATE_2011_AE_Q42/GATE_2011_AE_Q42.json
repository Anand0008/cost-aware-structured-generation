      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the eccentricity and semi-major axis of an elliptical orbit given the perigee and apogee altitudes above the Earth's surface and the Earth's radius. The solution involves converting altitudes to radial distances from the Earth's center and then applying standard formulas for semi-major axis and eccentricity.\n\nGiven:\nPerigee altitude ($h_p$) = 400 km\nApogee altitude ($h_a$) = 3400 km\nRadius of Earth ($R_E$) = 6400 km\n\n1.  **Calculate perigee radius ($r_p$):**\n    The perigee radius is the distance from the center of the Earth to the perigee point.\n    $r_p = R_E + h_p = 6400 \\text{ km} + 400 \\text{ km} = 6800 \\text{ km}$\n\n2.  **Calculate apogee radius ($r_a$):**\n    The apogee radius is the distance from the center of the Earth to the apogee point.\n    $r_a = R_E + h_a = 6400 \\text{ km} + 3400 \\text{ km} = 9800 \\text{ km}$\n\n3.  **Calculate semi-major axis ($a$):**\n    For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is the average of the apogee and perigee radii (distances from the central body). This can be derived from $r_a = a(1+e)$ and $r_p = a(1-e)$. Adding these two equations gives $r_a + r_p = 2a$.\n    $a = \\frac{r_a + r_p}{2} = \\frac{9800 \\text{ km} + 6800 \\text{ km}}{2} = \\frac{16600 \\text{ km}}{2} = 8300 \\text{ km}$\n\n4.  **Calculate eccentricity ($e$):**\n    The eccentricity can be found by subtracting the perigee radius equation from the apogee radius equation: $r_a - r_p = a(1+e) - a(1-e) = 2ae$. \n    So, $e = \\frac{r_a - r_p}{2a}$.\n    Alternatively, substituting $2a = r_a + r_p$, we get $e = \\frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p}$.\n    $e = \\frac{9800 \\text{ km} - 6800 \\text{ km}}{9800 \\text{ km} + 6800 \\text{ km}} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ km}}{16600 \\text{ km}} \\approx 0.18072$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, $e \\approx 0.18$.\n\nTherefore, the eccentricity is approximately 0.18 and the semi-major axis is 8300 km, which corresponds to Option A."

        "description": "Instead of direct geometric formulas, use conservation of angular momentum and energy to derive relations between distances and velocities, then solve for a and e. The semi-major axis can be calculated from the specific orbital energy ($\\epsilon$) using $a = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\epsilon}$, and eccentricity from specific angular momentum ($h$) and specific energy using $e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\epsilon h^2}{\\mu^2}}$.",
        "pros_cons": "Pros: More fundamental, useful when velocities are given instead of radii, provides deeper understanding. Cons: More complex and longer calculations, requires additional data (velocities), prone to more calculation errors.",
        "when_to_use": "When the problem provides velocities at specific points in the orbit (e.g., apogee or perigee), or when a deeper understanding of orbital energy and angular momentum is required for derived insights."
