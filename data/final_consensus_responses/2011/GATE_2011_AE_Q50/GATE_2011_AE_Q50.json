      "reasoning": "The question asks for the shock angle $\\beta$ for an oblique shock generated by a compression corner. We are given the upstream Mach number $M_1 = 2$ and the flow deflection angle $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$. The gas is air, assumed calorically perfect with $\\gamma = 1.4$. A fundamental principle of oblique shock waves is that the shock angle $\\beta$ must always be greater than the Mach angle $\\mu$ of the upstream flow. The Mach angle is calculated as $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/M_1)$. For $M_1 = 2$, the Mach angle is $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/2) = 30^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the shock angle $\\beta$ must be strictly greater than $30^{\\circ}$. Additionally, for an attached oblique shock, the shock angle $\\beta$ must always be greater than the flow deflection angle $\\theta$. Since $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$, options A and B are immediately ruled out. Option C ($\\beta = 30^{\\circ}$) would only be possible if $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$. Thus, the only consistent option is D. For verification, using a $\\theta-\\beta-M$ chart or solving the implicit $\\theta-\\beta-M$ equation for $M_1 = 2$ and $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$ (for $\\gamma = 1.4$), the weak shock solution for $\\beta$ is approximately $48.5^{\\circ}$, which is indeed greater than $30^{\\circ}$, confirming option D."

        "Understand the physical phenomenon: A supersonic flow encountering a compression corner generates an oblique shock wave. The shock angle $\\beta$ is related to the upstream Mach number $M_1$ and the flow deflection angle $\\theta$ by the Theta-Beta-M relation.",
        "Recall the fundamental condition for an attached oblique shock: the shock angle $\\beta$ must always be greater than the Mach angle $\\mu$ of the upstream flow.",
        "Calculate the Mach angle $\\mu$ for the given upstream Mach number $M_1 = 2$. Using the formula $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/M_1)$, we get $\\mu = \\arcsin(1/2) = 30^{\\circ}$.",
        "Apply the condition $\\beta > \\mu$. Since $\\mu = 30^{\\circ}$, the shock angle $\\beta$ must be greater than $30^{\\circ}$.",
        "Evaluate the given options based on this condition. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they suggest a shock angle less than or equal to the Mach angle for a non-zero deflection angle. Therefore, the shock angle $\\beta$ must be greater than $30^{\\circ}$.",
        "For verification, consult a $\\theta-\\beta-M$ chart or use the implicit $\\theta-\\beta-M$ equation for $M_1 = 2$ and $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$ (with $\\gamma = 1.4$). The weak shock solution yields $\\beta \\approx 48.5^{\\circ}$, which confirms that $\\beta > 30^{\\circ}$."
