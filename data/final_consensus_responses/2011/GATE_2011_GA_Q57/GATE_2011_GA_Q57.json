      "reasoning": "The sentence requires an idiomatic expression meaning 'to fulfill' or 'to make good on' promises.\n\nA. 'delivered': This option is incomplete and not the standard idiomatic expression for fulfilling promises in this context.\n\nB. 'delivered on': This is the correct idiomatic phrasal verb, meaning 'to fulfill a promise or commitment'. It perfectly fits the context where a failure to fulfill promises leads to a loss of confidence.\n\nC. 'forgot': This implies a memory lapse, which changes the nuance from a failure to act to a failure to remember, and doesn't directly address the act of fulfilling.\n\nD. 'reneged on': To 'renege on' a promise means to go back on it or break it. If the sentence were 'he *always* reneged on', it would fit. However, 'he *never* reneged on' would mean he *always* kept his promises, which contradicts the initial statement 'We lost confidence in him'. Therefore, 'delivered on' is the most appropriate choice, indicating a failure to meet expectations."

      "question_nature": "Application",

        "Understand the sentence's context and logical flow. The first clause, \"We lost confidence in him,\" is a consequence, and the second clause, \"because he never __________ the grandiose promises he had made,\" provides the reason. This implies a failure to fulfill promises.",
        "Identify the grammatical requirement: a verb or phrasal verb that describes the action (or lack thereof) regarding 'promises'.",
        "Evaluate Option A: 'delivered'. While 'deliver a promise' can be used, 'delivered' alone is not the standard idiomatic expression for fulfilling promises in this context; it sounds incomplete.",
        "Evaluate Option B: 'delivered on'. The phrasal verb 'to deliver on' (a promise, a commitment) means to fulfill it. This perfectly fits the context of not fulfilling promises, which would lead to a loss of confidence.",
        "Evaluate Option C: 'forgot'. This implies a memory lapse. However, 'never' suggests a consistent failure to act rather than just forgetting, and 'forgot the promises' is less idiomatic than 'failed to deliver on them'.",
        "Evaluate Option D: 'reneged on'. To 'renege on' a promise means to go back on it or break it. If he 'never reneged on' his promises, it means he always kept them, which would lead to *gaining* confidence, not losing it. This creates a direct logical contradiction with the first part of the sentence.",
        "Based on the evaluation, 'delivered on' is the only option that is grammatically correct, idiomatic, and logically consistent with the sentence's meaning, explaining why confidence was lost."

Students might not grasp the nuance: 'renege on' means to actively break a promise, while 'never delivered on' means to fail to fulfill it, often implying a lack of action rather than an active betrayal.

Always read the completed sentence in full to check for internal logic, as 'never reneged on' means the opposite of what is needed.",
        "consequence": "While 'reneged on' is also negative, 'delivered on' is a more direct and common antonym for failing to fulfill, making it the better fit for the sentence's implied meaning of consistent non-fulfillment. Choosing 'reneged on' creates a sentence that means the opposite of the intended message, resulting in a wrong answer."
