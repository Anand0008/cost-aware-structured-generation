      "reasoning": "The given system of equations is:\n1. `y = \\pi + x`\n2. `y = x - \\pi`\n\nRearranging both equations into the standard form `Ax + By = C` or `y = mx + c`:\nFrom equation (1): `x - y = -\\pi`\nFrom equation (2): `x - y = \\pi`\n\nWe now have two equations: `x - y = -\\pi` and `x - y = \\pi`. Since `\\pi` is a non-zero constant (approximately 3.14159), `-\\pi` is not equal to `\\pi`. Therefore, the two equations are contradictory; it is impossible for `x - y` to simultaneously equal `-\\pi` and `\\pi`.\n\nGeometrically, both equations represent straight lines. If we write them in slope-intercept form `y = mx + c`:\n1. `y = 1 \\cdot x + \\pi` (Slope `m_1 = 1`, y-intercept `c_1 = \\pi`)\n2. `y = 1 \\cdot x - \\pi` (Slope `m_2 = 1`, y-intercept `c_2 = -\\pi`)\n\nSince `m_1 = m_2` (both slopes are 1) but `c_1 \\neq c_2` (the y-intercepts `\\pi` and `-\\pi` are different), the two lines are parallel and distinct. Parallel and distinct lines never intersect, which means there is no common point `(x, y)` that satisfies both equations. Hence, the system has no solution. This aligns with option C."
