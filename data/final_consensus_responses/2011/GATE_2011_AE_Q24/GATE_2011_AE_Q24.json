      "reasoning": "The ideal thermodynamic cycle for jet engines (gas turbines) is the Brayton cycle. Specifically, jet engines operate on an open Brayton cycle. This is because they continuously draw in fresh atmospheric air, compress it, heat it via combustion, expand it through a turbine, and then exhaust it to the atmosphere, rather than recirculating a fixed working fluid in a closed loop. The Rankine cycle is not applicable to jet engines as it is used for steam power plants. Therefore, 'open Brayton cycle only' is the most accurate description."

        "Distinguish between open and closed cycles. While a theoretical closed Brayton cycle exists, actual jet engines operate as *open* cycles, continuously drawing fresh air and expelling exhaust. This eliminates options involving the Rankine cycle (used for steam power plants) and the general 'either open or closed Brayton cycle' as less precise.",
