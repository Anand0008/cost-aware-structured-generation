Recognize that for a lightly damped oscillatory mode, the eigenvalues are complex conjugates of the form \\(\\lambda = \\sigma \\pm i\\omega_d\\).",
        "Compute the damped natural frequency \\(\\omega_d\\) using the damped period \\(T_d\\): \\(\\omega_d = 2\\pi / T_d = 2\\pi / 5 \\approx 1.2566\\) rad/s \\(\\approx 1.26\\) rad/s. This will be the imaginary part of the eigenvalues.",

Given that the amplitude halves in \\(T_{1/2} = 25\\) s, we have \\(A_0 e^{\\sigma \\cdot 25} = A_0/2\\). This simplifies to \\(e^{25\\sigma} = 1/2\\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives \\(25\\sigma = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)\\). Therefore, \\(\\sigma = -\\ln(2) / 25 \\approx -0.6931 / 25 \\approx -0.027724\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) \\(\\approx -0.028\\) s\\(^{-1}\\).",
