      "reasoning": "To determine the range and endurance of the glider under equilibrium glide conditions, we use the given parameters:\nAltitude (h) = 1000 m\nLift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) = 15\nJeep speed = 54 kmph\n\nFirst, convert the jeep's speed to meters per second, as this is implicitly assumed to be the equilibrium glide speed (V) after release:\nV = 54 kmph = 54 * (1000/3600) m/s = 15 m/s.\n\n**1. Calculate the Range (R):**\nFor an equilibrium glide, the horizontal range is given by the formula:\nR = h × (L/D)\nR = 1000 m × 15 = 15000 m = 15 km.\n\n**2. Calculate the Endurance (E):**\nEndurance is the total time the glider stays airborne, which is the altitude divided by the vertical sink speed (V_v).\nFirst, find the glide angle (θ) using the lift-to-drag ratio:\n tanθ = 1 / (L/D) = 1 / 15\n\nNext, calculate the vertical sink speed (V_v). The vertical sink speed is related to the glide speed (V) and the glide angle (θ) by:\nV_v = V sinθ\n\nTo find sinθ from tanθ, use the identity sinθ = tanθ / √(1 + tan²θ):\nsinθ = (1/15) / √(1 + (1/15)²) = (1/15) / √(1 + 1/225) = (1/15) / √(226/225) = (1/15) / (√226 / 15) = 1 / √226\n\nNow, calculate V_v:\nV_v = 15 m/s × (1 / √226) ≈ 15 × 0.066519 ≈ 0.997785 m/s\n\nFinally, calculate the endurance (E):\nE = h / V_v = 1000 m / 0.997785 m/s ≈ 1002.219 s\n\nThus, the range is 15.0 km and the endurance is approximately 1002.2 s. This matches option A. The information about the glider being taken to altitude in 50 s is extraneous for calculating the glide range and endurance."

        "Step 2: Calculate the maximum glide range ($R$). The horizontal distance covered from an altitude $h$ is $R = h \\times (L/D)$. Substitute the given values: $h = 1000 \\text{ m}$ and $L/D = 15$, so $R = 1000 \\times 15 = 15000 \\text{ m} = 15 \\text{ km}$.",

        "Step 4: Calculate the glide angle ($\\theta$) using $\\tan\\theta = 1/(L/D) = 1/15$. Then, find $\\sin\\theta = \\tan\\theta / \\sqrt{1+\\tan^2\\theta} = (1/15) / \\sqrt{1+(1/15)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{226}$.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the vertical sink speed ($V_v$) using $V_v = V \\sin\\theta$. Substitute $V=15 \\text{ m/s}$ and $\\sin\\theta = 1/\\sqrt{226}$ to get $V_v = 15 / \\sqrt{226} \\approx 0.9978 \\text{ m/s}$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the endurance ($t$, time aloft during the glide) using $t = h / V_v$. Substitute $h=1000 \\text{ m}$ and $V_v \\approx 0.9978 \\text{ m/s}$ to obtain $t = 1000 / 0.9978 \\approx 1002.2 \\text{ s}$.",
