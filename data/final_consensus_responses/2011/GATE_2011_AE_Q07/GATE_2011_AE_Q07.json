      "reasoning": "The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is a simplified model for beam bending that relies on several fundamental assumptions. Key among these are:\n1.  **Plane sections remain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis after bending**. This implies that shear deformations are negligible.\n2.  **Only the longitudinal normal strain (\\epsilon_{xx}) is considered significant**, and all other strain components (transverse normal strains \\epsilon_{yy}, \\epsilon_{zz} and all shear strains \\gamma_{xy}, \\gamma_{xz}, \\gamma_{yz}) are neglected or assumed to be zero.\n3.  **Only the longitudinal normal stress (\\sigma_{xx}) is considered significant**, and all other stress components (transverse normal stresses \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz} and all shear stresses \\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz}) are considered zero, consistent with Hooke's Law and the strain assumptions.\n\nLet's analyze this against the definitions of plane stress and plane strain:\n*   **Plane Stress Condition:** A state where stress components normal to a given plane and shear stresses associated with that plane are zero. For a beam, if we consider the x-y plane of bending, this typically means \\sigma_z = 0, \\tau_{xz} = 0, \\tau_{yz} = 0. In Euler-Bernoulli theory, it is assumed that \\sigma_{zz} = 0, \\tau_{xz} = 0, and \\tau_{yz} = 0 (as all stress components other than \\sigma_{xx} are zero). Thus, the plane stress condition is satisfied.\n*   **Plane Strain Condition:** A state where strain components normal to a given plane and shear strains associated with that plane are zero. For a beam, this typically means \\epsilon_z = 0, \\gamma_{xz} = 0, \\gamma_{yz} = 0. In Euler-Bernoulli theory, it is assumed that \\epsilon_{zz} = 0, \\gamma_{xz} = 0, and \\gamma_{yz} = 0 (as all strain components other than \\epsilon_{xx} are zero). Thus, the plane strain condition is also satisfied.\n\nBecause Euler-Bernoulli theory simplifies the stress and strain states to be essentially uniaxial (only longitudinal normal stress/strain is non-zero), it simultaneously satisfies the conditions for both plane stress and plane strain. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

      "question_nature": "Conceptual",

        "Understand the fundamental assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. This theory simplifies beam analysis by assuming: (a) the material is linear elastic (obeys Hooke's Law), (b) deflections are small, (c) shear deformation is negligible, and most critically, (d) plane sections perpendicular to the beam's longitudinal axis remain plane and perpendicular to the deformed axis after bending.",
        "Analyze the implications for strain components. The assumption that \"plane sections remain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis\" directly implies that there are no shear strains ($\\gamma_{xy} = \\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0$).",
        "Furthermore, in the context of slender beams, transverse normal strains ($\\epsilon_{yy}, \\epsilon_{zz}$) are also considered negligible or zero. The only non-zero strain is the longitudinal normal strain ($\\epsilon_{xx}$).",
        "Identify the Plane Strain condition. The condition where transverse normal strains ($\\epsilon_{yy}, \\epsilon_{zz}$) and all shear strains ($\\gamma_{xy}, \\gamma_{xz}, \\gamma_{yz}$) are zero defines a state of Plane Strain. Thus, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory inherently assumes a plane strain condition.",
        "Analyze the implications for stress components. Applying Hooke's Law ($\\sigma = E\\epsilon$) to the derived strain state, since all strain components except the longitudinal normal strain ($\\epsilon_{xx}$) are considered zero, it follows that all corresponding stress components (transverse normal stresses $\\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}$ and shear stresses $\\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz}$) are also considered negligible or zero.",
        "Identify the Plane Stress condition. The condition where transverse normal stresses ($\\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}$) and all shear stresses ($\\tau_{xy}, \\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz}$) are zero defines a state of Plane Stress. Therefore, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory also inherently assumes a plane stress condition.",
        "Conclude the combined state. Based on its fundamental kinematic and constitutive assumptions, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory simplifies the stress and strain fields such that the beam is considered to be simultaneously under both Plane Stress and Plane Strain conditions. This dual condition is a simplification that allows for the derivation of the classic beam bending equation, focusing primarily on the longitudinal normal stress and strain due to bending moments."
