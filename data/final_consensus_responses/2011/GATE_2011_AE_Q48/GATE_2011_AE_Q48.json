To determine the number of boundary conditions (BCs) and initial conditions (ICs) required to solve a PDE, we look at the highest order of the derivatives with respect to each independent variable: 1. **Spatial Variable (x):** The highest order derivative with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{\\partial^4 w}{\\partial x^4}$, which is a 4th order derivative. Therefore, 4 boundary conditions are required for the spatial domain (e.g., at $x=0$ and $x=L$). 2. **Time Variable (t):** The highest order derivative with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2}$, which is a 2nd order derivative. Therefore, 2 initial conditions are required for the time domain (e.g., initial displacement and initial velocity at $t=0$). Thus, 4 BCs and 2 ICs are needed. This matches option D."
