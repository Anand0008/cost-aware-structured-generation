Let's check the given options:\n\nA. `a < 0` and `b > 0` implies `ab < 0` (Incorrect)\nB. `a > 0` and `b < 0` implies `ab < 0` (Incorrect)\nC. `a < 0` and `b < 0` implies `ab > 0` (Correct)\nD. `a = 0` and `b = 0` implies `ab = 0`. If `ab = 0`, the discriminant `D = 0`, which means the eigenvalues are real but repeated (`\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2`). The question specifies `\\lambda_1 \\neq \\lambda_2`, so this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the condition for real and distinct eigenvalues is `a < 0` and `b < 0`."
