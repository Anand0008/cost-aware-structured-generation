      "reasoning": "In Prandtl's Lifting Line Theory, the bound vortex represents the circulation around the wing and is directly responsible for generating the lift force, as described by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. The trailing vortices, which are shed from the wing due to spanwise variation in circulation, induce a downward velocity component (downwash) over the wing. This downwash effectively tilts the local lift vector rearward, creating a component in the direction of drag, known as induced drag. Therefore, statement P ('The bound vortex is responsible for the lift force') is TRUE, and statement Q ('The trailing vortices are responsible for the induced drag') is TRUE. Statements R and S are false as they incorrectly assign these roles."
