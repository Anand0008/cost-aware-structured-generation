      "reasoning": "The flow over a spinning circular cylinder with circulation is modeled by superimposing three elementary potential flows: a uniform flow, a doublet, and a vortex. The stream function for each component is:\n1.  **Uniform flow:** \\psi_{\\text{uniform}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta\n2.  **Doublet:** A doublet of strength \\mu at the origin, when combined with a uniform flow, forms a circular cylinder of radius R. The stream function for the doublet is \\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta. For a cylinder of radius R, \\mu = 2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2. Substituting this, \\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta = -V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta.\n3.  **Vortex:** For a counter-clockwise circulation \\Gamma, the stream function for a point vortex at the origin is \\psi_{\\text{vortex}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r).\n\nCombining these, the total stream function is:\n\\psi = \\psi_{\\text{uniform}} + \\psi_{\\text{doublet}} + \\psi_{\\text{vortex}}\n\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta - V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)\n\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)\n\nThe question specifies that \\psi = 0 on the cylinder surface (r=R). Let's check the value of this stream function at r=R:\n\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)\n\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R (0) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)\n\nTo ensure \\psi = 0 at r=R, we must subtract the constant term \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R) from the stream function. This is equivalent to replacing \\ln(r) with \\ln(r) - \\ln(R) = \\ln(r/R).\n\nTherefore, the stream function satisfying \\psi = 0 at r=R is:\n\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n\nThis expression matches option C exactly."

        "Understand the physical model: Potential flow over a spinning circular cylinder is represented by the superposition of a uniform flow, a doublet (to form the cylinder), and a point vortex (to account for circulation).",
        "Recall the stream functions for the elementary flows in polar coordinates: uniform flow (\\psi_{\\text{uniform}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta), doublet (\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta), and point vortex (\\psi_{\\text{vortex}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln r).",
        "Recall the stream function for a doublet. A doublet of strength $\\mu$ at the origin has a stream function $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi r} \\sin\\theta$. For a circular cylinder of radius $R$ to be formed by combining uniform flow and a doublet, the doublet strength is related by $\\mu = 2\\pi V_{\\text{inf}} R^2$. Substituting this, $\\psi_{\\text{doublet}} = -V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta$.",
        "Combine the uniform flow and doublet stream functions to get the stream function for a non-spinning cylinder. $\\psi_{\\text{cylinder, no circ}} = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\sin\\theta - V_{\\text{inf}} \\frac{R^2}{r} \\sin\\theta = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta$.",
        "Recall the stream function for a point vortex. For a counter-clockwise circulation $\\Gamma$, the stream function for a point vortex at the origin is $\\psi_{\\text{vortex}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$. (Note: Sign conventions for the vortex stream function can vary between textbooks; this convention is consistent with the correct option and widely used, e.g., Anderson).",
        "Superimpose all three stream functions to get the initial combined stream function: $\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(r)$.",
        "Apply the boundary condition that $\\psi = 0$ on the cylinder surface ($r=R$). Evaluate the current stream function at $r=R$: $\\psi(r=R) = V_{\\text{inf}} R \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{R^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R) = 0 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$.",
        "Adjust the stream function to satisfy the boundary condition. Since stream function is defined up to an arbitrary constant, we can subtract $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln(R)$ from the entire expression to make $\\psi=0$ at $r=R$. This leads to replacing $\\ln(r)$ with $\\ln(r) - \\ln(R) = \\ln(r/R)$. The final stream function is $\\psi = V_{\\text{inf}} r \\left(1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)$."
