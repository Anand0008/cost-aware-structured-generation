'Resignation' means the acceptance of something undesirable but inevitable.\n*   C. 'Suspicion' means a feeling or belief that someone is guilty of an illegal or dishonest act without proof.\n*   D. 'Contempt' means the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath consideration, worthless, or deserving scorn; disregard for something that should be taken into account.\n\nComparing the meanings, 'Deference' (respect, submission) is directly opposite to 'Contempt' (scorn, disrespect, disregard). Therefore, option D is the most nearly opposite in meaning."
