      "reasoning": "Propulsion efficiency ($\\eta_P$) is fundamentally defined as the ratio of the useful thrust power ($P_T$) produced by the engine to the rate of kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust jet relative to the incoming air. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$\\eta_P = \\frac{\\text{Thrust Power}}{\\text{Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   Thrust Power ($P_T$) is given by $T \\cdot U$, where $T$ is the net thrust and $U$ is the flight velocity.\n*   The Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is the air mass flow rate, $U_e$ is the exhaust velocity, and $U$ is the flight velocity (assuming negligible fuel mass and fully expanded nozzle).\n\nSubstituting these into the propulsion efficiency formula:\n\n$\\eta_P = \\frac{T \\cdot U}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)}$\n\nFrom this equation, we can observe the following relationships:\n1.  Propulsion efficiency ($\\eta_P$) is in the numerator with the Thrust Power ($T \\cdot U$). Therefore, $\\eta_P$ is **directly proportional** to the thrust power.\n2.  Propulsion efficiency ($\\eta_P$) is in the denominator with the air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_a$). Therefore, $\\eta_P$ is **inversely proportional** to the air mass flow rate.\n\nA common simplified formula, $\\eta_P = \\frac{2U}{U_e+U}$, can be derived by substituting $T = \\dot{m}_a (U_e - U)$. However, this simplified form can sometimes obscure the direct dependence on thrust power and inverse dependence on mass flow rate if not carefully considered in the context of the primary definition.\n\nOption C, 'directly proportional to the thrust power and inversely proportional to the air mass flow rate', accurately describes these relationships."

      "step_by_step": [
        "Recall the fundamental definition of propulsion efficiency ($\\eta_P$). It is the ratio of useful thrust power to the rate of kinetic energy imparted to the exhaust stream relative to the incoming air.",
        "Write the general formula for propulsion efficiency as the ratio of useful thrust power to the rate of kinetic energy imparted to the jet: $\\eta_P = \\frac{\\text{Thrust Power}}{\\text{Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet}}$.",
        "Identify the mathematical expressions for 'Thrust Power' and 'Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet'. Thrust Power ($P_T$) is $T \\cdot U$. The Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet is $\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)$, where $\\dot{m}_a$ is the air mass flow rate, $U_e$ is the exhaust velocity, and $U$ is the flight velocity. Also, apply common simplifying assumptions: fuel mass flow is negligible ($\\dot{m}_f \\ll \\dot{m}_a$), so $\\dot{m}_e \\approx \\dot{m}_a = \\dot{m}$, and the nozzle is perfectly expanded (pressure thrust negligible). The thrust equation simplifies to $T = \\dot{m}(U_e - U)$.",
        "Substitute the expressions for Thrust Power and Rate of Kinetic Energy imparted to the jet, along with the simplified thrust equation, into the propulsion efficiency formula: $\\eta_P = \\frac{T \\cdot U}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_a(U_e - U)U}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)}$.",
        "Simplify the expression: $\\eta_P = \\frac{\\dot{m}_a(U_e - U)U}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e - U)(U_e + U)} = \\frac{2U}{U_e + U}$. This simplified form shows $\\eta_P$ depends only on flight speed ($U$) and exhaust speed ($U_e$). However, to analyze the proportionality with respect to 'Thrust Power' ($T \\cdot U$) and 'air mass flow rate' ($\\dot{m}_a$), it is better to use the definition before full substitution: $\\eta_P = \\frac{T \\cdot U}{\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{m}_a (U_e^2 - U^2)}$. From this, if $U$ and $U_e$ are considered fixed, $\\eta_P$ is directly proportional to thrust power ($T \\cdot U$) and inversely proportional to air mass flow rate ($\\dot{m}_a$). This is the relationship asked in the question.",
